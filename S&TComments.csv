XvkEExdl-w4;Yeah science does make me question god
XvkEExdl-w4;Magnetic force is stopping the metal ball against Gravitational force. It is amazing to see na engineers!
XvkEExdl-w4;where can i get  mega levitator???
XvkEExdl-w4;If you need #1 you've got #2 for brains.
XvkEExdl-w4;Muito bom.pq não vem pra i Brasil esses brinquedo??

XvkEExdl-w4;My cat would like that sand scrpt thing!
XvkEExdl-w4;‍💻Things you can do with them cooper coil bench cookers ( 4get there name? ) 😳👍  uno its got a copper coil & electro power when on u  can do stuff :) 🤷‍♂️🎥🥇
XvkEExdl-w4;How does that  levitating device work? I think having two poles that are the same being  forced close to each other in a controlled condition?   Two south poles repel and so do two north poles.  Control that force would produce a levitating force.
XvkEExdl-w4;2:58 that’s how chrome eats up all the memory of my PC

XvkEExdl-w4;That magnetic putty ate that magnet
XvkEExdl-w4;Mantap
XvkEExdl-w4;I have one of those mag. Putty's
XvkEExdl-w4;I like how when you send force to an object while spinning levitated it can spin faster because magnets are constantly pushing making it faster and faster to know limit where it can surpass the speed of light but I doubt that will happen because it will wear of the magnet or take too long.
XvkEExdl-w4;05:20:00 AM
XvkEExdl-w4;amazing

7sExF5B4G-U;I have OnePlus 7 pro it's not in this list😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
7sExF5B4G-U;The realme x2 pro is the best buy.

7sExF5B4G-U;Price check
7sExF5B4G-U;Do they all have wireless charging
7sExF5B4G-U;Razer phone 2 should definently be on the gaming phone list. And in my opinion the s10e should replace the iPhone 11 it has a much better display
7sExF5B4G-U;You forgot to include the a70. It can it’s a 35MP camera and 8GB and charges faster then the s10+. Keep in mind, it’s only in certain parts of the us and Canada. The best way to buy this phone though, is to go to Toronto because they sell them there. The price is $499CAD
7sExF5B4G-U;Im mad There is not OnePlus in top gaming

7sExF5B4G-U;I have the Huawei Nova 5T and as far as im using it I dont regret anything. From gaming to Camera performance with 48MP main camera and 32MP front camera and with 8GB Ram 128GB rom Good for gaming
7sExF5B4G-U;Who buys a phone for gaming?
7sExF5B4G-U;Best Vid
7sExF5B4G-U;Even though the camera on the rig phone 2 is incredible especially if you using the $500 version btw you can get a cheaper asus right phone just with less storage. 500$ = 128gb which is more than enough for a phone depending how you use it.

7sExF5B4G-U;ULTRA POOR after watching all these phones that I can't even afford one phone
7sExF5B4G-U;S10 or S10+???? Helppp

7sExF5B4G-U;😊

7sExF5B4G-U;Lul pixel 4 it beat IPHONE 11 PRO MAX SOLID
7sExF5B4G-U;All those Chinese phones have confusing names & too similar to each other. I wish a grade one brand like Apple or Samsung makes a good value phone around $500
7sExF5B4G-U;Can you please check all the Samsung A series? There are so many devices its confusing...
7sExF5B4G-U;My Bank Account says No 😒
7sExF5B4G-U;Where is Zenfone
7sExF5B4G-U;A90 should be ln thiz list
7sExF5B4G-U;Picked up a realme x2 Pro master edition.  My other choice was the mate 30 pro but I hate curved screens.  I may still get the Mi 10 when it comes out but it will probably have a curve as well, still both phone cheaper then 1 iPhone lol.

7sExF5B4G-U;How do I buy a Huawei mate 30 pro?
7sExF5B4G-U;"Samsung missed a chance to use ""Two UI"" for their skin name."
7sExF5B4G-U;The best is iPhone 11 max
7sExF5B4G-U;Samsung s10e is pretty good
7sExF5B4G-U;Why would someone buy a phone for gaming...
7sExF5B4G-U;Why isnt the S10e on the affordable Phones?

7sExF5B4G-U;plz plz plz can anyone tell me how do i get wallpaper animation like in
7sExF5B4G-U;0:53 to 0:56
7sExF5B4G-U;Still using a $100 phone in 2019... This video hurt me good 😥💔
7sExF5B4G-U;Audio problem at 6mn15sec.
7sExF5B4G-U;06:00:00 AM
7sExF5B4G-U;First time I've seen a mistake in the final edition. Something I'd do everytime I edit a video if I was into this job... 😂
7sExF5B4G-U;Make a video about Infinix hot s3x plzzzz
7sExF5B4G-U;Mwahqhahaha battery power? The best is well it’s not the best but after 3 years it still lasts for like 12 hours but it’s a tablet and it’s the iPad mini 2
7sExF5B4G-U;Bold n1
7sExF5B4G-U;hold on hold on hold on ...
7sExF5B4G-U;what, exactly, do you mean by AFFORDABLE when the cell phone is 400 usd or above?
7sExF5B4G-U;this is NOT affordable
7sExF5B4G-U;this is ABYTHING BUT affordable
7sExF5B4G-U;I bought the HP30 pro 2 months ago and all my G_apps works flawlessly and I got very surprised, but very happy when the phone couple of weeks ago the EMUI automatically downloaded and upgrade to the latest Android 10. The hole process only took a few minutes ! Now I'm not sure if it is because the fact that I live in Sweden, or if simply Huawei and the U.S have work't out there differences. So I'm so glad I chose the P30 pro Its the best phone Iv'e had in a long time, and the camera is just sick !
7sExF5B4G-U;In indonesia,the rog 2 is like 575 dollars
7sExF5B4G-U;Teacher : Where's your homework ?
7sExF5B4G-U;Me :    8:05

7sExF5B4G-U;"S10+ Is The Best Phone Of The Year; IN MY OPINION."
7sExF5B4G-U;I have a redmi note 8 pro
7sExF5B4G-U;5G is kind of bad at the moment with the lack of towers .
7sExF5B4G-U;I LOVE THIS TECH CHANNEL 💙LOVE U AARON 💙CAME TO EARLY SO EXCITED
7sExF5B4G-U;I normally like all of your videos, but the fact that you had to nitpick about a mobile processor making a phone a runner up just made me laugh. You make the Snapdragon 845 sound like a bad mobile chip when it isn't bad at all and those chips that have come after it aren't so much better that the 845 deserves to be nitpicked about.
7sExF5B4G-U;Fblus
7sExF5B4G-U;Stop wasting ur time with the comment section...all talking abt the glitch in mid video
7sExF5B4G-U;Very good presentation, straight to the point, no waste of time, calm and relaxed voice, simple and clean set-up to make you focus on the video and over all great experience with good advices.
7sExF5B4G-U;This man needs more subs i subbed, liked and gonna share.
7sExF5B4G-U;Right now i still use my S8 but the battery is my biggest issue. After watch the video i still don'T know what to do^^ The plan was to switch to apple but the price is just to high for the pro in my opinion
7sExF5B4G-U;I feel bad for coolpad
7sExF5B4G-U;good.........

7sExF5B4G-U;OnePlus Gang where u at?❤️❤️❤️
7sExF5B4G-U;Thanks for the recommendation.  I am seriously considering the Nex 3, however for the price I feel it is extremely lacking. I mean look at the Realme X2pro that can give you a 12gb ram.  Although I really like the size of the Nex 3, I'm looking for a phone that will last me 3 yrs.
7sExF5B4G-U;I still love my S9+.
7sExF5B4G-U;Hey there. I watch your smartphone reviews alot and I would really appreciate it if you would do an honest review on my daily driver that I love and really think needs a mention. Umidigi Power.

7sExF5B4G-U;OnePlus 7 Pro deserves to be here. I know there's the OnePlus 7T Pro, but still the original OnePlus 7 Pro should have been in here.
7sExF5B4G-U;I'm glade you included the LG g8x
7sExF5B4G-U;Well i only have iPhone 4 its been 9 years and it cant even load a Microsoft Word😭😭😭

7sExF5B4G-U;What happened  to Samsung Galaxy A 70  best budget phone I ever seen.... please take a look at the A70  by Samsung
7sExF5B4G-U;When you see a Z, why do you say Zed?

7sExF5B4G-U;I can't afford any of them. Still using Asus ZenFone 4 Max, not even the Pro version. Lol
7sExF5B4G-U;Kash koyi mujhe ek phone gift karti 😢😢😢
7sExF5B4G-U;"Pretty good ranking, except the ""bang for your buck"" phones are honestly a little expensive here, considering we had phones like the Redmi Note 7 and the Realme 5 this year"
7sExF5B4G-U;But the Note 10+ and the top of the line One Plus phones are the overall kings for me.
7sExF5B4G-U;Cool
7sExF5B4G-U;Love to see a review of best entry phones for 2019 as not everyone can afford or need the top of range phones.
7sExF5B4G-U;Nothing this year has piqued my interest as much as the ASUS ROG Phone II. What a ridiculously stacked phone, and priced so aggressively too. Easy buy.
7sExF5B4G-U;K20 Pro Is Very Good Mobile Like 🔥👍
7sExF5B4G-U;Good morning all my friends
7sExF5B4G-U;I Love you Dear friends 🔥

7sExF5B4G-U;The expression at 8:04 is awesome though😂
7sExF5B4G-U;S10 PLUS is the phone for me in 2019
7sExF5B4G-U;I can't go back to 60hz after using 90hz.
7sExF5B4G-U;who else thinks the S10e is one of the best for the price
7sExF5B4G-U;Says lack of storage and poor battery life for the Pixel. Here I am sitting with the 128gb version and my phone battery lasting all day.
7sExF5B4G-U;"FACT"""
7sExF5B4G-U;"""Best smartphone of 2019 are S10 Plus & NOTE 10 Plus"""

7sExF5B4G-U;6:11 , thought my one plus 7t pro was broken 😂
7sExF5B4G-U;Best phones 2019 are those who still have a 16:9 screen and not one of those stupid tall screens.

7sExF5B4G-U;Huawei mate 30 pro
7sExF5B4G-U;Didn't see any of the a series from samsung that deserved to be in this video that is definitely better than the s10 or s10 plus

7sExF5B4G-U;Cheaper and better than some phones
7sExF5B4G-U;Finally, The Best Smartphone in 2019 is Huawei Mate 30 Pro.

7sExF5B4G-U;This boy look smart
7sExF5B4G-U;He should make a YouTube channel .

7sExF5B4G-U;Who else thinks the Oneplus 7 Pro is the 2019 king?
7sExF5B4G-U;The best phone in 2019 is still the XR. 🤣✌️
7sExF5B4G-U;I wish i could have one of any flagship phone❤❤

7sExF5B4G-U;28 phones. How about a top 10 my guy
7sExF5B4G-U;The M30 Pro 5g is even more powerful.
7sExF5B4G-U;compares mid range xiaomi to rog phone 2
7sExF5B4G-U;This guy knows ALL the phones, I didnt know 80% of them
7sExF5B4G-U;have you heard of Smartisan Nut Pro 3?
7sExF5B4G-U;TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS MANY PHONES AT YOUR DISPOSAL GEEZZZZZ 😩😩🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
7sExF5B4G-U;Its confusing. Its because you review one feature then miss out in another phone. Like in Camera specs and battery life.
7sExF5B4G-U;So what happened to all those phones now? 🤯😆
7sExF5B4G-U;Where's the xiaomi note 10
7sExF5B4G-U;For the first time I wouldn't pick the oneplus. Realme x2 pro is the winner.
7sExF5B4G-U;Can i have the Vivo Nex 3?
7sExF5B4G-U;OMG... Mate30 pro... What a phone! 😯But expensive
7sExF5B4G-U;ok what happened at 6:11
7sExF5B4G-U;I find it a bit unsettling how he pronounces the ROG Phone 2 as 'rog'
7sExF5B4G-U;I still use a snapdragon 435... Yet he said that a snapdragon 845 is outdated ...
7sExF5B4G-U;Where is the Xperia 1 & Xperia 5? They both have the best display & true to life colors! +natural images
7sExF5B4G-U;Good job and good selection for top 1 and the rest...i think Pixel 4 should have been in top 20 atleast
7sExF5B4G-U;U missing the realme phone......
7sExF5B4G-U;You played it safe and you're catering to the manufacturers. Not what I subbed for.

7sExF5B4G-U;You basically just showed 28 phones...
7sExF5B4G-U;iPhone shouldn't be on the list ! 🙄🤮
7sExF5B4G-U;Plot Twist: I can't afford any of these
7sExF5B4G-U;Huawei Mate 30 pro 5G : the best phone of 2019....

7sExF5B4G-U;you didn't mention s10e ? seriously ? the value king for 2019 ? better than iphone 11
7sExF5B4G-U;Rog phone 2 is the best.
7sExF5B4G-U;Out of all these phones, how many of them have a removable battery? I won't buy a phone without one. Besides that, I'm incredibly unimpressed with everything I am seeing here.
7sExF5B4G-U;mate 30 pro is the best phone for 2019
7sExF5B4G-U;Nobody:
7sExF5B4G-U;Not even a single soul
7sExF5B4G-U;Does nobody care of a phone has removable storage (micro SD) anymore? With all this talk of high end photos and videos with all these fancy cameras doesnt anybody want to be able to swap out a full card?
7sExF5B4G-U;Can you give mobile phone free

7sExF5B4G-U;One UI...
7sExF5B4G-U;2
7sExF5B4G-U;wheres asus rog 2??
7sExF5B4G-U;Huawei all the way 😍😍😍👌👌👌
7sExF5B4G-U;u forget samsung a70 for best budget phone
7sExF5B4G-U;Galaxy S10+ is the champ! It's the best blend of topnotchness and value. Of course, if you want the best of the best, then the Note10+ is the king. And if you like iOS, then obviously it's the 11 Pro Max.
7sExF5B4G-U;3:10 - Gaming phones
7sExF5B4G-U;4:20 (lol) - Value phones
7sExF5B4G-U;7:24 - flagships
7sExF5B4G-U;I think the best phone is... Oppo Reno Ace
7sExF5B4G-U;65W, Hi-Fi audio, Snapdragon 855+, $500~$600 And long bettery... WOW
7sExF5B4G-U;i mean i got the 7t pro and its insane but the 7 pro definitely deserves a mention for the much lower price
7sExF5B4G-U;hey mahn do make a video on a7 2018
7sExF5B4G-U;What i do not like, is that ur mentioning the launch prices and not the curent ones.
7sExF5B4G-U;But good video 👍
7sExF5B4G-U;This vid has been banned by the US gov
7sExF5B4G-U;he is in the top 20 simon cowel impersonators! then slightly went towards paul mckenna. still not decided on a phone so might hang on till 2020 and save up for the next version of iphone 11pro max! avoiding galaxy notes all together!
7sExF5B4G-U;S10 plus all the way
7sExF5B4G-U;Mrwhosetheboss can you please do an realme XT unboxing AND reaview.TY.
7sExF5B4G-U;huawei is the best choice! Mate30pro is a MONSTER!
7sExF5B4G-U;iPhone affordable?
7sExF5B4G-U;With a budget of 400$, would you rather get an old flagship phone or a new midrange phone??
7sExF5B4G-U;So I have a OnePlus 5 and it is time I update my phone, however I am confused because the saturation of phones in the market. Can someone recommend me the best phone for me? I use my phone mainly for photos and gaming, my budget is 750. Thanks in advance.
7sExF5B4G-U;Galaxy note 10 plus ftw. For sure
7sExF5B4G-U;This vid made very lil sense to me!
7sExF5B4G-U;F up the video there were three of this guy talking
7sExF5B4G-U;I'm going to be buying the Pixel 3A  on Black Friday for $270! 😃
7sExF5B4G-U;huawei mate 30 ppro is the all founder boss!
7sExF5B4G-U;I've had alot of phones and I stuck with the galaxy line cuz they really take good care of their software unlike other phone companies especially nubia I've had one update on my rm3 in the last year doesnt matter how good your hardware is if there is no software to back it up
7sExF5B4G-U;A13 is brutal for gaming
7sExF5B4G-U;with was that audio glitch and no thats not the MacBook lol
7sExF5B4G-U;is the LG G8X ThinQ available in the UK?
7sExF5B4G-U;Lol at 6min 12sec the talking
7sExF5B4G-U;key word is PRICE...So which one can one afford
7sExF5B4G-U;Did he just say rogphone
7sExF5B4G-U;7t pro, mate 30 pro are the best
7sExF5B4G-U;Prefer S10 in Snapdragon variant . Really hope that Samsung could make the battery lasts longer ♥ All time fav - Samsung but I like the design of Huawei 😚
7sExF5B4G-U;Mate 30 pro
7sExF5B4G-U;LG just fired the battery guy...
7sExF5B4G-U;For budget you could have put the a70
7sExF5B4G-U;stop looking at the script
7sExF5B4G-U;#Top 10 smartphones of 2019
7sExF5B4G-U;-oneplus 7T pro
7sExF5B4G-U;-Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
7sExF5B4G-U;-Huawei Mate 30 pro(ban problems though)
7sExF5B4G-U;I have the galaxy s10 and the red magic 3 for gaming couldn't be happier. My s10 is always on 5g where I live it's pretty good but its display and speaker setup is just incredible awesome media consumption phone
7sExF5B4G-U;There  is only one phone- iphone, second maybe galaxy or note 10
7sExF5B4G-U;Akehmen hp ne
7sExF5B4G-U;S9 gang
7sExF5B4G-U;S10+ didn't really like seem a bit sluggish compared to my OP6
7sExF5B4G-U;Donate all em phones to people who subscribed to you 😂. No really.
7sExF5B4G-U;Why are you playing CODM on a tablet and not using the 4 finger claw?
7sExF5B4G-U;I  miss only a  List from this best list..
7sExF5B4G-U;note 9 should have been on the list for more reasons than phones on that table
7sExF5B4G-U;Nice
7sExF5B4G-U;I only came for Samsung tbh
7sExF5B4G-U;For me is a series best like a50 a70 a80
7sExF5B4G-U;Like the worst top 20 video ever made haha.
7sExF5B4G-U;I used to have Huawei P9 lite model before those new Huawei came up and I was satisfied. Good camera, storage, quick charging, long lasting battery and reasonable price. However my front screen cracked while I was working and hudge and I dropped have brick on a screen it still works but to fix a screen it would cost me £200 and I get advice to instead fixining just add some more cash and get a better phone. So after that accident which occurred I decided to buy honor 8x and I am really satisfied afortable than the new Huawei, Samsung and Iphones altogether combined. Really long lasting battery, good storage, high quality of camera as well. I really recommend and later on when I bought it I found out honor is under Huawei. Maybe that is why and I like the design of it. To me the most important in phones is battery because when the battery is good all the futures will be as well. Just look at the battery storage and how long will last. This is how I choose my phone and make sure it is afortable as well it is depends how much is it cost. I paid if I am not mistaken £210-£230 something like that and I am have honor for nearly 2 years and battery is still the same and I am none stop using WiFi, playing or listening to music. Sometimes even my battery if I am not using very often can last up 3-4 days not chargering at all. But when I am using can last up to 2 days and half.
7sExF5B4G-U;End is mate 30 pro tecnology iff google back than iphone is dead😂😂
7sExF5B4G-U;What phone do u guys have
7sExF5B4G-U;GIVE ME ONE MOBILE AS GIFT
7sExF5B4G-U;8:05 which expression was that ? 😂😂
7sExF5B4G-U;Rog ii
7sExF5B4G-U;Nubia z20  got stuck
7sExF5B4G-U;This is why apple is up there. They do stuff people want.
7sExF5B4G-U;They don't give a phone 2 screens. Than make it fold.
7sExF5B4G-U;where is the rog

7sExF5B4G-U;Man control your hand ... you do a very poor copy of MKBHD
7sExF5B4G-U;On Mate 30 Pro no Google Apps from the box (for known reason), cannot buy it in Europe (for known reason), also personal preference I don't like notch.. So I better stick on P30 Pro, it's still have very decent camera
7sExF5B4G-U;Brother is there any glitch in this video....there is a overlap
7sExF5B4G-U;How about the samsung s10e
7sExF5B4G-U;Confusing video with no plan. Did not enjoy it.
7sExF5B4G-U;5:04 I thought it costs $350 US dollars?
7sExF5B4G-U;Watching on my Red Magic 3s best gaming phone i've had and fast 1 day shipping
7sExF5B4G-U;06:15:00 AM

7sExF5B4G-U;Mr. Whose the boss always has the best videos 🔥🔥
7sExF5B4G-U;Go look at 6:13 I seriously thought my phone had broken. I had to replay it like a thousand times to make sure it was the video!
7sExF5B4G-U;Great! This list will come handy 2 years from now, just like your recommended phones 2 years ago is what I watched to find an affordable but good phone in 2019!
7sExF5B4G-U;This guy is so amazing,i wish we can meet in the near future
7sExF5B4G-U;6:12 you messed up your editing.
7sExF5B4G-U;This review nailed it! Thanks bro
7sExF5B4G-U;OnePlus 7 Pro might be my favorite phone of the year. It came out in the beginning of 2019. By the end of 2019, I'd say it rivals flagships at the time while being hundreds of dollars cheaper. It's display and screen was revolutionary, especially since it's basically the only pop up camera available in Western countries.
7sExF5B4G-U;6:12 What Happened Man??? You uploaded a glitch.
7sExF5B4G-U;9:54 *cough*  slofies *cough*

7sExF5B4G-U;I just don't understand that even with all these recommendations, there is just no way Xiaomi or Huawei phones will work properly in the US due to band limitations. A highly spec phone with SD 855 but can't have access to LTE is just sad. He's got to point these vital details.
7sExF5B4G-U;Hello if you are reading this will you be able to give out a oneplus 5 for I am a student who needs one
7sExF5B4G-U;Bro do you sell back the Phone you  brought
7sExF5B4G-U;There's another word for the rog phone 2 it's an absolute unit
7sExF5B4G-U;Pixel 4 XL is VERY underrated ignore the spec sheet and use the phone it's amazing, screen is excellent, software is very helpful, battery life is underrated, design is best so far and feel amazing in the hand.
7sExF5B4G-U;The double talk was UN REAL
7sExF5B4G-U;Very confusing bud
7sExF5B4G-U;They're all the same.
7sExF5B4G-U;And what about the s10e? i think thats the best vaule smartphone also. I am buying that phone soon :)
7sExF5B4G-U;K20 Pro definitely should be top 3.
7sExF5B4G-U;What about the razor phone 2
7sExF5B4G-U;I just bought the iPhone 11 or Mac and am returning it for the pixel 4xl.
7sExF5B4G-U;lg g6 should made top 3
7sExF5B4G-U;How come this guy have so many followers 🙁
7sExF5B4G-U;2019: apple year
7sExF5B4G-U;Iphone 11 pro max rocks💯
7sExF5B4G-U;Reupload please
7sExF5B4G-U;Where’s Nokia 3310??!
7sExF5B4G-U;Anyone else notice the fault 6:12
7sExF5B4G-U;you are by far the best content creator out there. I cannot stop marveling informative and well-paced your videos are. I also recognise the significant financial commitment you put into acquiring these devices. Keep up the good work.

7sExF5B4G-U;MAKE A GALAXY A50 REVIEW
7sExF5B4G-U;Hey dude your voice is super base sound voice
7sExF5B4G-U;at 6:12 you made a mistake
7sExF5B4G-U;Don't agree with your views over the phone. This sounds more like a paid video as its biased
7sExF5B4G-U;Awesome video man
7sExF5B4G-U;I don't have a phone ........ Can you give one hahahhahahahahahahaha
7sExF5B4G-U;I want air triggers on iPhone 12
7sExF5B4G-U;Why do you trust Chinese hardware/software so much? Can you give me even one reason?
7sExF5B4G-U;5 cameras but no ultrawide or telephoto 😞
7sExF5B4G-U;Is there a good phone which is small enough to be operated by one hand? Something like Iphone 5s and SE?
7sExF5B4G-U;Gaming has become a codeword for hideous design
7sExF5B4G-U;What about the iPhone  11 pro  max
7sExF5B4G-U;I cant believe the year is almost over
7sExF5B4G-U;Iphone 7
7sExF5B4G-U;Nice
7sExF5B4G-U;I got the p30 pro before the ban and I will not jump ship! The battery life is insane the camera is even more so.
7sExF5B4G-U;Dude, no matter which way you dice it - putting the iPhone 11 in the value category is just plain silly. It's not a value phone at all. In NZ right now it starts at $1350. That's ridiculously expensive.
7sExF5B4G-U;Samsung, Huawei & Apple are the best smartphone brands to choose from
7sExF5B4G-U;I'm poor
7sExF5B4G-U;Xioami mi 9t is good
7sExF5B4G-U;this is just miss universe but phones
7sExF5B4G-U;Good
7sExF5B4G-U;Now I should decide.
7sExF5B4G-U;In Croatia Iphone 11 is 1000 dollars
7sExF5B4G-U;Mate all the huawei phones before mate 30 have google services...so p30 pro also has google services
7sExF5B4G-U;sir you got a bunch of smartphone. opposite of me . can u send me any 1 of those . especially gaming phone. im unable to buy coz im not that rich. im from PHILIPPINES.  a bunch of huge thanks if you consider it.
7sExF5B4G-U;Wow my parents have note 10s my mom has a plus and my dad has a regular and I have an iPhone XS
7sExF5B4G-U;redmi k20 pro
7sExF5B4G-U;Arun : *talking
7sExF5B4G-U;Also arun : *talking
7sExF5B4G-U;Realme is copying redmi in design and camera and copying oppo in software and battery and charging thats why I hate it
7sExF5B4G-U;Um, Pixel 4 should have been in the 10th runner up, meaning not even in the top 10 :)
7sExF5B4G-U;I'm not surprised the LG G8X Thinq being in the top 5 XD
7sExF5B4G-U;How can you talk flagship cameras and leave out that Oppo Reno 10x right in the center of the desk??
7sExF5B4G-U;Dear Mrwhosetheboss, which phone is better, huawei mate 30 or oneplus 7t and in my country their prices are similar 🤔
7sExF5B4G-U;R.I.P for those smartphones  that did not make it to the top 20. i feel sorry  for Huawei. am a crazy fan of huawei
7sExF5B4G-U;Where is pixel 4xl
7sExF5B4G-U;6:12 what happened bro I thought my phone just lagged
7sExF5B4G-U;6:12 editing mistake ..
7sExF5B4G-U;6:12 I thought you were making an amazing point on how dual screen can get confusing 😂
7sExF5B4G-U;meh,. its basically all phones in 2019...
7sExF5B4G-U;Congratulations on 3M my favourite tech reviewer♥️
7sExF5B4G-U;So many freaking smartphones !!!
7sExF5B4G-U; Just pick a random one and give it to me lol 😂 I'll gladly accept 😂
7sExF5B4G-U;Whew! That was breath taking! 👍👍👍 As usual, VG video content!
7sExF5B4G-U;Hmm I wonder at the rate Oneplus phones price keep rising if I can afford 8T next year :o I've owned 3T and currently owning 6T so it would only make sense to continue with it. Also the software is the best
7sExF5B4G-U;Love what you are reading on the lg g8 man😂😂😂
7sExF5B4G-U;OH I LOVE THAT GLITCH
7sExF5B4G-U;After watching this video, i need a sleep
7sExF5B4G-U;That editing...Good Lord what happened?
7sExF5B4G-U;Arun now u have 3million subs bro congratulations ✌️🎺
7sExF5B4G-U;10:34 who will spend that much of money to spy on streets 😂
7sExF5B4G-U;Where do I get the live wallpaper at 9:04?
7sExF5B4G-U;at like 6:05 the editing took a very weird turn! I thought I was in the twilight zone or something.
7sExF5B4G-U; I'm still surprised at how much hate the Pixel 4 gets from the tech community. Maybe I got lucky or something but, my Pixel 4 XL gets surprisingly good battery life. Right now I have 56% battery left and have been using it for 26 hrs so far with 2 1/2 hrs SOT. And Im sure I can get much more SOT and battery life from here depending on how I use it!  Battery life is such a subjective standard and no two people are going to have the same battery life. I can say this though if you use your device like normal ( calls, texts, web surfing, social media, etc) you will get insane battery life. But that can be said for any device that is optimized correctly.
7sExF5B4G-U;Messed up at 6:13
7sExF5B4G-U;Please give some of your phone hmmm :<
7sExF5B4G-U;0:15 Really you mean design..!!
7sExF5B4G-U;6:12 Dual audio video?
BlIBf26Cris; What do you think is the best phone of 2019? What phone are you most looking forward to in 2020? **
BlIBf26Cris;Top ten Smartphone to buy in 2020. 1st Samsung note 10+.
BlIBf26Cris;Me :- I though you were going to include phones i can afford 😭😂
BlIBf26Cris;Alternative title:
BlIBf26Cris;Phones your wallet can't afford.
BlIBf26Cris;"""to capture life's most beautiful moments"""
BlIBf26Cris;Make a list of best phones that kept the headphone jack
BlIBf26Cris;In five years there will be at least ten cameras on the back of a phone.
BlIBf26Cris;I want to get the OnePlus, I like how it's just a plain screen on the front.
BlIBf26Cris;It would be useful to display the make/model number on the screen all the time it's being discussed
BlIBf26Cris;I hope the OnePlus 7t Pro represents the original OnePlus 7 Pro :)
BlIBf26Cris;For me the OnePlus 7tpro is my favourite phone mostly cause of its light weight oxygen and the all screen display. I wouldn't mind the pop up selfie, I rarely take selfies 😂😂
BlIBf26Cris;I had the s9 plus when it came out then got the note 10 plus love it I'm done getting phones a new one come out to soon for me im good for now
BlIBf26Cris;I'm still rocking a phone from 2016. Just what I needed to see
BlIBf26Cris;My friend show me his new phone he pay 75£ monthly, i show him my harley dawidson sportster 48 i pay this same price. His face 😳
BlIBf26Cris;Ill let you know when i can afford one lol.
BlIBf26Cris;I love to see how Asus rog phone 2 matches with these flagships...
BlIBf26Cris;Xiaomi mi 9 lite is a really underrated budget smartphone
BlIBf26Cris;One Plus 7t Pro 5g McLaren 🦇 & i'm luving it 🔥
BlIBf26Cris;I feel like Apple phones are only ever included in these lists since 2017 to avoid dislikes from the Apple fanboys. They haven’t had a phone worth buying for a smart buyer in a long time and he was struggling to justify it in this video.
BlIBf26Cris;"""the mi mix 4 will have the 865 and 5G."" all phones with the 865 will have 5G, it's built into it."
BlIBf26Cris;08:30:00 AM
BlIBf26Cris;When father bought a phone for me and for my brother
BlIBf26Cris;I would definitely go for the OnePlus 7T pro or the Mate 30 pro... sadly still using a Huawei Nova 2i.. :'(
BlIBf26Cris;I love the Xperia line up. Is there anything new on the horizon for Sony Xperia?
BlIBf26Cris;I'm so happy imma be getting the Note 10+ 5G in a bit. Really looking forward to it.
BlIBf26Cris;I love this video, the tune, the style a fresh new take as a Daddy.
BlIBf26Cris;"""No compromises"".....missing headphone jack....alright"
BlIBf26Cris;They are all good products, but I'll really love to have the 0neplus 7t pro
BlIBf26Cris;"It's simple. I'll wait for a 5.7"" +/-.1 5G nm phone with wireless charging and no camera bump.  When I see that. I'll buy."
BlIBf26Cris;Where is rog phone 2, it's available in Europe for around 560
BlIBf26Cris;I'll get the McLaren plz. Thanks your the best!🤣
BlIBf26Cris;Wallpaper link pls?! Love those HD wallpapers. Thanks! ❤
BlIBf26Cris;"""It's only full HD"" - Most people still have HD TVs, and this is full HD compressed into a 6.5 inch screen. Can you see the pixels? No you can't. Also, when you go to a cinema, most digital cinema projectors are 2K (Full HD is 1920 horizontal pixels or 1.9K) and you are watching basically Full HD on a huge screen, and you still can't see the pixels... The resolution doesn't matter that much, it's all about static contrast, where black is completely black, not gray."
BlIBf26Cris;In the background I literal have the same tech AKA:vector and cololight
BlIBf26Cris;Wow, your way to make videos is amazing, it is really really interesting and so much fun to hear you talking, congratulations!
BlIBf26Cris;Of course the informations were very helpful :D
BlIBf26Cris;Simo, Italy :)
BlIBf26Cris;I'm turning 20 and I've never had a phone that I actually own 😅
BlIBf26Cris;I've been reading about Oppo releasing an updated version of the Find X. Just looking forward to see what has changed and if they will continue to use the sliding mechanism.
BlIBf26Cris;@ASBYT - looking forward to mid range and budget phones rising up as I was disappointed with top tier flag ship phones this year.
BlIBf26Cris;Nice review. Thank you.
BlIBf26Cris;Awesomely concise & more informative than other time wasters.........love from Pakistan 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
BlIBf26Cris;Love your presentation! And the detailed information too
BlIBf26Cris;Great video for the pinnacle of smart phones this year. For me the value and performance of the OnePlus 7 Pro was just too good to pass up with its recent price drop.
BlIBf26Cris;OnePlus 7t pro... Like the smooth experience of oxygen os and a lovely screen combined makes it my choice... Cameras as u said...doesn't make much diff for a normal user
BlIBf26Cris;Great video. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 4 looks incredible. I've also heard that Huawei may put a graphene battery in the P40 Pro. Now that would start a revolution in phone tech!
BlIBf26Cris;oneplus 7T pro best this year! looking forward for the next oneplus phone and I'm not even biased 😂👍
BlIBf26Cris;Got the on plus 6t, need that 7t pro McLaren. If only I would've known when I was younger, messing up my credit would make me pay full price for that phone😂
BlIBf26Cris;18:27 are those pictures real???
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung remains my favorite phone brand. But I see how Huawei is coming up too. The P30pro really looks good and attractive.
BlIBf26Cris;Does someone have a list of these?
BlIBf26Cris;I'm watching this video on my s10e which has already been updated to Android 10 9 days ago so I would suspect the Note 10 will follow suit before Christmas.
BlIBf26Cris;I thought its a video for phones that i can afford 🙅
BlIBf26Cris;Bro what about the Hauwie P30 pro 🤣 I've been waiting to see you say it 🤣
BlIBf26Cris;I can see me buying an 8T when that comes out. Apart from camera I'm very happy with my OP6
BlIBf26Cris;I want one plus McLaren edition please
BlIBf26Cris;But not available anywhere help me
BlIBf26Cris;Like your review Thank you keep them coming.👌👌Have you heard of any links about Google New Android 10 Streaming Box?? I just see a video on Triple M channel.
BlIBf26Cris;Xiaomi mi9 , mi9t pro best buy and one of the faster phones out there especially with good rom and kernel
BlIBf26Cris;What a nice video, loved that you mentioned realme and the mate 30 pro. Just subscribed!
BlIBf26Cris;I have ZTE R2 with Visible Mobile but would love the Xiaomi or the One Plus 8
BlIBf26Cris;A very crisp video with some comedy highlighting the real top of the line flagship phones. I fully agree with your selection, though in my country Pixel 4 has not been introduced. An insight to New Phones is appreciated.....Thanks.
BlIBf26Cris;Great review and excellent video production!
BlIBf26Cris;I still want that Samsung s10+ lol
BlIBf26Cris;Looking forward to e s11+ for sure. The note 10+ is dope. I love it
BlIBf26Cris;Got one plus 6t love it what shold I upgrade to 7t or wait till 8 or get 30pro
BlIBf26Cris;I just bought this phone yesterday and I miss this video...hahahahahahahahaa
BlIBf26Cris;Thanks for sharing... And Happy Birthday 🎉🥳
BlIBf26Cris;hmmm my first smartphone is iphone 5s and android galaxy edge 7
BlIBf26Cris;I'll just wait till no notch / holepunches and usb-c and hopefully not above 500
BlIBf26Cris;for my next upgrade.
BlIBf26Cris;Noooo! I like your old theme opening song
BlIBf26Cris;I love your presentation and expression about Smartphone reviews. Its really awesome♥️. Thank you💐
BlIBf26Cris;watch in speed × 1.25. Thank me in comments..😀😁
BlIBf26Cris;Looking forward to the Xiaomi Mi 10
BlIBf26Cris;how about best rugged phones for 2019-2020????
BlIBf26Cris;I have Samsung A20s right now. I wish note 10 plus next year so that i can use it in my studies.
BlIBf26Cris;#smartphone
BlIBf26Cris;#top5
BlIBf26Cris;#2020
BlIBf26Cris;If I want purchase one of these phone do you have sites where I can purchase at.

BlIBf26Cris;Bro love your videos, and the quality is top notch, please can u tell us what camera are you using and what lenses, and also if you use luts on your edidinting are you selling some lut packs, thanks mate
BlIBf26Cris;Thank you for introducing the best phone
BlIBf26Cris;I think at the moment Huawei does the nicest camera hump design.
BlIBf26Cris;On amazon I’ve bought phones but as you look in the reviews.
BlIBf26Cris;BECAREFUL.
BlIBf26Cris;Can you make a video for the best affordable smartphones for 2020? Like 350 or less?
BlIBf26Cris;Dude have you reviewed the Asus Rog 2?
BlIBf26Cris;Informative video but none of these would make me give up my Mate 20 Pro.
BlIBf26Cris;Yes, another video of phones i cant afford
BlIBf26Cris;I'm excited for the Xiaomi Mi Mix 4, I have the Mi Mix 3 and it's one of the best phones I've ever used, I just recently switched to the OnePlus 7 Pro and I love it to bits. Next year is gonna be rather interesting. I recently went from Apple to straight up Xiaomi. My wife has Samsung, and it's also a good phone. Right now my eyes are still on the OnePlus and it's gonna be like that in the space until then!
BlIBf26Cris;I need review about A 80
BlIBf26Cris;saving up for s20!
BlIBf26Cris;SHOUT OUT ON THE NEXT VID
BlIBf26Cris;ASBYT

BlIBf26Cris;I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR VIDEOS BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE.. LIKE AS I SAIN I BORROWED A PHONE
BlIBf26Cris;90hz is amazing. Seriously, a great experience.
BlIBf26Cris;"I'm new to your channel. Like your style and my favorite of that bunch gotta be the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren edition... Like you said ""it's a hell of phone""."
BlIBf26Cris;You are wrong! Samsung S10 got the Android 10 in Dec 2019 and it was already running Andorid 10 One UI 2 beta since Sept 2019
BlIBf26Cris;In my opinion, you deserve more subs than what you have now!
BlIBf26Cris;Christ I just bought the realme x2 pro, guess it's time to sell.  I will be getting the Mi 10 Pro that will be legendary.

BlIBf26Cris;Who saw the little robot in
BlIBf26Cris;03:45:00 AM
BlIBf26Cris;I just got the Huawei P30 Pro and I love it :)
BlIBf26Cris;This guy has the best reviews
BlIBf26Cris;0:12 My question isn't which smartphone is the best? But what do you do with all those latest phones? 😉😜
BlIBf26Cris;I like the 1plus 7 pro mclaren edition and the samsung note 10 plus like the comment if u like one of those phones
BlIBf26Cris;I'm a new OnePlus customer. I've had my 7 pro since just around the time the 7t came out, I didn't want the camera notch, the slightly faster charging wasn't enough for me, the 855+ processer is barely any faster than the standard 855, the pop up camera is fun to use even if not a fan of selfies..and my hands are somewhat large, so I enjoy the size. I love this phone and can't wait to see what else OnePlus has in store for us 😍
BlIBf26Cris;These are late 2919 phones
BlIBf26Cris;Ass Bite - AS-BYT 😂
BlIBf26Cris; Happy New Year!
BlIBf26Cris;Ridonculous! 😂
BlIBf26Cris;It is not 2020 yet! What are you gonna recommend in early 2020? 😅
BlIBf26Cris;I got android 10 for my note 10 on January 1st at like 2am I was so happy I downloaded it at the bar lol. That was Samsung's happy new year gift
BlIBf26Cris;Write the list in the description
BlIBf26Cris;Since about a week before you put out this video my Damsung Galaxy S10+ is sporting Android 10. I wonder if what you say about the Note 10 is accurate (can't verify, I don't have that one)
BlIBf26Cris;Eagerly waiting for the Xiaomi Redmi K30 Pro!
BlIBf26Cris;where is asus rog phone 2?
BlIBf26Cris;I’ve decided to turn to Xiaomi to aid me in switching away from IPhone which I’ve had for about the past 10 years. Their price/product factor seems pretty solid and I finally want a new phone I don’t have to spend an arm and a leg for. Mi 9 lite for the win!
BlIBf26Cris;Realme x2 pro is on my list I might switch it with my iPhone 6 when i turn 16 this year and when I get a job and save my money and ya let’s hope I get it.
BlIBf26Cris;Best low price Snapdragon 855 is Xiaomi K20 Pro =Mi 9T Pro - 8GB-  256 amazing smart Phone 420€ 👈👍
BlIBf26Cris;To be honest I wanted new mobile but I am going to wait for Samsung Galaxy S11 🤷‍♂️
BlIBf26Cris;Happy birthday 🎂
BlIBf26Cris;Great video!
BlIBf26Cris;I'm 28 and can't afford nun of these phone 😩🤧🤣🤣

BlIBf26Cris;Xperia 1 displays the best at the minute that phones so underrated !
BlIBf26Cris;after so long time even trump couldnt find the security fault on huawei, you found it.
BlIBf26Cris;Great idea for a video and timing as well. After purposely dodging black friday & cyber Monday deals I was wondering if now was still a good time to grab myself a oneplus 7t pro or if I should wait. I still am not sure but I did want to see some 2020 phones so thank you!
BlIBf26Cris;I got a LG V50 for $200
BlIBf26Cris;What smartphone can beat this?
BlIBf26Cris;My dream phone iphone 11 pro max and ROG 2
BlIBf26Cris;Hello, I love your video! I am a new follower! I was wondering if you could put the name of the phone you're discussing in small font somewhere on the screen. That way, people that are less involved in the technology world, like me, can keep up with which phone is which! I found myself going back in the video a couple times for a reminder as to what phone was being discussed! Just an idea! Thank you for all the information!
BlIBf26Cris;Hi! Awesome video...also, can you tell me what game you're playing at 5:10? Looks cool👌🏾
BlIBf26Cris;I love your review go head
BlIBf26Cris;I thought the name was pronounced Assbite lol
BlIBf26Cris;Got Android 10 yesterday on my Snapdragon S10 plus.
BlIBf26Cris;I just picked up a Note 9 refurbished on Amazon for $370, seriously great phone for the money

BlIBf26Cris;Give away? Any of the top 5 can do. Pretty please.
BlIBf26Cris;I hope Oneplus make a folding tablet in a few years that has the size of a regular phone in folded form, then folds out to a nice tablet with a stylus. Want to get my digital painting jam on :)

BlIBf26Cris;I wonder when Huawei p 40 well be available with our carriers here in Canada and hopefully with Google

BlIBf26Cris;I am currently using the OnePlus 7t and I'm obviously waiting for the next one to come. The 8 ,8pro or 8 lite. And that will be the phone to go!!😇😇

BlIBf26Cris;where’s the redmi note 8 pro
BlIBf26Cris;looking forward to the pocophone f2
BlIBf26Cris;I love the one plus series so for me the best phone for 2019 is OnePlus 7T Pro and the best upcoming would be OnePlus 8 series definitely.
BlIBf26Cris;You are a Deezer user? Huh 😊
BlIBf26Cris;I miss the old flip phones.
BlIBf26Cris;Here I am trying to buy a phone for less than $500 and this one is only recommending $1000+ phones.
BlIBf26Cris;But I'm gonna go get the ASUS Zenfone 6.
BlIBf26Cris;Everything expensive is always good!
BlIBf26Cris;Do one for smartphones under USD 300.
BlIBf26Cris;I hope to see zenfone 7 with amoled screen and 90hz screen and improved camera. Love that you can use the main sensor for selfies and video
BlIBf26Cris;Love my iPhone 11 pro max
BlIBf26Cris;What's the name of game you was playing on OnePlus 7 pro please ??
BlIBf26Cris;壟✌🏼
BlIBf26Cris;You need to see the doctor bro.
BlIBf26Cris;Pound for pound Realme provide the best hardware. The software Colour Os is like Marmite.
BlIBf26Cris;I have Huawei P20 Pro and would really like to have Huawei Mate 20 X 5G. Just because of the huge 7,2” display.
BlIBf26Cris;I want a MiMix 4!
BlIBf26Cris;IPHONE XS IS THE BEST OKKKKKKKK?
BlIBf26Cris;and the ROG phone 2?
BlIBf26Cris;Rocking lg v50 at the moment.
BlIBf26Cris;"I have an iPhone XR for nearly a year now. I really like the new iPhones and also looked into the OnePlus and the Samsung lineup.  I literally had them in my online store basket at one time or another and all I had to do is push ""purchase"" and I didn't, LOL!  "
BlIBf26Cris; iPhone 11 Pro is too expensive and the iPhone 11- I would literally paying $700 for a wide angle camera added to my current phone, that's just the way I look at it. I used to be a Samsung Note person a few years back, but I just couldn't keep up with their pricing anymore.
BlIBf26Cris;Chose the Pixel 3a a couple weeks ago. Great so far.
BlIBf26Cris;12GB RAM? Most people have computers with less RAM
BlIBf26Cris;I would buy xiaomi redmi k30 6ram and 128g
BlIBf26Cris;what was the game you were playing on one plus 7 pro in the video.
BlIBf26Cris;"Take a shot of whiskey every time he says ""BAT,TREE"""
BlIBf26Cris;Being a note 10 plus 5g user. This is the phone to go for 👌👌👌👌
BlIBf26Cris;Waiting for p40 pro
BlIBf26Cris;Where's Asus Rog phone 2?
BlIBf26Cris;I bought the Note 10+ after holding off upgrading my Note 5 for the longest time. I must say, well worth the price.
BlIBf26Cris;WHAT HAPPENED TO OPPO Reno 2
BlIBf26Cris;Google 4xl for me the best camera of all
BlIBf26Cris;For Android samsung
BlIBf26Cris;For apple iphone 11
BlIBf26Cris;Note 11,s11 and mix 4 i m waiting for
BlIBf26Cris;Mate 30 Pro😍😍😍
BlIBf26Cris;THE BEST NOKIA 3310
BlIBf26Cris;Can i get shoutout pls
BlIBf26Cris; Your the best absyt
BlIBf26Cris;"Where is the ""Porsche Taycan"" version of the OnePlus???"
BlIBf26Cris;I think that's the fairest review of the pixel your going to get. I think other than wide angle, battery is a huge issue. I think that's the main thing putting me off.
BlIBf26Cris;tnx
BlIBf26Cris;Microsoft Surface Duo?
BlIBf26Cris;Great vid, I like the OnePlus McLaren.
BlIBf26Cris;So what's the phones he mentioned? I'm not watching a 20 minute video to find out.
BlIBf26Cris;Got the poco F1 and am dying for the f2 but if I had  the money
BlIBf26Cris;I'd have the mi mix 4
BlIBf26Cris;The K30 pro has already launched in India under the name POCO X2

BlIBf26Cris;Nothing still beats my 1year old huawei mate 20 X. 😂😂😂
BlIBf26Cris;7.2inch screen.. 5k mah battery.. dual speakers.. and an M.pen.. still the beast in 2020.. 👍👍
BlIBf26Cris;Yes. I. Like. I. Phone. And. Smart. Phone. Together. Work. With. Each. Others. Joint. Technology. In. The. Future. And. Win. Win. In. Both. Countries. Yes. Let. S. Go. Go. Go. And. Works. Together. My. All. Friends.
BlIBf26Cris;You mentioned every big release phone brother.
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung A70 is legit.loving that midrange phone.
BlIBf26Cris;McLaren all the way!
BlIBf26Cris;What are ur thoughts on the newest Sony Experia phones? I love the these phones. I hear the Zero will have much higher Ram & Storage?
BlIBf26Cris;Oneplus 7 McLaren Edition is my favorite !
BlIBf26Cris;I have the iPhone 11 now, I’m lovin it
BlIBf26Cris;What is the name of the game at 5:10, looks sick!
BlIBf26Cris;Behind screen camera = I buy it!
BlIBf26Cris;Never thought I would become an Apple sheep lol, but I just have. Just moved from a Huawei P30 Pro to the iPhone 11 Pro to work along side my iPad Pro I just purchased. For all my needs as a budding YouTuber on the go ( Luma Fusion)and being a prosthetic make up artist that needs great design programs ( procreate etc, Affinity Photo) I felt I had to become immersed in that eco system. The money has been well spent and I know I can always trade in with Apple for the next upgrade I get
BlIBf26Cris;Sooo all the one plus it s have snap dragon?
BlIBf26Cris;Idk why but his face reminds me of Derek Hale from Teen Wolf xd
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung fold is very good phon 😍😍😍 my favorite phon 😘
BlIBf26Cris;I just bought the Razer phone 2 very good graphics run any game smooth asf but unfortunately mines defective and turns off on it's own...
BlIBf26Cris;Lol Just bought the a50
BlIBf26Cris;Still pondering over the pixel 4xl, iPhone 11 max pro or wait till the Samsung 11 comes out.
BlIBf26Cris;Decisions decisions
BlIBf26Cris;"""The pinnacle of android, no compromises"""
BlIBf26Cris;ASBYT: they didn't increase the refresh rates
BlIBf26Cris;ASBYT: Camera is not the best in every situation
BlIBf26Cris;ASBYT: UI* late software
BlIBf26Cris;I have OnePlus 7 pro and easily the best with the 90hz screen and oxygen os
BlIBf26Cris;s11+ too almost here guys
BlIBf26Cris;so? what are the TOP, BEST, MOST AWESOME,  5 phones? 1..., 2. ..., 3. ... comme on! don't keep it to yourself!
BlIBf26Cris;"With a few exceptions, it's almost always ""worth waiting"" for the latest greatest to come down in price  a bit. There also comes a time to make that choice and get a phone! Especially if you don't have a back up on hand, without a phone and the 2 verizon prepaid phone you bought and had to return  because verizon  themselves  couldn't get the phones to work?! Even took it into a Corp store front! Soooooo time to pick and order a phone. My choice a New unopened LG G7 for 249 us ...I loved my G2, it broke (my fault),  I got a 3 and then a 4 and they where UTTER disappointments. I swore off LG until now feeling like a brand new G7 which has great ""long term"" reviews as a great phone  and for 250 shipped I just did it! Should be here soon! Life BETTER BE Good! This time!!!"
BlIBf26Cris; NICE VIDEO! 🙈
BlIBf26Cris;3 of my heavy used daily phones 1. iPhone 11 pro max 256gb space grey iOS simple gets the job done 2. Samsung note 10 plus 512gb aura glow power Beast 3. Pixel 3 xl 128gb just black stock android
BlIBf26Cris;"The video needs a like just for the pun ""killer flagship"""
BlIBf26Cris;No LG v60 hype???
BlIBf26Cris;1:11 which phone is that?
BlIBf26Cris;no lg love?
BlIBf26Cris;Nice job... I think the regular Oneplus 7pro  is the one to buy over McLaren edition as you save quite a bit of money and you only lose some RAM and maybe it has the 855 instead of the 855+ it’s a better buy
BlIBf26Cris;Happy with my Note 10+😍
BlIBf26Cris;"Great (and less ""visible"") contenders for 2020: LG G9, Meizu 17, but also Galaxy Fold 2"
BlIBf26Cris;Which game is he currently playing at 5:22
BlIBf26Cris;Please pixel listen to this guy
BlIBf26Cris;Did he say note 10 plus has 90hz display?
BlIBf26Cris;Note 10+ Dark side!!!
BlIBf26Cris;Asus zenfone 6 deserved a mention or top placement. 5000m battery, fast processor, best price among these choices.
BlIBf26Cris;Android 10 stable version already came out for Note 10
BlIBf26Cris;Android 10 stable version already came out for Note 10
BlIBf26Cris;Great video, but you may be wrong about the note getting android 10. My S10+ got android 10 last week.  Can't wait for the S11+. Happy  bday m8
BlIBf26Cris;Note 10+ is love🥰
BlIBf26Cris;Wich phone beats a unlocked note 8 quality at a lower cost o.o?
BlIBf26Cris;What game was that with samurai?
BlIBf26Cris;ROG Phone 2 ??
BlIBf26Cris;Xiaomi not going to produce poco anymore?
BlIBf26Cris;Daddyyy can you kiss me 😘
BlIBf26Cris;you dont know where your infomation will go when using huawei? so you know it when you use iphone?
BlIBf26Cris;1 4 m3 please
BlIBf26Cris;Super Love u brother
BlIBf26Cris;What about the new concept phone vivo Apex 2020 which is being closely compared to the Mi Mix 4 now.
BlIBf26Cris;I used all the top phones, but when I got my hands on the Mate 30 Pro, everything changed. It is simply the best.
BlIBf26Cris;Pixel 4a is the one I'm waiting for
BlIBf26Cris;I've OnePlus 7pro and sometimes i feel, i should have gone for samsung note 10. But that been said, one plus 7pro is sufficient for me..
BlIBf26Cris;Missed the best of all. Mate 20x.
BlIBf26Cris;Panghatag og cellphone bi? Daghan man kaayo kag cellphone oy. Ipanghatag pud nang uban. Dili man ko ka afford ana gud. May man ka kay kwartahan daghan og nindot nga cellphone.
BlIBf26Cris;#smartphone
BlIBf26Cris;#top5
BlIBf26Cris;"It's interesting, I have a Pixel 1, and since I got it, I just haven't seen a phone worth the upgrade. My main concern is the camera quality, but making that huge payment for a new phone just hasn't seem worth it yet, with any of the releases. I'm also not a fan of +6"" phones so the selection is also a bit more narrow I guess."
BlIBf26Cris;Come on...Apple never made real Flagships....
BlIBf26Cris;Pixel 3a?
BlIBf26Cris;What is the sword fighting game he plays on the Oneplus 7t Pro Mclaren?
BlIBf26Cris;To me the ultimate mobile platform bed is where you can upgrade everything, from memory, battery, software, screen, etc., by sliding out old wares and sliding in whatever upgrade you want to enhance the performance of your phone. No need to buy another unit but only the parts you want to upgrade.
BlIBf26Cris;Top 10 best budget phones?
BlIBf26Cris;Got a iPhone 8 at the min but want to go android. Think the one + looks awesome.
BlIBf26Cris;redmi note 8 pro 230 euro bargain!
BlIBf26Cris;Where is Asus ROG 2
BlIBf26Cris;Call me old school but a camera is for pictures a phone is for talking. We use the phones like a multitasking powerhouse but a clear voice of someone I love is my best selling point.
BlIBf26Cris;Got GCam working on my note 10+ and pixel who?
BlIBf26Cris;Do they get 5g network? 4k quality on all cameras?
BlIBf26Cris;Wow
BlIBf26Cris;Can anybody talk about lg here! Except for laaate  software update, everything is great. You even have a damn hifi quad dac!
BlIBf26Cris;2k19 best smart phone 1
BlIBf26Cris;Huwaei met 30pro
BlIBf26Cris;"What about ""Budget Phones to buy in early 2020"""
BlIBf26Cris;You have 30,000 emails.  Please God, check them.
BlIBf26Cris;My carrier just had a flash sale on the S10 series and I picked one up for $575 CAD ($430 USD)
BlIBf26Cris;NO5g
BlIBf26Cris;There's no best smart phone only one that's must suitable to you and then your opinion say this the best smart phone
BlIBf26Cris;Galaxy note 10 already released Android 10
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung is not S11. But S20
BlIBf26Cris;What phone is at 1:14 ?
BlIBf26Cris;ASBYT stands for what?
BlIBf26Cris;No! Xiaomi! You had it right with the pop-up selfie camera! Don't do the punch out camera! Ugh. Why you do this?
BlIBf26Cris;The best in 2019 is the note 10 plus
BlIBf26Cris;Just buy an iphone xr, its fast enough and its also cheaper
BlIBf26Cris;I have a Honor Play. Don't know what I want yet
BlIBf26Cris;I hope the OPPO a9 will be good
BlIBf26Cris;I'm using a nokia 5.1 plus now I'm thinking a refurbished iPhone x, if i have the funds, what do you think #ASBYT
BlIBf26Cris;Realme X2 Pro. Half the price of the One Plus and still uses the same processor and screen for half price
BlIBf26Cris;yes when money is no object/
BlIBf26Cris;I am going to buy OnePlus 7t because it is the only flagship under my budget and I am also a big fan of oneplus
BlIBf26Cris;S11 series 👍
BlIBf26Cris;Android 10 came out before this video came out 🤔🤔
BlIBf26Cris;got my note 10+ for 500 on black friday, cant beat it, best phone out at the tie
BlIBf26Cris;Xiaomi mi 10 pro shortly released seems the most sexy for budget users.
BlIBf26Cris;Man that lisp
BlIBf26Cris;why do you remind me of noel gallagher
BlIBf26Cris;16:16 No, no, no, no, no!!! Why are they going BACKWARDS from the popup camera?! I’d be fine with a punch hole on the 8, but if the 8 pro doesn’t have a popup camera, I’m gonna be mad. I hope they ditch that curved screen at least...
BlIBf26Cris;Just bought one plus 7t pro mclaren edition today only 😊
BlIBf26Cris;What phone for a girlfriend?
BlIBf26Cris;Oneplus 8
BlIBf26Cris;Good video, but stop with those lame jokes
BlIBf26Cris;Thnx bro
BlIBf26Cris;You guys got it easy when you could get these smartphones under $1000. In my country, it would cost 4000+-. Our basic salary is around 3000 per month. Some people get less than 1000 per month. Fvck this country. Only minister have big salary.

BlIBf26Cris;Way too long of a videoZ
BlIBf26Cris;Rog phone 2
BlIBf26Cris;Hahaa compare to my galaxy on hahaahahah.....my god the technology
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung should start thinking about their price. Except One UI, they have nothing better than Huawei and One Plus. But the price is too high to go for.
BlIBf26Cris;can i have the Samsung note 10 + pls?
BlIBf26Cris;I swear I’m an apple lover but damn I’m switching to android because apple sucks! I’m a manga read and anime watcher so I’m pissed off if I cannot download them on my iphone and besides apple’s payment method sucks!!!
BlIBf26Cris;Good phones
BlIBf26Cris;What about the razer phone 2?
BlIBf26Cris;OnePlus 7 Pro is the best phone of 2019!!
BlIBf26Cris;Insert Sammy and iFruit fanboy complaints here--->
BlIBf26Cris;Oh yeah  because surely sending all our information to Google is good thing right?
BlIBf26Cris;Mi 10 will be the one of the first 2020 phone to use the brand new Snapdragon 865 chips...its a flagship from Xiaomi...but i wonder why its not in your list... 👎
BlIBf26Cris;My Samsung S4 still the best for 2020 coz all these smart phones are confusing me .🤣😀🤣🤣😀🤣😀🤣😀😀🤣

BlIBf26Cris;Regular Apple  11
BlIBf26Cris;Mate 30 Pro
BlIBf26Cris;ive been drinking but too much hair an movement
BlIBf26Cris;In my opinion, Best phone of 2019 is Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and Oneplus 7T pro Mclaren Edition. They are really beast overall..  Rather,  i'm not a fan of so called coconut Apple. 😂🤣
BlIBf26Cris;Xiaomi Redmi K20 is called Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro in the UK
BlIBf26Cris;Is there a big difrence between the oneplus 7t pro and the 7t pro mc edicion?... Do you think its worth it?

BlIBf26Cris;i want iPhone or samsung phone 😻
BlIBf26Cris;I'm still rocking an LG G6 because it can still record phone calls
BlIBf26Cris;For me the best beast smart phone this year is the realme x2pro because of it's price and it's specs.
BlIBf26Cris;
BlIBf26Cris;Hope I win one of your giveaways🙏👏🏽
BlIBf26Cris;God bless and more blessings to come.😇

BlIBf26Cris;One plus 8 McLaren.... If or when it comes out is the phone to get in 2020.
BlIBf26Cris;Pick mate 30 pro, you wont regret it
BlIBf26Cris;If you was a decent reviewer you would know that this year note 10 plus is gonna get stable android 10 and for the last few months it's had security updates before the pixel and OnePlus
BlIBf26Cris;You should really list the phone models and links in the description to make things easier for your audience to go find the phones when done watching.

BlIBf26Cris;Great video, and you are a genius in verbal conundrum!
BlIBf26Cris;😁😁👍👍👍
BlIBf26Cris;whats the name of the game u re playing in this video
BlIBf26Cris;Wrong about the software update. UI 2.0 is rocking on
BlIBf26Cris;Mi 9T pro idc still the best
BlIBf26Cris;@15:22 Nope, I'd rather get the Realme X50. It supposedly comes with 90Hz Super Amoled, a larger battery, SD 765 and VOOC 4.0 but it comes with the catch of early adopter 5G attached to it. I'd call it 5G tax. It means less features or significantly higher prices.
BlIBf26Cris;No wireless charging for just under $1,000 U.S. you gotta be kidding! No way!
BlIBf26Cris;huawei mate x????
BlIBf26Cris;I've my peepers on a couple of potential new daily driver's for 2020,... Trouble is I'm finding it hard to replace my honour play as it's soooo bloody good for what it cost me!! Hahahaha... I'm just going to have to accidently break it! 🙈😂
BlIBf26Cris;I wanna know if Samsung's Note series is gonna live to make a Note 11 in the future or discontinue it...I really hope they keep it alive in another series
BlIBf26Cris;If only the Mate 30 Pro had GMS...
BlIBf26Cris;Next year there is wide angle lens in pixel, but everybidy else is going already to zoom like huawei or something else😂😂
BlIBf26Cris;stfu with ur intros. next.
BlIBf26Cris;I have a OnePlus 7 Pro now and I wouldn't want to trade it with any other phone anymore.
BlIBf26Cris;All your testing and comparing you all forget to test the MAIN Use of any phone. How well it receives a good signal in weak signal areas.
BlIBf26Cris;There can be a  noticable difference between brands and models, and the more expensive phones are often not so good in this area.
BlIBf26Cris;Did he really just forgot asus rog 2 120 hz oled display 855+ plus processor 8 gb Ram 128 gb rom liquid cooling system clean ui both for stock Android and gaming lover in just 550 dollars wierd 🙄
BlIBf26Cris;https://youtu.be/7eRlU7cQS04
BlIBf26Cris;Think I got the best phone for battery life I got the iPhone 11 Pro Max and honestly I’ve never seen battery life like it .
BlIBf26Cris;Naah il just go with redmi note8 pro
BlIBf26Cris;Wow let me win
BlIBf26Cris;What do you think the best cheap contract phone is
BlIBf26Cris;I have the OnePlus 7t Pro.. it's pretty good, probably not as good as Note 10+ but OnePlus gives you major bang for the buck in a flagship.  Android 10 too right out of the gate.
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei mate 10 jumia kenya price
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung 🤮
BlIBf26Cris;A70 all day baby 🙅
BlIBf26Cris;HUAWEI mate 30 pro ！
BlIBf26Cris;Can you start doing a us version. It's so hard to find YouTubers who do US phones
BlIBf26Cris;The only reason I want the spen is not for taking notes and pictures etc.. I want it for drawing
BlIBf26Cris;https://youtu.be/XgRT7sZQuXo
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung gets slow in years
BlIBf26Cris;Looking to to replace my S7 active (Ikr) and sick of over priced phones that cost more than my monthly car pmt. Any recommendations for a phone thats decent quality, will last a while, and fits a $200 or less budget?
BlIBf26Cris;Those mi mix 4 photos are fake. Confirmed by iceuniverse
BlIBf26Cris;1:37 to 1:38 Are you sure? RIP the headphone jack. Except that, it is a fabulous smartphone!
BlIBf26Cris;Asus zenphone max pro 7
BlIBf26Cris;Mate 30 pro
BlIBf26Cris;Thanks British Tom cruise.
BlIBf26Cris;Huawxx sucks tq, no objections~🙃
BlIBf26Cris;Ew
BlIBf26Cris;01:37:00 AM
BlIBf26Cris;Headphone jack: Am I a joke to you?
BlIBf26Cris;Right, Iphone has the best video recording on a phone in the world he says. lol, funny
BlIBf26Cris;Whats the wallpaper on the note? In 2:00. With the mountains. Where can i get it? 😊
BlIBf26Cris;personally i  would not give any iphone  house room  the security on them just suck
BlIBf26Cris;I like huawei
BlIBf26Cris;I'll go for Samsung Galaxy A71
BlIBf26Cris;Do best phones under £300
BlIBf26Cris;EVERY 3 MONTH NEW MODEL ..................LOL
BlIBf26Cris;I think there are going to be more phones with pop up selfie cameras in 2020.
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung Galaxy S10.
BlIBf26Cris;Good night. I have the Samsung a10 and the umidigi a3 pro, I would have to get the Samsung note 10
BlIBf26Cris;EMERGENCY PROBLEMS with SAMSUNG NOTE 10+. I've had the note 10+ since Aug 2019. I'm a developer with 30yrs experience. The 10+ and all the other phones Samsung has put out with android op 10 have many defects they haven't fixed that I've reported to developers. 1. Biometric fingerprint causes screen to flash. Can't access apps.
BlIBf26Cris;One plus is good phon
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei's the industry leading notch
BlIBf26Cris;What is One Plus all about
BlIBf26Cris;Looking 👀 forward to some new folding phones particular the new Razr design hopefully Samsung will follow that form factor.
BlIBf26Cris;My family all switched to Huawei Y9 or Y9 Prime. They both have Google apps and all working fine. I'm not a camera person. I'm more of a battery and RAM power player, and I'm holding out for a mid-range 5G phone.
BlIBf26Cris;A
BlIBf26Cris;Hi Asbyt ..do u gift me a 2nd hand cellphone,i can't afford to buy cellphone,..pls.
BlIBf26Cris;I like this video
BlIBf26Cris;9:38 anti higher then 1080p
BlIBf26Cris;Can't wait for the P40 pro
BlIBf26Cris;Wow
BlIBf26Cris;I can tell you this. The OnePlus 7 pro is way!!!!!! Overhyped. Yes it's cool when it's working. But you can definitely tell it's Chinese. It has all kinds of problems.
BlIBf26Cris;Ah yes. The sight of a horse's nostrils. One of life's most beautiful moments
BlIBf26Cris;your accent resembles with the people I talk on the phone while I'm at work because I work for virgin media call center in India 😅
BlIBf26Cris;P30 pro
BlIBf26Cris;xiaomi mi note 10
BlIBf26Cris;I recommend the OnePlus 7t,I use a xiaomi mi a1 and I like the software but the performance is so bad...
BlIBf26Cris;all expensive
BlIBf26Cris;Did you notice a warning or something in his monitor at background?
BlIBf26Cris;Well if you did, You are a real genius.
BlIBf26Cris;I knew note 10+ is the power house
BlIBf26Cris;Note 10, no compromise? No headphone jack is a BIG deal breaking compromise!
BlIBf26Cris;All chinese phones like Xiaomi, Oppo, Realme, OnePlus doesn't has IP68 rating. So I skip them all. I'm using Note 10 Plus. So damn beatuful and my fav phone 2019.
BlIBf26Cris;What game was that? I
BlIBf26Cris;Note 10 plus
BlIBf26Cris;Rog phone 2????
BlIBf26Cris;Nice
BlIBf26Cris;What about the give away,did I miss it?
BlIBf26Cris;I think no compromises isn't just for the note 10 plus. You address it early with refresh rate but I think that is lacking vs everyone it's competing against
BlIBf26Cris;The cellphone is officially dead! Another camera upgrade.....that's all. My 3+ year old phone is staying put!
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung galaxy s10 plus
BlIBf26Cris;My frugal sensibilities (and my wallet!) suggest that I be very interested in the Realme brand...
BlIBf26Cris;Mate 30 pro ? Rly ? It doesn't even have Google support
BlIBf26Cris;flagship apple 11 best photography but google need to be fixed cost too high
BlIBf26Cris;My iPhone 11 Pro camera has been crashing everyday and Apple can’t fix it 😰
BlIBf26Cris;🔥🔥
BlIBf26Cris; 1:43 💖💕
BlIBf26Cris;  👇👇👇💖
BlIBf26Cris;I have the note 10 pluss I must say it's the most beautiful phone iv ever used large punchy display ..good battery life ..fast ..the camera on the front after while you forget it's even there ..and also being hdr pluss cerfied really brings movies to life ..1 big disappointment for me tho was the headphone jack but the fact that they give you headphones in the box makes up for that ..some people disagree and dont like the spen but it can be useful for instance when signing a document that just cant be done on any other phone..if you think about it it just gives you absolutely every feature packed into a device even the small features you may not find important can be important when you really need them the most ..drawback aswell must be the price.
BlIBf26Cris;Oneplus 7 pro.
BlIBf26Cris;No compromises: No headphone jack 😒
BlIBf26Cris;Your video sucks it had absolutely no information the first two minutes about cell phones get to the point this is YouTube
BlIBf26Cris;Wow. All. The. Smart. Phone. Is. Best. I. Chew.chin.hock..like. all.
BlIBf26Cris;Which has best antenna?
BlIBf26Cris;https://www.span.com/product/Samsung-SSD-PM1733-OEM-MZWLJ15THALA-00007-2-5-U-2-NVMe-15-36TB-SSD~70808
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung a71 is good
BlIBf26Cris;thats the best chesp smart phone whats the best chesp tablet u can buy
BlIBf26Cris;Shirt link please? *Which he wearing in this black one*
BlIBf26Cris;😯😯🥰🥰🥰😋😋😋
BlIBf26Cris;Note 10 lite
BlIBf26Cris;Pixel can use more base storage also to match other flagships
BlIBf26Cris;Snapdragon 855 Is outdated and sluggish compared to the ip11 Bionic. Heck even the 865 trails the Bionic. When will SD make a CPU that can match Apple?
BlIBf26Cris;Why is there not a single news about note 11 or 11+?
BlIBf26Cris;Can you do a video about top 5 phones without notches please 💕💕
BlIBf26Cris;What about honor 20?
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei user here ❤️❤️ nothing can beat huawei 💛
BlIBf26Cris;Team iPhone 11
BlIBf26Cris;Os is the main reason to choose the phone
BlIBf26Cris;My choice is Samsung
BlIBf26Cris;what do you think about BlackView?
BlIBf26Cris;I think oneplus devices is the best due to what u get for what u buy
BlIBf26Cris;iPhone 11 is a beast and will last more that any other
BlIBf26Cris;Apple basically has no wins here as if you are a professional videographer or photographer you wouldn’t be using a phone anyway. Apple really did go to the shitter after Steve jobs passing away.
BlIBf26Cris;I see The Fifth Stand.... A fellow Chelsea fan mate??
BlIBf26Cris;Extremely disappointed in the direction Samsung is going by removing the headphone jack. What are they thinking???
BlIBf26Cris;Note 10+ now has Android 10 across the board.
BlIBf26Cris;I can assure you that at least for the Samsung galaxy s 10+ the upgrade for android 10 was given a week ago from the time i posted this comment
BlIBf26Cris;One Plus 7 Pro is the way to go
BlIBf26Cris;you dont have the expireans ..about this work you better leaved...because mate 30 pro better one plus and iphone👍
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei Rox
BlIBf26Cris;Note10+
BlIBf26Cris;The mate 30 pro has a 90hz refresh rate screen
BlIBf26Cris;oneplus 7 pro here.. just get it. so you guys won't get confuse with all these phones 😂
BlIBf26Cris;iPhone 11 Pro Max best
BlIBf26Cris;I love that Samsung finally offered a smaller Note phone. Not everyone has large hands. But it was disappointing that there was no SD card slot on the smaller Note 10 version.
BlIBf26Cris;I have the Samsung Galaxy S10+ , I have the GCam app and Android 10 .  I like this phone because it has the headphone jack and expandable memory also I don't need the pen. Battery life is great and I play lots of games especially Call of Duty and it never lags.
BlIBf26Cris;Roise in proice mate
BlIBf26Cris;The best seems to be the Redmi Note8 plus.... for 198.- Pounds... because you bin your phone the next year anyway.
BlIBf26Cris;android one phone if you dont have a lot of money
BlIBf26Cris;I am big fan you
BlIBf26Cris;Smawt phones woould 😂🤣
BlIBf26Cris;"You say Note 10 as a ""no compromise phone!?"" What are no headphone jack and Hole punch screen??"
BlIBf26Cris;Ram, camera king,  battery life,  fast charger & fix price that's why Huawei mate 30&30 pro 5g is better than others.
BlIBf26Cris;Yeah for a company like Google uld think they wld gt it....so disappointing
BlIBf26Cris;"Way too big, we need under 5"" smartphones again."
BlIBf26Cris;Bad reviewer
BlIBf26Cris;When arrive smartphone that have option to add ram rom all manually build
BlIBf26Cris;Just upgraded to the Apple 11 Pro Max.  I really wanted to get the note but I’m stuck in the Apple ecosystem.  iMessage is the best experience.  #sorrynotsorry
BlIBf26Cris;What a bland video with 0 opinions differing from the norms
BlIBf26Cris;Is mi k30 is best one to buy ??
BlIBf26Cris;One plus are great phones but I'm tired of them after having 3 of them over last few yrs and looking for change...I'm definitely interested in the Realme x2 pro but I have two questions...I'm in USA so where is Best place to buy it online and will it be fully compatible with tmobiles 4g lte?...
BlIBf26Cris;Mate seriously, you recommend the Huawei even though it's not able to run Google apps? Did their marketing team drop you an unofficial line to do this lol? Don't take the money man it only screws you in the long run. Lol
BlIBf26Cris;flagship killer and killer flagship!
BlIBf26Cris;These phones are cheaper than iPhones
BlIBf26Cris;Thank god, i thought only Indians do phone review's
BlIBf26Cris;pls could u help me do decide with phone should i buy oneplus 7tpro or iPhone 11
BlIBf26Cris;What's your opinion on the LG G8X Thin Q?
BlIBf26Cris;Hit like for oneplus 7t pro 5g mclaren
BlIBf26Cris;A top 5 without the the Apple 11pm ?   Not possible.  That’s just pure fantasy
BlIBf26Cris;MiA3- fab phone for £130
BlIBf26Cris;I'm good with my S9
BlIBf26Cris;iPhone 12 no, that tiny screen is useless
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei mate30 no, massive software issues
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung note 10 is great...though behind the best all-rounder of the year #oneplus7t series, the pro model is even more delicate than the normal, that is a bit unsolid, only problems are memory, brightness and battery, in that order of severity
BlIBf26Cris;Here's the list:
BlIBf26Cris;1. Note 10+
BlIBf26Cris;2. One plus 70 Pro  4:16
BlIBf26Cris;3. IPhone 11             6:39
BlIBf26Cris;Killer Flagships 🤣😂🤣🤣   im getting that oneplus7pro 😎👍
BlIBf26Cris;OnePlus 7 Pro of course.
BlIBf26Cris;I say Moto g7 pixel 3a Galaxy S10 iPhone 11 and maybe LG V50
BlIBf26Cris;Do you wear wig
BlIBf26Cris;https://youtu.be/TW2-Y-EPA5E
BlIBf26Cris;I use the iPhone XR and love it. I got it when it was first released though. I also have a Sony Xperia XZ3 as a back up phone which isn't bad either.
BlIBf26Cris;Haha. No1 vouching for Apple on this thread.
BlIBf26Cris;I have the iPhone 11 and coming from the Xs Max, I’m more than happy. The screen doesn’t bother me and the battery life is much better than the Max. I also use the Note 10 plus at the weekend- that’s a beast with the most beautiful screen, I’ve seen. Thanks for a great review - your opinion is always valued. 😘
BlIBf26Cris;I’ve been lucky enough to have had most of the best phones in 2019...best phone other than the ultimate cameras is the OnePlus 7T, best overall camera’s iPhone 11 series, best point and shoot single photo, pixel 4xl, best compact phone, S10 e. Best media phone Huawei Mate 20 X.
BlIBf26Cris;"my bad for assuming ""affordability"" is included in the criteria... i'll show myself out now..."
BlIBf26Cris;Quad hd isnt the same as 4k...so its not industry leading.. your chatting bollocks.
BlIBf26Cris;The best phone? For me it has to be the Note 10+. No it hasn't got 90hz display. Yes they lost the headphone jack and a few other features. But all together it's an amazing phone. And genuinely unlike every phone out there.
BlIBf26Cris;jitter bug
BlIBf26Cris;The big galaxy note is still my favorite  despite  sammy pissing me  off by omitting the god damned bloody 3.5 mm headphone .......  jack GAAAH !  ....... i`m not angry about it though  ]:   .
BlIBf26Cris; And i would give apple  some brownie points for not going full google gimmick factory this year and just  refining what was already pretty good phones ,  
BlIBf26Cris;For me the galaxy Note 10 is my best phone
BlIBf26Cris;I currently have a Samsung Note 8.  I am looking for a phone with the best cameras.  I would like it to have a beautiful display and run without glitches.  Is it too much to ask that these very expensive phones improve the quality of their phone calls???  I love my current phone's ring tone (Celine Dion and Josh  Groban's The Prayer), but sometimes it just doesn't ring, and I get a Missed Call notification.  Voice quality is fair, but not great.  I have to say the worst feature of the phone is the telephone.  If I didn't want all the other features, I would say the best phone for making calls and voice quality was the Jitterbug, which cost maybe a 10th of what my new phone cost.  I may go back to it and dust off my digital camera.
BlIBf26Cris;Am shams form sudan Africa and I care Samsung note 5 I hope for some upgrade
BlIBf26Cris;Where can I get that wallpaper on second phone in thumbnail?
BlIBf26Cris;Phones is a camera showdown like wtf everything that they are upgrading are literally cameras but samsung has everything it has a foldable phone,flipable phone,cameras im not saying that idont like any other phones exept for samsung this is my opinion.
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung dady of all Chinese phones
BlIBf26Cris;I have a Note 9. The Note 10 is basically the same, only minor changes.
BlIBf26Cris;A favourite of mine is the s10+ a brilliant all-rounder that still holds its own today and if the rumours are true the s11 sounds exciting. Hats off to the Apple for the iphone11 they produced a great phone when pressure was mounting.
BlIBf26Cris;When you are in apple ecosystem, you can't escape from that unless you leave it with iphone 7 plus below. For me, i'm free from apple ecoshit'em when i can't use my iphone 5 anymore and switch to android. Well you never know when i will be switching to Apple again, maybe winning apple giveaway or shit.
BlIBf26Cris;Redmi Note 8 pro with helio g90t processor is still the best smartphone.
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei one and only to choose
BlIBf26Cris;No compromises.
BlIBf26Cris;Unpopular opinion
BlIBf26Cris;My favorite phone of 2019 is the KEY2 Red Edition
BlIBf26Cris;the only issues One Plus really needs to address is the lack of internal storage,  average camera and sub par speakers. they fix those and they can easily hang with samsung etc
BlIBf26Cris;Why is always all about the cameras?I am not buying pro camera,only phone and i want to see pluses and minuses and not just camera.
BlIBf26Cris;"Best phone? It's all your personal opinion.. Like they say ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"". I enjoy iPhones but that's my personal preference, you might enjoy Vivo phones.. they all have their ups and downs. 👍👍 happy shopping guys"
BlIBf26Cris;I have two picks for the best: The s10+, why? It has all the premium features including the kitchen sink. The cameras, display & battery are simply a pleasure to use. My second, on cyber Monday I picked up the 3a XL  which has the outstanding camera. The OLED display, battery power 6to7hrs SOT, stereo speakers, software, the 670processer works well, no lags or stutters. These are my top two and use both, great review, your voice is nice to listen to!
BlIBf26Cris;Where’s the google pixel 5 for the leaks
BlIBf26Cris;I still think the note 10 plus has the best camera of all phones including the beloved iPhones.
BlIBf26Cris;And whose this idiot who doesn't have a YouTube channel and is busy shooting video at 4k 60, even 1080p is over kill for the crappy videos I shoot.
BlIBf26Cris;The problem with Huawei are very annoying. If that could have been resolved I would have got one last year.
BlIBf26Cris;awesome video sir. greeted u on twitter and gonna greet u again here. happy birthday to you sir..!!
BlIBf26Cris;Should i buy s10 or note 9 or s9plus
BlIBf26Cris;Noeplus 7pro shouldn't be on this list because of screen issues ,glitches. I don't recommend buying it an les you have guaranty and U can return it if screen start flickering
BlIBf26Cris;Galaxy s10 is in my opinion the best bang for buck.
BlIBf26Cris;sorry but your hair needs fixed! that wee bit at the top annoys me! apart from that good review :)
BlIBf26Cris;iPhone xr is that a good option in 2020 @ASBYT
BlIBf26Cris;I suspected my wife of cheating on me but I never had any proof. This went on for months, I didn't know what to do. i was so paranoid and decided to find a solution, i saw a recommendation about a PI hacker and decided to contact him. I explained the situation about my wife to him and he said he was going to help me.I gave him all the informations he required and afterwards i received all my wife’s iPhones Text messages, whatsApp messages and calls, I was hurt when i saw a picture of my wife and her lover. I feel so bad about infidelity. but i am glad hackgoodness on instagram was able to help me get all this information, you can contact him via Gmail HACKGOODNESS@
BlIBf26Cris;Wallpaper cowboy bebop
BlIBf26Cris;Got any info on the new 2020 phones Samsung S+11, Note +11, LG?
BlIBf26Cris;I hate to be nit-picky but it sounded like you kept saying the OnePlus 17....as opposed to what it actually is, the OnePlus 7 T. Additionally, i will never buy Apple products but thanks for the review.
BlIBf26Cris;I think LG g7 is underrated. £200 for wireless charging, 845 processor, water resistant, good cameras and really good speakers.
BlIBf26Cris;Upcoming phone that I am looking forward to is Google. Because I am really looking forward to Google's ultra wide angle implementation. I currently have one plus 1 because I lost my s8 3 months back and don't have money to spend. I would want a phone it will definitely be the one with best camera specs and iPhone nailed it this year. Would love to have that iphone camera power and it's an overall decent phone.
BlIBf26Cris;Really still enjoying my Samsung s10 plus. Still a excellent phone in my opinion, just saying. But you said note 10 plus and it’s much the same with a pen.
BlIBf26Cris;The problem with Samsung is that if you buy their phones you are directly supporting weapons production because Samsung also manufactures weapons for war
BlIBf26Cris;I got a iPhone 7 for Christmas and I don’t really like it the battery is so bad
BlIBf26Cris;No Samsung Note 9??
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung Note 10+ upgrade my iPhone 6s pls🤩#ASBYT
BlIBf26Cris;The smart thing to do.... is not to use smart phone
BlIBf26Cris;Waiting for the next generation Pro Max iPhone (if it really has a 90-120Hz display) ... 😂 I am a fan of OnePlus since 1+1 but I’m not quite sure whether I should buy one or not, since Huawei Samsung and OnePlus are like replicas of each other from the front these days. I want Huawei to run their own custom OS, I want OnePlus to be globally available and I want Samsung to be more user friendly on updates, longer term services etc. To me the top 5 would be:
BlIBf26Cris;How tf ppl really like the camera bump on S11 ? It's disgusting I'd rather a 1000 times have an Alcatel than that just for camera bump
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei mate 30 pro & samsung galaxy note 10 plus These two are mobile only and look great👌👌👌
BlIBf26Cris;Iphone 11👎👎👎😂😂😂😂
BlIBf26Cris;I bought the Xperia 10. The only reason, I needed a new phone and O2 are selling these with £160 off till 22nd December. Also if you put a £15 big bundle on your mobile you get 20gbs instead of 6gbs for 3 months. New and existing customers. Ask O2. Offer ends 15th January.
BlIBf26Cris;If a phone is above $700+, it should have every single thing. If I'm counting that much for an iPhone 11, there should be no compromises.
BlIBf26Cris;I'm using a $300 Mi 9T that has an OLED panel for instance.
BlIBf26Cris;Apple with less than half the Ram of the other flagship phones..out performs the lot.
BlIBf26Cris;Guys which is better to buy im liking the huawei nova 5t or samsung galaxy A71 ??? Help me out guys thank you
BlIBf26Cris;Best smartphone of the year, ROG 2
BlIBf26Cris;Redunculous😂😂😂
BlIBf26Cris;iPhone is just a company that is made for money that's all they want and that's why they keep making something free into a expensive add on.
BlIBf26Cris;You describe the great features on the different models. But you never talk about it being a good phone.  In meaning nice clear unbroken voice communication.  That's the one feature if poor ruins phone.  Every Samsung I've brought home is junk as a phone.  And has been returned.
BlIBf26Cris;Title “5 best budget smartphones”?  I do not consider paying upwards of £200 to well over £1000 for a basic commodity like a mobile phone to be described as ‘budget’!  Perhaps I’m old fashioned......thank God!
BlIBf26Cris;conclusion Pixel 4 and iPhone 11 Pro are the best in 2020.
BlIBf26Cris;Ok
BlIBf26Cris;Top video.samsung fold style is futuristic.iphone is in its own ecosystem world.pixel is nasty overpriced snob.huawei suffers from google pangs.
BlIBf26Cris;The best hope of vfm phones lies with xiaomi,realme,oppo(dad of realme) & 1plus,the latter 3 being kids of bbk.
BlIBf26Cris;Speed of autofocus for quality quick snaps...would really appreciate that.
BlIBf26Cris;Is the Samsung A100 phones still schedule for release in the 1st Qtr. 2020?  And, what is your evaluation of the Vivo V19 Pro?  I am not looking for a phone that has every feature under the Sun.  But, my main desire is to have a phone that has a very good to excellent camera (32-megapixel front and 64-megapixel rear).  I considered buying a camera but decided If I can find the right phone then that would eliminate my need for a camera.  Your opinion would be appreciated.
BlIBf26Cris;Thumbs down on this one because all of these phones you need to take out another mortgage to buy buy them!😒
BlIBf26Cris;Hi. Fan
BlIBf26Cris;I hope they make a phone with 35 camera on the rear. more camera is better.
BlIBf26Cris;Just picked up the OnePlus Pro 7T McLaren Edition ($900) Jan 6, 2020 ... So far... I freakin' LOVE IT!!! I came from an older Note 5 that worked just fine and I was very happy with...but it's 4 years old, time for a new one. I was sticker shocked for the Note 10+ ($1,600), so I decided to step back from Samsung and the reviews from the OnePlus & Pro line up were amazing.... so...here I am...
BlIBf26Cris;The iPhone 11 has the best LCD and you won’t miss the OLED because you won’t have them together!
BlIBf26Cris;I'm thinking of buying Samsung Note 8 in start of 2020. Can anyone please tell me is it worth it or not!??
BlIBf26Cris;Booooring and obvious choices
BlIBf26Cris;The advert start smiling shows a woman with bad teeth then the same women with make up on, hair straightened, smiling. Why?
BlIBf26Cris;there only phones ffs all do the same thing just abit faster ,,just chill abit just a phone
BlIBf26Cris;1 of your honarable mentions was the realme x2 pro... but you didnt give any reasons why its only a honorable mention and not on the list. I think this is one of the best phones this year... for 350$ you get all top specs and if you think: well then the softwere is garbage.  well not anymore cuz its becomming better and better and it will be near stock android just after 2-3 months
BlIBf26Cris;we need european and american players in this emerging industrial challenge. bored to see the smartphone nowadays, they are just look the same in everything. no beauty or any standard for each other. each time they launch a new one, it just like a new marketing strategy in a same form factor. lol
BlIBf26Cris;why the fold samasung it should be listed in worst phones... the screen can be scratched by finger for god sake 😠😠😠😠😠
BlIBf26Cris;No flagship if u ain't got the greens
BlIBf26Cris;K20 pro, op 7 pro and Asus ROG 2. If you need capable and great phone. Note 10, iPhones and useless Huawei if you need status simbol and want to show off with overpriced and not worthy asked price. Google 4 series is not even worth mentioning.
BlIBf26Cris;Can you please send me me one. Coz I can't even afford any of that.
BlIBf26Cris;Ill take any high end phone that doesnt have curved edges.
BlIBf26Cris;I like my OnePlus 7pro 5g on sprints network. Yes I know, Sprint but my wife had a meltdown with T-Mobiles customer service and after being with them for over 15 years gave them the finger. I lost the jump one demand with T-Mobile but they were changing it so much that it was making it not worth it anymore. So I am in the 7 pro, I had the Tmobile version and decided to go with sprints version even though 5g ain't here yet. I did get a 5g signal for about 2 minutes while on vacation in Disneyland a couple of months ago but, eh. Now that I have gone back to the change phones at the normal 18 month cycle now I love my OnePlus 7 pro, it's great for gaming and watching content on. No notch, or hole, or tear drop, clean screen, and the pop-up camera is not an issue, I'm to ugly for selfies, also, there is no hacking to activate my front camera without me knowing that it is activated, if closed it is off.
BlIBf26Cris;Note 10+ is not a flagship like Note9 used to be ....it doesn't have a jack, iris scaner, led notifications, blood pressure, spo2, dual....at least dual led flash camera, dual front facing camera...
BlIBf26Cris;And so on
BlIBf26Cris;Idk about the pixel 4 that thing is ugly af and the Iphone 11 pro may have a better camera.
BlIBf26Cris;Blah Blah Blah,, all you guys come out with the same blurb,,,you extol the virtues of any phone, gadget or piece of tech, you get for free!!!! You need to get into the real world , of AFFORDABILITY ,, these phones are not worth the price,, only to tackle tarts who want the latest  gadgetry!!!  Do a sensible post on Quality affordable everyday phones, and maybe I won't thumbs you down for being a bought and paid for promo guy for tech junk!!!!!!!!
BlIBf26Cris;S10+ does not have great stereo speakers, they sound as as cheap crappy junk compared to iPhone Xs
BlIBf26Cris;If you buy the $900 phone it does the same thing taking phone calls browsing the net and if you buy the $100 phone it does the same thing taking calls and browsing the web and taking some photos my dear friends these people are earning money from YouTube but don't spend your hard-earned money on phones think before you buy do you need a $900 phone what can doe by 100$ phone....
BlIBf26Cris;Samsung Note 10 worst phone
BlIBf26Cris;I have the Huawei Mate Lite now, but I think I will upgrade to either the p30 or x2 pro.  As an American that  believes in the specs of Chinese phones you just need to have a trusted friend who is a computer science expert. Other wise pay more for Apple or Samsung...
BlIBf26Cris;apple is only overpriced for its ios and software update legacy otherwise its components are reasonable.
BlIBf26Cris;Yoy didn’t do the give away announcement ☹️
BlIBf26Cris;If u really need a good phone right now ...trust me not an iphone or samsung........ buy huawei p30 pro .... the phone experience is at its peak!!
BlIBf26Cris;Smartphones are getting a little stupid these days. They outspec many laptops but who does any real work on that tiny screen...seriously? It seems like a race to see who can access their social media fastest. Regarding cameras, they can only trumpet their pixel count because people are satisfied with mediocre photos that don't pass the zoom test in any way, shape or form.
BlIBf26Cris;I disagree about the pro max video recording as I've seen the p30 pro having better video.
BlIBf26Cris;Sony Xperia 5.
BlIBf26Cris;Those are ugly
BlIBf26Cris;"fyi.   "" A word I have been hearing the last year or two is “redonkulous,” (or alternatively “redonkulus”), which the Urban Dictionary defines as “significantly more absurd than ridiculous, to an almost impossible degree.”Jun 3, 2010 from google search as I have heard it about five  or more years ago in Aus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       thanks for the vid. now I am much more informed but spoilt for choice. What do they sound like and how is the reception? I am still curios as I really just need a phone, the camera is not the strength I am looking for and I have noticed there is quite a difference among brands for the quality of those two things (where I live any way so it is relevant). I like the fold open phone - I've been waiting for that. Would the screen cope with being opened and closed a lot of times?"
BlIBf26Cris;Apple. So simple.
BlIBf26Cris;I got The xiaomi mi note 10 here in Brazil and am loving it.
BlIBf26Cris;It baffles me why anyone would buy a Note phone. The stylus is close to being useless to almost everyone I know who owns a Note (including me). Back in the days, getting a Note was worth it for the larger display. Now? Why would you pay so much more for almost nothing more.
BlIBf26Cris;No surprises
BlIBf26Cris;Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro is all the beast I need. It's going to get to stage where phones will be so powerful the film industry will use the to film scenes.
BlIBf26Cris;the list phone that you have is not affordable for lower class people.
BlIBf26Cris;This whole Trump sabotaging Huawei really sucks 😕
BlIBf26Cris;To say that all the pixels needs is an ultra wide camera is a bit of an overstatement. The phone is forgettable in nearly every category. Screen, battery, accessory, if camera processing is all googles got then I can just download the app and get a better phone in every way.
BlIBf26Cris;Anyone else think Samsung and Apple don't belong on a top 10 list?
BlIBf26Cris;put list with timings in description. if you think i'll spend 20 minutes to find out that i cannot afford any of the bloddy phones think again...
BlIBf26Cris;Well the back of the One Plus in 2020 wins hands down!
BlIBf26Cris;Huawei Mate 30 Pro
BlIBf26Cris;And
BlIBf26Cris;Xiaomi Redmi K30 Pro
BlIBf26Cris;❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
BlIBf26Cris;Dude you're a Chelsea fan ,ur my club bro man, blue is d colour Chelsea is the club
BlIBf26Cris;LG G8X
BlIBf26Cris;"hey guy you missed the point i bet you don""t like lg - lg is by far better than all that you talk about lg v50 is today the best phone for 2019 i know that some will not like it but no one that you talk about is match for the v50 those phones that come form china are copy from others you shuld know that !"
BlIBf26Cris;mi 9 is best and best price
BlIBf26Cris;Honestly, buying a OnePlus 7t has ruined basically every other phone out there for me. That 90hz display has completely spoiled me and 60hz displays just feel choppy to me now. I hope that 2020 sees most phones adopting at least a 90hz display now.
BlIBf26Cris;Why don't you guys talk about LG's phones. It's not like these phones are better than the v50.
BlIBf26Cris;Not one Sony in there 🤔
BlIBf26Cris;I don't mind the big bezel on the Pixel 4. I think it is a stunning looking phone. But 2800mA battery is a deal breaker!
BlIBf26Cris;Apple sucks
BlIBf26Cris;I want Samsung s10+
BlIBf26Cris;If you can give for Xmas gift
BlIBf26Cris;I'm a fan of you
BlIBf26Cris;Iphone 11 is da best!
BlIBf26Cris;Anyone who recommends an Apple phone as a reviewer has totally lost my respect, why would anyone in the right mind review a phone that is purposely slowed down by future updates, this should this be illegal, I could not see Ford selling you a car then tell you next year the performance of the car is going to greatly reduced and eventually not work at all.
BlIBf26Cris;Rip apple only the double price but not good features.
BlIBf26Cris;I am indian man
4OnwUz-I2GI;imagine being a phone laying there and not getting picked for anything...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Him secretly calling you poor for 25 minutes.
4OnwUz-I2GI;What to do when you have too much money:
4OnwUz-I2GI;Buy trophies for your smartphones 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;Summary:
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best Big Phone Award: 1:11
4OnwUz-I2GI;The Royole FlexPai is so bad it lost the worst smartphone award lol 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""Bust of the year: Google pixel 4"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;As I sit there with my pixel 4 I just got yesterday
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wonder how my phone felt watching me watching this
4OnwUz-I2GI;The moment when you realize you have a 99$ phone and his budget phones started at 300$😑
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm missing one category, that is Best sound quality. Not just speakers itself, but taking into consideration Things like LDAC support, Dolby Atmos etc.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Suggestion for next year. I would like to see a ""Best old phone"" or something similar with a better title. Like a phone that holds up today but is like 2 years old now."
4OnwUz-I2GI;This is interesting because people are keeping their phone longer and longer, and many people don't buy a new NEW phone but an older flagship like a Galaxy S9.
4OnwUz-I2GI;That table is worth more than me
4OnwUz-I2GI;When a phone has more ram than your computer...
4OnwUz-I2GI;The Samsung s10e is extremely underrated
4OnwUz-I2GI;The professionalism in this is orgasmic
4OnwUz-I2GI;I’ve never wanted to flip a table so bad
4OnwUz-I2GI;When your phone wins the Bust of the Year😑
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching this with OnePlus makes me feel proud.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me staring at my phone hoping it'll get picked.
4OnwUz-I2GI;where the phones gonna put their trophies doe
4OnwUz-I2GI;Desk Falls:
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: The best phone durability is
4OnwUz-I2GI;ROG phone: Wins 3 major awards, no MVP mention
4OnwUz-I2GI;OP7 Pro: Wins 0 awards, gets MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sometimes you give it all but still not enough..
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019: iPhone has the best camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;"2020: Samsung: ""allow me to re introduce myself"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Proudly oneplus 7 pro user,  best smartphone, the MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;7:29  A few years ago Samsung blew up the competition with their battery
4OnwUz-I2GI;My whole education fees laying on a table.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Alright this year y'all gonna have to add a poor af category. Cause those ""Budget"" phones still too high for my blood 🤣"
4OnwUz-I2GI;So hear me out Marques, you already cover the gamut of smartphones in the year. But I think there may be space for one more award and I think it could be called the Legacy Award. Which would be a subjective/objective choice for the phone you'd most like to go back to from the prior calendar year. The rationale behind this is that phones all age differently and people often don't upgrade every year. It could be an interesting way to look back at some seriously good 2018 phones that you would still like to use if you had to. Congrats on 10 million and the tenure of your channel 👌🏽
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google be like: damnit, first we had rewind now this...
4OnwUz-I2GI;"imagine the phones experiencing anxiety before the announcement of the ""smartphone of the year""."
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 5:
4OnwUz-I2GI;Last year we made something you didn't like
4OnwUz-I2GI;This guy is literally sitting with around $30,000 worth of phones in front of him like it’s nothing lmao
4OnwUz-I2GI;5:27 Alright that was smooth.
4OnwUz-I2GI;90s kids: I got my first phone when I was 25
4OnwUz-I2GI;2000s kids: I got my first phone at age 15
4OnwUz-I2GI;3:49 really didn't see the face camera because of the background lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;I’m not even joking: that table is worth more than me on the black market
4OnwUz-I2GI;That moment when he calls a 400$ smartphone budget like fan that ain't even mid range for me, that's flagship pricing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;They should be making an official event of this
4OnwUz-I2GI;That is the most expensive table I've ever seen
4OnwUz-I2GI;As I watch this on my OnePlus 7 pro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I do have complaints though, curved screen is meh my next phone won't have curved screen. Also no headphone jack. Besides that I love it though.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""If u turn the refresh rate of this 120 hertz oled down to 90 or 60 hertz which u probably never would want to do that"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me with 30 hertz
4OnwUz-I2GI;1950: Oscars giving people awards!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;2020: Lets give phones awards!
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have always loved this guy, he has always been my go-to tech guru. Amazing to see how far he has come and will continue to go 🙏🙏🙏, Bravo mate!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Damn LG didn't even get mentioned
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marquees : Bust of the year award goes to the Google Pixel 4
4OnwUz-I2GI;....
4OnwUz-I2GI;YouTube algorithm:...wait, that's illegal
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thank you for the reviews, just ordered One Plus 7 Pro . Update: Great phone, really love it, so smooth and fast, the display is vivid, this is a daily driver.
4OnwUz-I2GI;cough Apple was overall mentioned 4 times and Samsung 5 times, and Samsung won 2 awards, with Apple 1.
4OnwUz-I2GI;just coughing up facts
4OnwUz-I2GI;"DESCRIPTION: ""Top Budget Phones [12:03]"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Timestamp's first phrase: ""Samsung Galaxy Fold"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me: Bruhhhhh *wheeeze*
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hotel: Trivago
4OnwUz-I2GI;When my device is not even on the desk😳
4OnwUz-I2GI;Only Marques would buy a trophy for a phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;This called me broke in every language
4OnwUz-I2GI;1:20 brofist headphones in the background
4OnwUz-I2GI;The moment he said bust of the year, I remembered his disappointed voice when he was reviewing pixel 4 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""This is a suggestion I gave to them from the first one,"" was that a slip of the tongue?"
4OnwUz-I2GI;Saying Google phones are the worst on a Google site this is why I love marques
4OnwUz-I2GI;I feel like MKBHD looks at every table and be like: you?  no not you .you? and then takes a completely random phone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Jk
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please consider the category: best rugged phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;i love how whenever he's talking about ASUS the b-roll runs ...
4OnwUz-I2GI;where's the moto razr 2019 in the design category?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Glad to see Marques give the bust of the year to the Pixel 4. He is usually a pixel guy.  Google needs to stop thinking it's the Apple of the Android world
4OnwUz-I2GI;When he can play Mahjong using his phones.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love watching the end on my OnePlus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lets freaking go i always belived in you OnePlus
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ayyyy my phone won overall best 🙌🏾😂I finally upgraded from my pixel 2 xl to the OnePlus 7 pro and aside from the camera I'm very pleased
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD: And for the bust of the year award....
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me, holding my Pixel 4: Dear god, please don't say it...
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm still using my Pixel 1
4OnwUz-I2GI;:D
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey the most budget phone of 2019 is realme X2 pro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was legit watching this while doing my homework, super entertaining!! 👌👌👍😁
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thank you Marques! A very honest award rundown... Rog 2 is indeed the baddass daddy of 2019 imo 👍
4OnwUz-I2GI;So what did we learn this year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Apple listened to feedback and made major improvements by adding an ultrawide lens and night mode
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD : Calling redmi k20 pro a budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Meanwhile me: using redmi 8a
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019: iPhone best camera ever
4OnwUz-I2GI;2020: iPhone users throws it to buy s20 ultra
4OnwUz-I2GI;Yeah we need 2020 in the end of this year plzzz, this was a great video❤️
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""Compact"" smartphone - 5.8"" screen lol"
4OnwUz-I2GI;Imagine being so rich, you can play cards with phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best budget phone is REALME X2 pro✌️
4OnwUz-I2GI;Phone Guru! Keep doing your thing Marques! I've been with you for years and still love what you do.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching it on my Asus rog phone 2 <3
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pure gem <3
4OnwUz-I2GI;One Plus on my eyes.. I already love with one plus anyway..
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was waiting for the best budget phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;Well I’m still waiting!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;immagine the company wanting the toilet award shipped out XD
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who remembers his first Zune review 🥺 he grew up so fast
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marq is so inhumane!
4OnwUz-I2GI;he doesnt let the phones give their winning speeches.
4OnwUz-I2GI;My tuition just chillin on a table lmao
4OnwUz-I2GI;"The category ""budget phone"" feels pretty meaningless when you include the OnePlus 7T, which is *twice the price* of the phones you picked as the winners of the category."
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus on a 2yr winning streak 🔥
4OnwUz-I2GI;(watching on my OnePlus 7 Pro)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Maybe the first ever video i watched for straight 25 minutes without skipping. Great work MKBHD! :D
4OnwUz-I2GI;BEST PHONES FOR MARQUES
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019:Oneplus 7 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;2018:Oneplus 6t
4OnwUz-I2GI;2017:Samsung Galaxy Note 8
4OnwUz-I2GI;It's funny to think I'm now watching this on the OnePlus 7pro you convinced me to switch to 😄
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Watching from OnePlus 7 Pro; bought from the launch) the best phone for tech geeks."
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching from a Oneplus 7T Pro 💙
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hahaha my phone won I'm so happy 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love the one plus 7 pro and t pro phones. I love my one plus 7 t pro Mclaren 😄👍
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was getting a little pissed, I really like the oneplus 7 pro and he just wasn’t calling it😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;This man is so intelligent & intellectual, I absolutely love his professionalism. Great choices and explanations by the way.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think Best budget phone runner up should be Realme x2 pro... 😍 not Google phone..
4OnwUz-I2GI;He is busting Google pixel 4 on YouTube and for that Google gives him money for showing it. 😂😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wish Sony got mentioned for it's improvement
4OnwUz-I2GI;"And you are my best smartphone ""reviewer"" winner 😁"
4OnwUz-I2GI;When u just see other comments and say “i wish that was me”
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me watching on my RM3S that didn't get any award 😢
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think MKBHD should make a new category for the most innovative smartphone of the year in the next years.
4OnwUz-I2GI;that's a lot of phones, can i at least have one? 🤣 been using my xiaomi redmi 4x for almost 4 years
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me, watching the video in my OnePlus 7 Pro: happiness noises
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just got the One Plus 7 Pro 5G, love this phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;THey made my phone feel low
4OnwUz-I2GI;At least the pixel 4 won something
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus rog phone 2 is the best smartphone ever of 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;I can finally afford that phone from 2017.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just looking at this since my phone just lost it's rear camera (oneplus 5t) and I use it more often than I thought, but I ordered a OnePlus 7t and this made me just that much more excited
4OnwUz-I2GI;hey marques can you pls review the blu bold n1 because it could be the best budget smartphone! if you can thank yoou very much!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Well we all know why this video won't be on trending...
4OnwUz-I2GI;14:00 i was really waiting for a mention of realme x2 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love how you did this but I hate how I didn't know this happened each year! Hopefully next year I can be a guest and a performer!
4OnwUz-I2GI;i'm actually considering getting OnePlus 7t Pro than a new iPhone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Congrats ASUS, you've always been badass
4OnwUz-I2GI;Imagine Google claiming their toilet trophy
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on my one plus :) love your reviews !
4OnwUz-I2GI;4:04 Boys and girls... And now... The sound of CHEAP!
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD, what doyou do with all of these devices when you're done reviewing?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was just waiting for him to pick up the redmi k20 pro...cause that's my phone😁
4OnwUz-I2GI;Mkbhd: “Google pixel 4 is bust of the year”
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google: “you’re uninvited to early access next year”
4OnwUz-I2GI;10m subscribers... I subscribe his channel when he did the review of I phone 5s
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me:Sweating because my phone has not come up yet.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I felt like I won the award when he said google pixel 3a
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey hey! I was waiting for it. I have the 7T Pro McLaren and DAMN ITS A GREAT PHONE! Thanks for justifying my purchase! Lol!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Love the intro track
4OnwUz-I2GI;I bought a 1p7pro cause this video <3 i had a iPhone 5s :(
4OnwUz-I2GI;How about the Samsung m30s it also has fast charging and 6000 mAh battery
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thanks for the good reliable tech reviews . I know you give a good honest opinion. Because of this I just bought a OnePlus . (McLaren) . Had a iPhone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;everybody gangsta till they see the Asus ROG's price.
4OnwUz-I2GI;After watching your reviews on the Oneplus 7 Pro, that's probably the phone I'll be replacing my LG V30+ with.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Love my 7 Pro! Let's go OnePlus! But i am surprised the Note got no love at all. Ouch  😆
4OnwUz-I2GI;And I can’t even buy earbuds. 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching from my s8 plus :)
4OnwUz-I2GI;hey what about my favorite.  LG  phone..!
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Marques, Yes Please; a review on the Motorola One Hyper, would be very welcome."
4OnwUz-I2GI;Was feeling anxious about ordering a OnePlus 7 Pro over all other phones with a new carrier I switched to...NOT ANYMORE.
4OnwUz-I2GI;You missed realme x2 pro in budget department 😊
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best battery:
4OnwUz-I2GI;Energizer phone sad noises
4OnwUz-I2GI;Samsung A70 is the best fone of 2019 cheap and best
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just when I thought you finally picking up a Redmi Note Pro, turns out it's a One+ 😔
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thanks for making this video. It was nice to reminisce over the smartphones of 2019.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who else, like me, was so far behind in their Watch Later playlist that they are watching this in 2020?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ive got 20 phones, 10 for the plug, 10 for the load
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love how he dresses up and makes trophies for his own event😂😂😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;Only Marques would do that
4OnwUz-I2GI;Edit: Thanks for the likes! 1.5k is the highest amount of likes I've ever had.😅🙏

4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching This On OnePlus 7 Pro 😁
4OnwUz-I2GI;i love you, i like you. You are my IDOL, i alway learn from your videos
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oneplus will promote this in Indian Newspaper tomorrow 😁
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wish I could have one of your phone you have. I have been stuck with my galaxy alpha and never had  the ability to buy a new phone eversince. 😞
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on A OnePlus 7 Pro ☺️
4OnwUz-I2GI;‚few years ago mkbhd spit on htc 10 , i bought it just for fun , till this day , i loved that fone like crazy
4OnwUz-I2GI; , so guess what , most definitely im buying pixel 4 xl
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on my McLaren
4OnwUz-I2GI;I totally agree with everything in this video. Oneplus is really stepping up their game, iPhone made huge improvements, Samsung bringing out their best, and Asus being amazing for its price.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I bought pixel 3a two weeks ago. I was planning to go for pixel 4. now i am happy :-)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Yaya I feel proud that my phone got MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;I know for a fact e flexing his J's on 16:08
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best budget phone award: naaah I still can’t afford it
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think Google wants their bust of the year trophy shipped out to them.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching this on my ROG Phone 2
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thanks for that overview
4OnwUz-I2GI;Would live the Motorola 1 Hyper review!
4OnwUz-I2GI;You never disappoint! Excellent video... Loved the MVP lead up.
4OnwUz-I2GI;When you announced the Google pixel 4 as bust of the year, my Google home heard it and started reading off specs.
4OnwUz-I2GI;It was great to watch this video on my OP 7T pro 😎
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just wondering if Google requested to have their Bust Of the Year award shipped to them... 🤔
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thank you marque brownie for this
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching this on my OnePlus 7t pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why is this the best award show, blows Oscars and other shit out of the water
4OnwUz-I2GI;EDIT: I edited to make a joke...lost the heart Marques gave me
4OnwUz-I2GI;16:19 Google Somalian 4
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love Chinese phones! Huawei, Oppo, Htc, Xiaomi etc🇨🇳
4OnwUz-I2GI;And I am still using Windows Phone :P But I am tempted by ROG2. I wonder when will they realease ROG3.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus phone looks and seems so amazing. the pixel 4 let us down so hard this year. didn't even upgrade.
4OnwUz-I2GI;There should have been best display.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching with my OnePlus 7 Pro, bought a month ago after 6th anniversary sale and didn't even expect it to be anywhere near the best device of 2019.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Suddenly I hear the name and Goosebumps.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Fantastic review, thanks for sharing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Looking at that many quality phones gives  me chills 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching this from my cracked note 3
4OnwUz-I2GI;This is why you’re my favorite tech YouTuber. The information is incredible and the animation & presentation is visually pleasing. This is why you deserve well over 10M subs. Happy New Year Marques!
4OnwUz-I2GI;About the ROG 2 it's good point to remember that have also 2 version with different specs (like intern memory and ram) and price range, keeping the same battery and the same screen refresh rate.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you give me one of those phones I really need one you have too many
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on a redimi 3s prime
4OnwUz-I2GI;Picked up the ROG2 512gb 12gb ram phone! Amazing!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;“Yeah it’s my show, so I get to be a little biased” 😂😂😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was considering getting a compact phone next. Hopefully in another 2 years, gamestream can be a thing and it'll be worth getting another big phone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on ASUS ROG phone ll
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about Samsung s10? I was expecting a best display award for it. :-)
4OnwUz-I2GI;All phones on that table beside the iphone are underrated
4OnwUz-I2GI;Do the trophies stay in your house. Or do you send them out. LOL Thanks great review as always.
4OnwUz-I2GI;for anyone using the pixel 4, ENABLE DARK THEME!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me : watching this video on my Samsung s3 😮 ...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Imageing haveing that many phones.
4OnwUz-I2GI;There should also be an award for the phone that holds up the best from last year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Compact phones are amazing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm glad i bought the best compact phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think the Samsung 10 line are the most beautiful smartphones🥰 But I still can't decide between S10+ and Note10+😭
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Perennially; on a yearly basis for several years"
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: Anyone want their trophy?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google: Yes we want the golden toilet bowl, very proud of ourselves
4OnwUz-I2GI;AY, I apparently own the MVP phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I will put an challege on the comment section.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you make a list with a TOTAL worth of every cellphone in this tablet
4OnwUz-I2GI;Did any of the companies actually contact Marques to get their trophies? :D
4OnwUz-I2GI;The hell man, the rog 2 cant be used for voice and data in the US on Verizon, Sprint or AT&T how are you even recommending this?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wonder how many phone companies are watching this video.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love my OnePlus 7 pro have up the note 10 for it. Never looked back
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you give just one of those phone please..🙏😔
4OnwUz-I2GI;Very glad there's no music to this since i'm listening to some good stuff while listening to this. (sounds bad at first, but i mean it as a compliment)
4OnwUz-I2GI;I bought the OnePlus 7t and now I'm silently crying to see the MVP award going to OnePlus 7pro 😒😒😒
4OnwUz-I2GI;No doubt that the Pixel 4 is the letdown flagship of the year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;All of this phone prices combined can pay for my college😐
4OnwUz-I2GI;5:28 how tho
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on 7 pro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;thanks marques

4OnwUz-I2GI;my purchase of rog phone 2 feels so validated rn

4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus is like 'Oh screw market man. We got 3 awards from MKBHD!!! Let's party like there's no tomorrow.'
4OnwUz-I2GI;Does Marques send this awards to the companies that win the prize,or they just sit somewhere in the office?
4OnwUz-I2GI;S10 was never an option as a budget phone ?... 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;& I've none of them 😪

4OnwUz-I2GI;My Oneplus 7 Pro approves this message!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Good for you mate.  Having the confidence to say ‘yes, my approval and study of these items is worth something’. And it is!  One day we will attend a bigger Marques Event.  Keep going!  Your story is an inspiration!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Biggest, baddest flagship this year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;            -MKBHD 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;@mkbhd what do you do with all of the phones after you review them??
4OnwUz-I2GI;I really feel like you are one of the most ''unbiased'' tech Youtubers out there. Keep it up man!
4OnwUz-I2GI;EXCELLENT VIDEO!! Thanks!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;You forgot best audio, LG for the win with that quad dac
4OnwUz-I2GI;Props to MKBHD for no ads, reasons why he's one of my favorite YouTubers.
4OnwUz-I2GI;A review for the motorola hyper would be great please
4OnwUz-I2GI;That intro track tho...
4OnwUz-I2GI;hahahaha watching this on my HUAWEI phone!!  yall missing this one out
4OnwUz-I2GI;Imagine being have those all phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;ASUS: Wow, our mailbox is full
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google: Oh look, a tumbleweed.
4OnwUz-I2GI;We need more coverage of compact phones. More runner ups for the midrange price point.
4OnwUz-I2GI;can give me one phone bcoz i have been most watching your video for longtime now
4OnwUz-I2GI;I would gladly take that unused iphone 11pro. :D
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love my OnePlus 7 pro. I initially thought you were not even going to mention the pro😂.  I gave up watching last week because I believed my phone was the best and I wasn't going to hear it. I'm glad I watched the video to the end.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"I own Motorola... is it in Top 10 of anything !!! ;)"
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love the compect phone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;10:15 where is Huawei fold device ??
4OnwUz-I2GI;hey marques can you please do a review on the black shark two pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;thanks
4OnwUz-I2GI;After the first minutes I was so sure that the OnePlus 7 Pro wasn't going to win anything and then....OMGG
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love how the samsung s10 won first place in his blind picture test voted by the youtube community but he still gives first place to the iPhone. I guess we don't know shit
4OnwUz-I2GI;this is why I love oneplus, just a damn good phone that doesn't cost both kidneys
4OnwUz-I2GI;He said this is my show so I can be bias
4OnwUz-I2GI;excuse me sir, for what smartphone driver do you use?
4OnwUz-I2GI;If you are done for 2019, can i have one phone please. From Atlanta.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm so happy you agree with me on the 7 pro being the best phone this year!!! I LOVE my 7 Pro!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus 7t pro..❣️
4OnwUz-I2GI;Admit, You're watching this because you got a new phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;i need one of them, if anyone give me? i would so happy
4OnwUz-I2GI;Y’all some haters, good job brother. I see you transcending Youtube to become a well known tech information source that brands are gonna quote in their advertising. JD powers had to start somewhere.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey marques can you give me an iphone xr
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please it could change my life😇
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pleased to see that I am not alone in wanting to KEEP the headphone jack!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;When you think Oneplus 7 pro ain't gonna win any awards but then see it win Best phone of the year
4OnwUz-I2GI;That's a years salary on his table lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;My razer phone 2 and I feel financially bullied.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me: can't even think of buying an iphone
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD: uses a different iphone 11pro for each award
4OnwUz-I2GI;To be honest… the ROG 2 should've been the MVP or at least the 2nd best as it's better than the OnePlus 7 pro in every way except the camera… and many many ppl just want a decent cam… and it delivers it nicely…
4OnwUz-I2GI;To the people 1% seeing this
4OnwUz-I2GI;Merry Christmas
4OnwUz-I2GI;and a happy new year
4OnwUz-I2GI;Always wanted to know, do you send the trophies out?
4OnwUz-I2GI;watching this from samsung s3
4OnwUz-I2GI;Yh you should send me one of those...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you plz do a basic phone tech video explaining in great detail things like ram and refresh rate
4OnwUz-I2GI;oneplus phones are much better in countries like india where the price is lower and also apple and samsung products are so much more expensive
4OnwUz-I2GI;One plus is great but when i buy a smartphone then i pay it out of my pocket so i bought a xiaomi mi 9t pro and for the rest of the money i took a Philips Smart TV
4OnwUz-I2GI;Went and bought the mvp
4OnwUz-I2GI;I am oneplus 7 pro user and I cant completely agree with @mkbhd.
4OnwUz-I2GI;3 issues -
4OnwUz-I2GI;-Google assistant wakes up for no reason and it happens quite often.
4OnwUz-I2GI;- I don't want to say there is screen lag but when your phone is not switched off over period of time ( > 2 days) it gets a little laggy.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I said I am going to change my phone if it did not win
4OnwUz-I2GI;but I am broke
4OnwUz-I2GI;still love U galaxy  Samsung S10
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus 7 Pro: *nailed the MVP*
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus ROG 2: *won 3 awards* Am i a joke to you?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I use One Plus phones. I am glad it won the MVP! I have used One Plus 3, & 5.  But I am really clumsy with my phones and always end up breaking them. I need to use a budget friendly phone where I wont have a huge loss if it falls and breaks. Thank you so much for your review and research! Very helpful!
4OnwUz-I2GI;GIve me one of those
4OnwUz-I2GI;Once again, I agree with all of these
4OnwUz-I2GI;How bout making an award for top secure phone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;It’s funny how I haven’t heard of half these phone and many have things that perform better than Android and IOS
4OnwUz-I2GI;I really want to know if he ended up shipping any of those out...
4OnwUz-I2GI;please put music next time....it feels depressing :(
4OnwUz-I2GI;Really professional review!  Studio setup is super stylish, lines, colours even the t-shirt! Well done!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can i ask what is bust when it comes in phones?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thanks in advance :)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Thank me letter

4OnwUz-I2GI;If only I could get an iphone 11 as a gift 😭
4OnwUz-I2GI;I gave up oneplus, great spec in paper but alot of problems and One of the most overrated cameras. The Samsung note is a better Choice..
4OnwUz-I2GI;why do most of these phones probably run better then my pc
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus until 21:20: Am I joke to you?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wish I had 8k monitor so I could spoil everything... But I'm almost 2 months late anyways
4OnwUz-I2GI;Imagine if the iPhone ever won the design category
4OnwUz-I2GI;So I had been looking for a new phone to swap my old Huawei Mate 9 and saw this, saw the mvp and checked to see how much it was and now I have a OnePlus 7Pro on the way.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""You hate to give out a negative award"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;The award is literally a toilet! haha
4OnwUz-I2GI;Budgetphone nr. 1 Oppo Realme x2 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love Samsung Galaxy s10 ❤❤❤❤
4OnwUz-I2GI;the fastes charging phone is realme x2 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;What ever happened to the best phone to make calls award?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 2016: Best Smartphone + Best Camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 2017: Best Camera + Runner up Best Smartphone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 2018: Best Camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 2019: Uh, it technically did get an award?
4OnwUz-I2GI;This is your own imagination
4OnwUz-I2GI;Galaxy s10: im joke to you?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wooooh wooooohh clap clap clap!! Marques in the house!
4OnwUz-I2GI;You could do a giveaway for the new year with all those phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wonder if Google actually wants the award 😅😅
4OnwUz-I2GI;hey mkbhd can i have a iphone x from u plsssss😔😞😣😣😢
4OnwUz-I2GI;Real me x2 pro is faster then oppo reno 2 in charging
4OnwUz-I2GI;noooo i pick Note 10 plus :)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best budget Phone must be the Realme X2 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bust of 2019: google pixel 4
4OnwUz-I2GI;YouTube: wait that’s illegal
4OnwUz-I2GI;I expected the Asus to get phone of the year, given how many awards it won lol. Side Note: my fave is still my Note 10+5G :-D
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you send me all of those phones hahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaha
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can i have one of those phone? Hahah
4OnwUz-I2GI;You are so rich :)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ahhh, that's hoot
4OnwUz-I2GI;why you did't included realme x2 pro in competition
4OnwUz-I2GI;Yes pls review the Huawei Mate 30 Pro AND Motorola One Hyper!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Maybe Realme x2 pro is the best budget phone of the year.

4OnwUz-I2GI;ASUS sponsor the video :(   !!!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;where is the realme x2 pro in the budget awards lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sir please give that oneplus 7pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oneplus 7 pro wins just to lower it down for you :l
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best camera but the camera doesn't have pause ⏸ option when taking videos! 😂😂😂 2019 and still they have figured out how to put pause
4OnwUz-I2GI;Should I get the iPhone 11 or xr this year? I've been on Android my whole life. I think it's time to switch it up
4OnwUz-I2GI;This guy got paid some cash, ASUS really lmao
4OnwUz-I2GI;After this video, I got a feeling if Asus would put out a non-gaming phone with same or similar specs with an improved camera in a more subdued body for 2020 they’ll have a phone that could outsell or at least compete with Samsung’s Galaxy S line.  I’ll bet the only reason it’s not a bigger seller is that the ROG styling is too aggressive for non-gamers. A sleeker Asus would KILL.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog phone 2 win 3 awards
4OnwUz-I2GI;Expect to get MVP award then....
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oneplus 7 pro show itself.
4OnwUz-I2GI;That's a million dollar table🤑
4OnwUz-I2GI;Realme x2 pro for budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm seeing redmi k20 pro on your shirt.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""Gaming"" is the tech equivalent of ""Military Grade"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Got a great deal for 1+ 7pro on white Friday. Very2x happy. Thanks to MKBHD along with other YouTube reviewers.. Happy with he unit. Thanks.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm so impressed that he had that many phones and didnt stutter to pick up any phone relevant to what he was talking about lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pls review xaiomi Mi A3
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wow I've been in the toilet for 25 minutes
4OnwUz-I2GI;I remember as a kid at school. We would have an assembly and I would never get picked for anything
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bro give a used premium phone plz.. I can't afford but I need a premium phone for mobile Photography 😥😥
4OnwUz-I2GI;i also have the oneplus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;I've had the Galaxy S10e since release and I couldn't be happier with it, I love the size and flat screen along with a ton of other features, I must say it's a beast of a phone and I've been getting updates quicker than I expected, running Android 10 since early December on T-Mobile, I feel like Samsung is stepping up in that department, all around a great device, I definitely would recommend, I'll be using this for as long as possible.

4OnwUz-I2GI;For me the best affordable phone is iphone 11. I’ve been using it and my experience is awesome.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Remember when OnePlus wasn't widely available to buy. They've come a very long way since then
4OnwUz-I2GI;Its very sad that real me x2 pro couldnt made it to this list...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wow so much smartphones and crazy designs...
4OnwUz-I2GI;You are smart and creative marques
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please review the Sony Xperia 1 Mark ii...And compared it with other flagships
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think that google at start a was really interested in releasing phones and creating hype but nowadays that just do it because they have to it
4OnwUz-I2GI;imagine being an alien and see us do smartphone awards
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus 7 Pro or ASUS ROG Phone 2?
4OnwUz-I2GI;He really loves the iphone... Jumping on that iphone bandwagon as always
4OnwUz-I2GI;Nice i find my next phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I will buy oneplus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;3:55 nice wallpaper bro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'd buy the Asus but the design is not my style, they should make a simple aluminum design for non gamers, I don't mind the light up logo
4OnwUz-I2GI;bruh imagin buying a gameing phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;What happened to the realme x2 pro 😱😱😱
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where are the Xiaomi and the Realme at man? And the Oppo Reno 2?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Always a one plus, Samsung, iPhone huge fan for an obvious reason!!!?
4OnwUz-I2GI;This is possibly the most nerdy yet rich af video ever
4OnwUz-I2GI;What weather app is that @ 1:37
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD out here having trophies for smartphones while I am still hoping to afford one. Ultimate flex.
4OnwUz-I2GI;That's a lot of phone just for one person hahahab
4OnwUz-I2GI;One thing to note is that samsung is in every category 😂😂😂.... The Samsung R&D team is the best
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""But hey, it's my show. So I can be biased"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;MVP--------oneplus as always
4OnwUz-I2GI;I feel that the Asus ROG phone 2 is a bit underrated tbh - checked A TON of boxes for a decent price, including some best in class.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Waiting For OP 8!! 🙂
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching this on my iphone 11 pro max and listening to this on my airpod pros lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;Good phones are getting expensive
4OnwUz-I2GI;Cheap phones are getting good - MKBHD
4OnwUz-I2GI;Moast of those phones never heard of them in 🇩🇪
4OnwUz-I2GI;This is peak awesomeness. I’ve seen a bunch of videos comparing all of those phones to the iPhone 11 Pro. While this isn’t too in depth as the individual reviews and comparisons, you took hours of content and shortened it 25 mins.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"There were five phones that stood out, but the Rog Phone 2 impressed me the most. Thanks for uploading this. I can’t wait for the 2020 awards ;)"
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me : how many phones u have ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques : more than hair u can  count on your head !!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hopefully this will become a huge show in the future just like the game award
4OnwUz-I2GI;Dang.. I just bought the pixel 4xl and I see it's the bust of the year. Goddamn
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about redmi note 10 pro.. i heard it has a 100+mp.. i know that it depends on the software too.. but 100+mp..!!👀
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wow. So the s10 and the note 10 cant even get a honourable mention
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hopefully i got one of this device but its just a dream for me cus im a poor boy huhu just commemting hopefully he will gave one of those phone to me as a give aways ::(
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google is never going to call you at their events now😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;you need an audience!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;best smart phone video camera?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just upload anything, what the hell are you doing these days ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Proud owner of the MVP right here
4OnwUz-I2GI;He always looks so lonely in those videos
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just by himself with this suit and those phones and that camera, it looks like he's the only man in the universe
4OnwUz-I2GI;he emphasised headphone jack
4OnwUz-I2GI;You should check out Realme x2 pro for budget segment
4OnwUz-I2GI;lol someone ran by at 3:57
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google - this kid(MKBHD) is the best reviewer .......
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD- pixel phone is the biggest bust of the year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;2018: OnePlus 6T
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019: OnePlus 7 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;send me one hhhhh
4OnwUz-I2GI;No realme x2 pro in budget???
4OnwUz-I2GI;So what's the best low light / night time Android camera?
4OnwUz-I2GI;What is the name of the app he is using at 1:39?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who else thought the iphone 11 pro transition was sick
4OnwUz-I2GI;you forgot the best gaming phone award! Because that's a thing now...RIGHT?
4OnwUz-I2GI;edit: I won 3 awards on ROG 2 LOL
4OnwUz-I2GI;We all know that Mi 9T PRO is the king of 2019 :) event that MKBHD got a faulty one.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lol MKBHD Don't know about realme X2 pro!Realme X2 pro should be the best budget winner
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog phone 2 winning 3 awards , a phone people can afford 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;woah, that is a lot of phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog 2 give away plss
4OnwUz-I2GI;He's just sitting there with 25.000$ in front of him😐
4OnwUz-I2GI;I chuckled a little bit when he said iPhone 11 was the runner up for most improved. They change one to two things every drop and call it game changing🤣🤣
4OnwUz-I2GI;"MKBHD: ""s10+ sets the bar for any smartphone coming in 2019, a great all-rounder"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;"also MKBHD: ""Pixel 3A is a honorable mention for the best  over all smartphone of the year"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;...bruh
4OnwUz-I2GI;mi a3 in my country 179euros with 64gb is cheapest best, change my mind
4OnwUz-I2GI;how come no sony xperia?
4OnwUz-I2GI;How can the iPhone 11 wins the best camera, when on your image challenge the winner was the Samsung Note 10?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Plz give a me a phone😭😭
4OnwUz-I2GI;When are u gonna invite us subscribers in your “MKBHD Smartphone Awards Event” ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;in the thumbnail he shows the s10(clickbait)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bro do you use real me if you did you would neaver pick google as the second best buget smart phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;The royal flex pie
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: I'm not going sugar coat that one, it's not like we expected this to be good.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Damn man😁😁
4OnwUz-I2GI;Display
4OnwUz-I2GI;RAM
4OnwUz-I2GI;Camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;(s)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Fast charging/Battery
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who else wishes that Asus would make a clean, sleek version of their phone with the same specs? Honestly would make for an incredible phone because I feel like many people are turned off by how much it screams 'gaming'.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you give me a phone??...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Man your reviews are bs crap. Just kidding. :P
4OnwUz-I2GI;Actually, these reviews are the most honest I've seen, BUT... the 2016 totally disqualified the Note 7 on the explosion hazard. lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;Consider adding an additional category award - best phone for working professionals utility wise...as every company keeps naming there phone pro and it decided the size variants compatibility at the work front
4OnwUz-I2GI;"There should be an award for the category for the best budget phone or  ""value for money"" too 🙄😁🤔"
4OnwUz-I2GI;I really thought the S10 would win the best battery and design award lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;That's a great song on the intro. Betablock3r is da sheetz.
4OnwUz-I2GI;We need awards for tablets also
4OnwUz-I2GI;World best charging phone is realms X2 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD said Pixel 4 was the worst phone of the year, which shows his credibility and how he doesn't care what big companies think about him. Good job man and we love you.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Tbh if the rog phone 3 had a rly good camera, it would probably be the best phone of 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;How could one plus 7 pro be the best smartphone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;It doesn't have ip certification,  wireless charging neither an headphone jack...🤔😖
4OnwUz-I2GI;How much apple pay you to not mention the Nokia Pureview for the best camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;where is realme x2 pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;That table itself costs more than me
4OnwUz-I2GI;using OP7T, never looked back
4OnwUz-I2GI;Damn. This dude dressed up and everything.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"You forgot a winner for ""best display"" - that's a big one!"
4OnwUz-I2GI;iPhone 11pro & 11 beats every shit called android phone on that table. end of convo! 😎
4OnwUz-I2GI;I’m actually surprised knowing you that you didn’t say that the bust of the year was the LG G8 ThinQ
4OnwUz-I2GI;AGAIN ...
4OnwUz-I2GI;"ONE PLUS ... WINS THE ""MVP"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best battery life: Oppo Reno Ace
4OnwUz-I2GI;At some point in the video it looked like i could see the phones thinking:' Don't chosoe me! or Choose me!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Summary(SPOILER ALERT)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Big phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;1st - Rog phone 2
4OnwUz-I2GI;A-zeus? Lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best display phone ?😢
4OnwUz-I2GI;I’m very interested in buying one plus 7 pro but also like to buy iphone 11 coz I’m an iphone user..uhmm I’m confused 🤷🏻‍♀️ I need a good battery 🔋 I don’t care abt the camera 📸 quality coz I believe in beauty edit apps 😅 ......so, which is the better option???
4OnwUz-I2GI;Meanwhile I have xiaomi for about $100
4OnwUz-I2GI;Holy sweet God, was waiting for the Smart Phone of the Year and One Plus 7 Pro is the Winner 😊😊❤️
4OnwUz-I2GI;I would  like to see a smartphone award of phones that you can buy through a carrier.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Write the name on screen also , like i didnt get the first phone name
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best camera in smartphone is Samsung S10+
4OnwUz-I2GI;Runner up for the best budget phone should have been Realme X2 pro¯\_ಠ_ಠ_/¯
4OnwUz-I2GI;Now imagine having to charge all of those phones.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hoping you will me one of em😔
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think that the realme X2 pro should be a honourable mention in your budget pick
4OnwUz-I2GI;OP 7 pro didn't got a single award for particular specs
4OnwUz-I2GI;Still the smartphone of the year
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm still using a 2015 model phone. Just here to show love and support.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ok done, oneplus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;watched on a Oneplus7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Honeey next year we need drag queens!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ehm.. i still love Google Pixel 4 more than any other phone on the table :-P
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Marques: ""MVP: Oneplus 7 Pro"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Jonathan Morrison and iJustine: ""aight imma gonna head out"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think you should include the best display categorie
4OnwUz-I2GI;what's the app name 1:37 ???
4OnwUz-I2GI;MY PHONE WON A REWARD!!!!! YESSSSS
4OnwUz-I2GI;ASUS really hurt themselves by not making the ROG phone Verizon certified. Most importantly, they hurt me.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have the ROG Phone 2, and I can tell you from experience that all the other phones on that table are booty compared to this thing
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ok so you arent a paid off bias when. Did you have time to actually use all of these phones for any period of time
4OnwUz-I2GI;Top 3 phones of 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;1. S10/10+
4OnwUz-I2GI;2. Huawei p30 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;review the motorola please
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can I get one of those? Mines trash 😂😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;No matter the differences of all smartphones  they all have one thing in common, they all scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7
4OnwUz-I2GI;my phone won the mvp
4OnwUz-I2GI;Isn't in the USA any Xiaomi smartphone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;You have so many phones, pls give me an iPhone 11 Pro Max. It's gonna be a perfect birthday gift for me. I'm from the Philippines.
4OnwUz-I2GI;My note 10 plus is the best smartphone out there tbh
4OnwUz-I2GI;Elon Musk: we will live on mars in a couple of decades!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: so I have been living on the mars since 2004 and here are my thoughts
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on my 7T just happy to be part of the honorable mention squad 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wanna know what phone he uses from that table normally
4OnwUz-I2GI;Made my day! And this time its our 7. My OnePlus 7 Pro ❤️
4OnwUz-I2GI;You really need to get your hands on the Realme phones. Could easily win Best budget phone and Best battery. I am taking about X2 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Jonathon Morrison is murmuring “iPhone” to himself watching this video after every award is announced
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rip p30 users
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can I have one?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sponsored by
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus Phone 2
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey Mr. What's your daily phone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Oneplus has won the last two ""phone of the year"" awards, they're killing it 😎"
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was waiting for you to make mention of OnePlus 7 pro from the start, not know you have a better piece of the award for it. You got it right. Oneplus 7 pro and 7t are the best of 2019. Well done.
4OnwUz-I2GI;i was wondering if you dropped the phone while picking it up
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love the 10e
4OnwUz-I2GI;what happen to your left eye
4OnwUz-I2GI;It'd probably be better to start with runner-up winners than the actual winner per category for better flow, because we end up going:
4OnwUz-I2GI;Winner
4OnwUz-I2GI;But here's the runner up
4OnwUz-I2GI;The Xperia 1 should of gotten a honourable mention for the most improved since it was  better in every single way than the previous phones Sony made.
4OnwUz-I2GI;IPhone pro 11 has best camera in 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;"2020 samsung galaxy s20 ""im gonna end this guys whole career."
4OnwUz-I2GI;you should do the one plus 8
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bought the OnePlus 7 Pro on Black Friday, and totally agree it's the best.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus has crushed them all!!! That's an amazing achievement in the smartphone industry.
4OnwUz-I2GI;What phone does Marques use??
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wow it really changed fast 10 years ago you could take pictures with your phone and be impressed now ur phone is a camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wonder what he's done with all his old phones?

4OnwUz-I2GI;Imessage, a camera, need i say more?? Im buying the 11 pro this weekend.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I am curious, are you sending those plaque/trophies to their winning brand offices?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques is so much on the iphones. Actually I have seen nothing  special about iphones in the whole of 2019!
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think note 10 plus was phone of the year

4OnwUz-I2GI;Very realistic smartphone awards this year, i agree with mostly everything you've said. Well done!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus 6z should've won the best selfie camera and innovative design

4OnwUz-I2GI;Those smartphones just laying there, not being called is me in real life. I just exist
4OnwUz-I2GI;For God's sake, Verizon... pay ASUS to make a CDMA variant!
4OnwUz-I2GI;I am shocked that S10 plus or 5G didn't even come to his mouth.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus has climb back to the top while Nokia is still floating somewhere
4OnwUz-I2GI;Been carrying around a super crappy phone for a hot minute, this was just the video I needed. Wish me luck out there buyin shit boiiii

4OnwUz-I2GI;@t
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus is still the MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;Excuse me did I just hear him call these GLASS SANDWICHES
4OnwUz-I2GI;I want all of them
4OnwUz-I2GI;I bet Google intentionally wanted to get bust of the year so they could increase their chances on getting the most improved phone of the year next year... As well as other awards.. hopefully...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Samsung galaxy note 10 plus, S10 plus, Huawei P30 Pro, Mate 30 pro, IPhone 11 pro, pixel 4, but......
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oneplus 7t pro Why winner is 7 pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;When your phone is not even on the Table?
4OnwUz-I2GI;The best buget phone is the realmeX2pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;untuk saya iphone 11 pro nya pak? aku mohon, saya sangat ingin sekali beli itu tapi uang belum cukup
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques, a stock Android and big Pixel fan, giving the bust of the year award to the Pixel 4, just further proves and shows he gives honest unbiased reviews. This is why I love his videos.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Also, that toilet trophy for bust of the year, hahahaha 😂😂😂.
4OnwUz-I2GI;12:51:00 AM
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus 7t pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Did Sony get any coverage this year?
4OnwUz-I2GI;What do you think is the best phone of the year and why?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Did anyone else wait for their favorite phone to win 😂.
4OnwUz-I2GI;The best  rugged phone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Did anyone ask for their trophy?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just get an iPhone lmao
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey, Still using Samsung Galaxy Alpha, thinking about upgrading
4OnwUz-I2GI;He feels so bad a out having a ' bust of the year' award because he's such a nice guy! Such a rare quality in Internet celebrities
4OnwUz-I2GI;Was the Samsung Galaxy a20e in this video??
4OnwUz-I2GI;When you watch this with a 4 years old phone... (S7edge 😅) You could do a category best old phone or something becuse my Galaxy s7 edge is garbage now its constantly lagging and updates are coming every once all planets align perfectly 😒😑 840 euros for not even 4 years? I will pay 1k for phone if they do guarantee a life circle more then 3 4 years! 😒
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who else wonders what phone he actually has
4OnwUz-I2GI;do you ever say anything negative about apple, like their cables and slow adaption to customer needs. Or are you just blind.
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD : How many awards do you want
4OnwUz-I2GI;ROG 2 : YE5
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wonder how many companies asked for the award to be sent to them lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;How many companies wanted their physical awards this time around?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Didn't anybody notice he got some sort of make-up for this video
4OnwUz-I2GI;Waterproof is one of the more important factors for me...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: I got this phone late
4OnwUz-I2GI;The comments: IMPOSSIBLE
4OnwUz-I2GI;No iPhone has a good battery, so it doesn't get any rewards in that area. Huawei is better by 100%
4OnwUz-I2GI;How is a 700$ one plus 7t a budget phone???
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why did you select one plus 7 pro over 7t pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei P30 Pro best!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Then there’s me with my 6 year old samsung s5
4OnwUz-I2GI;Been using the pixel 4XL for past week. Best device I've ever used.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog 3 awards... Wow
4OnwUz-I2GI;ROG takes pictures like mid range phone from 2016
4OnwUz-I2GI;ROG was like Parasite on Oscar 2020, big win!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey marques can you please take a photo of the phones from above in 4k for wallpaper please
4OnwUz-I2GI;why did you underestimate the Mate 30 pro ?!
4OnwUz-I2GI;"It's weird how the Note 10+ got so much shit for it's ""just okay"" camera in professional reviews, but won a bunch of blind tests."
4OnwUz-I2GI;can i have one phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have Oneplus 7 Pro 5G and i'm so disappointed with it. No Android update until March 2020.
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD: “It is clear that there is something for everyone still” ☝️👌 min: 24:24
4OnwUz-I2GI;Unfortunately s10 didn't get a single award :(
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best Selling Smartphone for 2019 goes to Samsung Galaxy A10 ❤
4OnwUz-I2GI;My Oneplus 7 Pro agrees with this video
4OnwUz-I2GI;Does he smash them like m&m ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watched this on my OnePlus 7 hoping it to be mentioned somewhere.. disappointed..
4OnwUz-I2GI;i cant agree with software update comment about Rkog
4OnwUz-I2GI;Did any companies ask for their rewards? If so can you tell us which ones?
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Don't laugh but.. if ""budget"" phones are 300.00 to 450.00"
4OnwUz-I2GI;What the hell are the 99.00 to 150.00 phones called?
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Asus: ""won three awards"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus got none
4OnwUz-I2GI;"OnePlus: ""wins best phone"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus: that's illegal
4OnwUz-I2GI;Nobody talking about the UFS 3.0 on the OnePlus 7 Pro. Such an underrated feature, its so incredibly fast.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bought the OnePlus 7 Pro because it was on sale at a local shop. Can't believe it won the overall! Nice! Amazing phone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about ZTE Axon 10 Pro? It also has wireless charging, which OnePlus does not have.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is galaxy s10?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I bought the OnePlus 7 Pro earlier this year and yeah the cameras are not the best but I LOVE it so much.  I'm glad to see someone finally cover this phone for how good it is!
4OnwUz-I2GI;i beg to differ, though i highly agree the biggest Bust of the year goes to the Pixel4, It IS the worst phone for the money in 2019..
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei Mate X?
4OnwUz-I2GI;As of right now Jan 2020, the OnePlus 7 pro starts at 500$. So it's a great phone in the almost budget range.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I agree on all of those but the best phone for the camera is the Huawei p30 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;*watches at 8k
4OnwUz-I2GI;*Zooms at the trophies in the back
4OnwUz-I2GI;*Saved 10 minutes and knows all winners
4OnwUz-I2GI;Yikes, nothing for the S10?
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Where's the ""Best Rugged Smartphone"" award??? Definitely the Cubot Quest. Love mine so much I bought a second one to replace my wife's iPhone; finally she is back to the Light Side of the Force.  I would like to hear your opinion of the Cubot Quest."
4OnwUz-I2GI;For next year do honorable mention/runner up first and then the winner. That way you speak last one whichever phone is the winner rather than having to go back
4OnwUz-I2GI;Help me! Should I get op 7 pro or 7T!??? I’m looking for best performance gaming and overral rounder.
4OnwUz-I2GI;My s10e is actually  winning  something  ,  represent.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Note 10?????
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sony makes the cameras for iPhone i think
4OnwUz-I2GI;You are the best!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Note 10 plus only getting a runner up to an unimportant award?? really??
4OnwUz-I2GI;I missed the days when people from different phone camps fought each other.
4OnwUz-I2GI;basically rog phone 2 is the billie eilish of the smartphones
4OnwUz-I2GI;No Nokia 9 for photography? It can do miracles that no other smartphone, let alone device(Even DSLR lack especially at price point of $400) can't.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I thought that you are all about substance, not just flashy brand BS.
4OnwUz-I2GI;For the battery life I should tell you about the honor 9x pro. I can reach 2 days normal use battery from a full charge...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Got the 7t Pro McLaren over the Note 10+ I really liked the idea of the Stylus and square screen but I think I made the right choice. And I was too impatient to wait for the s20 Ultra (plus that $$$)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bought asus rog phone 2 cause it felt felt best at the price they were selling at and could have been an MVP mention but I appreciate that 1+7 pro got MVP and i totally get the facts that why he chose that one, but I still think rog Phone 2 should have been an honorable mention in MVP lineup. All the best and Merry Christmas to all in advance.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you do best software for 2020 (this year) for the smartphone awards?
4OnwUz-I2GI;This will be great for people that don't care about  hardware but care about ease of use, useful features, and software longevity
4OnwUz-I2GI;Dude next year you should include  the  durability award, since phones keep on gettin more expensive every year, it's  better  to buy a durable  phone so that u don't  get to buy another  one a year after.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Are you giving any of those phones away? I'll take the S10
4OnwUz-I2GI;i have a oneplus7t
4OnwUz-I2GI;In my opinion, OnePlus 7 Pro, which now is on sale for $500, is simply the best value right now, for covering just about every basic fundamentals very well, even if not the best of the best at everything.  
4OnwUz-I2GI;As for the Pixel 4, it seriously deserved the bust of the year for the atrocity that it was.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Apple bought you
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sony win 🕊
4OnwUz-I2GI;surprised the OnePlus 7t didn't get an hon mention for the best battery if he was highlighting charging for runners up, but then again I never heard of the oppo
4OnwUz-I2GI;please can i have a iphone 11 pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;please
4OnwUz-I2GI;he just called me broke in 2019 languages
4OnwUz-I2GI;Did you have to buy all the phones?
4OnwUz-I2GI;you are too much on the apple products side , which will affect the honesty of your review .
4OnwUz-I2GI;What is the UI he uses in every phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;i wed just buy I 10 if I was gonna get 11 I was  just gonna get the pro max if I want to get 11
4OnwUz-I2GI;This was so fair than anything else. I'm really impressed with the arrangements for these awards. I'm not a gamer but my ROG 2 removed the S10 plus from my pocket. The battery, the speakers, the audio, and the cool display. Asus put in the white on the display so that you can see the display clearly even with lower brightness. The speakers and the audio equalizers are the best I've used. You can clearly notice the difference with each one. The indoors lighting is the only drawback for the cameras on this phone. Don't take out for programs or parties where you expect to take pictures.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I’m going to be honest I have no idea what you are talking about with the phone stuff
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where do chocolate people come from?
4OnwUz-I2GI;damn i’ve always loved apple but they do tend to release boring phones ever since the 7, but the 11 series is a really great balance of everything imo
4OnwUz-I2GI;I thought that the bust of the year is huawuei mate 30
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who else's phone isnt even in the video?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Are you a Nigerian?
4OnwUz-I2GI;how much all those phone costs when they bought?? Around 35000$?
4OnwUz-I2GI;..and how much they worth??
4OnwUz-I2GI;@mkbhd
4OnwUz-I2GI;S10 is the best.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Samsung
4OnwUz-I2GI;Iphone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei
4OnwUz-I2GI;DID ANYONE MENTIONED THE TOILET THING IN 7:00
4OnwUz-I2GI;2020: The year of $700 budget phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog phone 2 for £400
4OnwUz-I2GI;When you're such a sellout that you give iPhone the best camera award yet the note 10 won the blind test.
4OnwUz-I2GI;BS Award
4OnwUz-I2GI;No huawei?
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Best part of OnePlus is ""Oxygen OS"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;I completely agree with the oneplus selection.. Very objective.. Thumbs up mate
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ridiculous...c'mon made his own rewards🤦
4OnwUz-I2GI;I am SHOOK
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think the samsung A50 was the best budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Imagine being able to chose everything that goes into ur phone screen res size battery size and os and even camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;Crying in S7 Edge
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why you did not include the Realme x2 Pro? it should have been the winner of the  budget phone of the year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Don't know why everyone snubs LG, but I just traded my S10e in for a LG G8. The S10e has better speakers, but aside from that the Lg completely outclasses the Galaxy.
4OnwUz-I2GI;But I still want iPhone 11 pro max
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD: *announce bust of the year
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google: We feel personally attacked
4OnwUz-I2GI;I didn't see no Razer phone, What's up with that?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Now i know This guy is paid by Apple.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Do u like walk in to switch the cameras on then go out and walk in again.?. Im asking for someone
4OnwUz-I2GI;S20 Ultra for 2020 ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus rog 2 is fully nailed it and it get total 3 award 1 . Big phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;                       2. best battery
4OnwUz-I2GI;                              3. Best successor
4OnwUz-I2GI;Shout out to Asus for making such an awesome phone for gaming.😎
4OnwUz-I2GI;I've got the Samsung s10e. For its size, the thing's a powerhouse. I got tired of these behemoth phones that were annoying to use one handed. The s10e is compact, has a great camera, fantastic screen, expandable memory, and best of all, the headphone jack. Good job Samsung.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sellout
4OnwUz-I2GI;Does apple pay or endorse your channel?
4OnwUz-I2GI;So if the Oppo Reno Ace charges from 0% to 100% in about 30 minutes, it will charge 1% every 19 seconds. Woah
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oaaaa
4OnwUz-I2GI;How did the Motorollo g7 Power not get a mention in the best battery review? It's battery is amazing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Are u goin to giveaway any of these Phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;I use oneplus7T, is there anyone else?
4OnwUz-I2GI;nobody:
4OnwUz-I2GI;mkbhd: so i’ve been celebrating christmas for about 2 weeks now
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have the pixal 4 XL
4OnwUz-I2GI;This guy has sick reviews
4OnwUz-I2GI;how was iphone 11 not even an honorable mention for budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'd have mentioned the Motorola Razr as a design runner up
4OnwUz-I2GI;After the 10M reveal, need to start saying: I'm your host, Marques Kieth Brownlee
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei already had the Ultra-Wide Cam.
4OnwUz-I2GI;why didn't he reviewed the Black shark 2??
4OnwUz-I2GI;👌👌👌
4OnwUz-I2GI;Realme x2 pro vs k20 pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Biggest, baddest flagship this year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;            -MKBHD 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;ياريت لو تترجم الفيديو للعربي
4OnwUz-I2GI;Smartphone of the year should be Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 👑👑
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is P30 pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;watching this on my iPhone 11.not disappointed.
4OnwUz-I2GI;The iPhone 11 Pro and Pixel 4 is no surprise for me in the camera category.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Was hoping he would mention how the Pixel 4 lost in benchmark tests to the Pixel 3.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Great
4OnwUz-I2GI;Remember OnePlus is made in China CPC
4OnwUz-I2GI;dude that's like $50,000 worth of phones all on one desk
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just bought my brother the pixel 3a because he needed a new phone but he hates spending so much money on these expensive phones so I told him this is the best phone for the money and guess what?-thank you Marques
4OnwUz-I2GI;Well I don't understand the concept of gaming phones it's stupidity to make an overall gaming phone....
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best budget 500$ phone ... yeah
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can give me the iPhone 11 Pro Max
4OnwUz-I2GI;When you think your phone is not getting any trophies but he wins the MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus did it
4OnwUz-I2GI;Atleast their should be an award for Samsung S10 plus and HUAWEI P30 pro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about s10+???
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey guys I need help. For my birthday I'm getting a new phone and I dont know if I should wait for s20 or iphone 11 pro max. I dont know if I should wait 3 months for s20 or should I just go to verizon and pick up a 11 pro max. Any suggestions?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please agree, best default camera phone =pixel4xl 😢😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;"The most unnecessary phone of 2019: ""OnePlus 7T Pro""."
4OnwUz-I2GI;How did the Nokia 9 pureview not win the camera category? It's got the best camera setup of 2019 when it comes to quality
4OnwUz-I2GI;Moto z series???? Ouch. Underated phones.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you buy the Redmi K20 phone in the the U.S.?  What size is it, and what carrier supports it?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques why do you give away of these phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;For Motorola one hyper review. Like this comment.
4OnwUz-I2GI;The Pixel 3a shouldn’t even be runner up for budget phone as you can buy a Xiaomi mi 8 for like $290 which you can then install lineage os and a direct port of the pixel 3’s Gcam for a debatably better Pixel 3 non a
4OnwUz-I2GI;I want that Google pixel 4 XL
4OnwUz-I2GI;ROG 2got so many awards??? It should also won the most ugly phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;ROG Phone won 3 awards when no other phone won even 2. Phone manufacturers could learn a lot from Asus.
4OnwUz-I2GI;You should have also included
4OnwUz-I2GI;MOST UNDERRATED SMARTPHONE OF THE YEAR...
4OnwUz-I2GI;I can easily do day and a half or maybe even two with my iPhone 11 Pro Max. A little misleading statement at that category?
4OnwUz-I2GI;300$ and 400$ for budget phones...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why are those budget phones twice my budget...
4OnwUz-I2GI;How come no huawei x
4OnwUz-I2GI;The reasons why Marques has 10 million subs:
4OnwUz-I2GI;- not bias
4OnwUz-I2GI;- great quality
4OnwUz-I2GI;- awesome film and photography skills
4OnwUz-I2GI;the apple bias tho
4OnwUz-I2GI;What would happen if all these companies come together to make a phone that has all those features?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bro u have too many phone, what u will do with all these ? Why don't u send me Samsung note 10+ 😜😆
4OnwUz-I2GI;Biggest rip off award: iPhone 11 / 11 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think the note 10 plus had the best camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;Nice video...1plus always no 1
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oneplus comes from China Redmi Comes from China Huawei Comes from China Oppo comes from China
4OnwUz-I2GI;I want the ROG sooooo bad
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me not having none of those phones is like:All of them deserve a award.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think you should have add huawei p30 pro too.
4OnwUz-I2GI;And a Huawei phone never got any. The leader in Innovation and new ideas.
4OnwUz-I2GI;...and once again, OnePlus is mvp 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;my phone was last year’s mvp lmao
4OnwUz-I2GI;Galaxy fold is just a gimmick phone !!!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Smartphone Award is my favorite video all the time for every single year on your channel!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Congrats to OnePlus for be MVP 2019. Also congrats Asus ROG, you make so much improved this year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei p30 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus won for me. ROG Phone II crushes those mainstream phones for breakfast.
4OnwUz-I2GI;for my iPhone 11 Pro, sir? I beg of you, I really want to buy that but not enough money
4OnwUz-I2GI;im using the iphone 11 and its battery isnt all that amazing but still a good phone, even if it gets hot for no reason
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 3a is a honorable mention for smartphone of the year and PIXEL 4 is trash...I think that says a lot about what your best at Google please get focus on what your customers want
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where the LG G8X  dual screen at
4OnwUz-I2GI;Not a single mention or award for the Red Magic 3s is like not even acknowledging Joaquin Phoenix for Joker.  It is if nothing less equal to the Rog 2.
4OnwUz-I2GI;That bust award for google pixel 4 was so satisfying. Plus all those google ads. So bad.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can anyone pls tell me waht would be the price of oneplus 7 pro in 2022 pls i seriously want it
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think you should split the design award to 2 separate awards, design award and innovation award. The Samsung Galaxy Fold may be the most innovative, but in my opinion, did not have the best design.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""This is not a good phone to hold with one or two hands?"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Well crap, guess that rules me out.
4OnwUz-I2GI;People have a different definition to me of the word 'budget'.
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD x OnePlus Limited edition phone is coming in 2020
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus 7pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Now all these companies gonna use this award in advertisements
4OnwUz-I2GI;"I'd like to see a category for most future-proof budget phone or longest lifespan budget phone - e.g. most likely to last the longest in terms of battery capacity and lifetime (battery charge and temperature management), software updates, processor and memory specs, upgrade-ability to battery and other components (modular design?), and expandable memory.  I include ""budget"" because it's too easy to say get the highest spec phone like the Asus ROG 2."
4OnwUz-I2GI;What do you think about appo a9
4OnwUz-I2GI;Biggest screen = Galaxy Fold
4OnwUz-I2GI;Samsung note 10 plus should get at least mentioned in all categories.  And This is the best phone of 2019 .
4OnwUz-I2GI;You should ship Pixel 4's award to Google anyway as a constant reminder. I never knew I would say this, but they should take a page out of Apple's book and start to actually listen to their customers.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I get triggered every time he says the IPhone 11 Instead of Pro Max in the battery
4OnwUz-I2GI;"WTF is with those ""runner ups"" and the ""winners""!?"
4OnwUz-I2GI;To be honest smartphone in 2019 doesn't surprise me I hope 2020 will do better
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can someone help me decide on either the p30, lgg8 or Samsung s10e ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bruh Samsung won/got so many honorable mentions...what a year for Sammy! Not to mention that beast of a phone, the Asus ROG phone 2 (single handedly carried the company). And Apple's iPhones were great too this year! One of the best ones in a while.
4OnwUz-I2GI;why do all budget phones have a letter beside its name
4OnwUz-I2GI;bagi bagi anjg
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lemme guess. Smartphone of the year 2020 ....
4OnwUz-I2GI;.
4OnwUz-I2GI;.
4OnwUz-I2GI;.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm surprised the Samsung A50 didn't make the budget entry.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Is it just me or did smartphone video comment sections get a lot less toxic since last year?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I just bought a pixel 4xl lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;👍
4OnwUz-I2GI;The a20e was $169
4OnwUz-I2GI;iPhone 11 Pro’s front camera is as good as the other 3 🤩
4OnwUz-I2GI;If this was a normal awards show there'd be ad breaks and new phone reveals during the show.
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about the s10 plus
4OnwUz-I2GI;The best design for me was the Motorola razor. bust of the yr Nokia 9
4OnwUz-I2GI;R u kidding me? U forgot Huawei P30Pro!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where's LG g8s thinq?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm happy that my phone was even in this video although I'm not surprised because I own Samsung Galaxy S10e
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me wondering why y9s isn't in here
4OnwUz-I2GI;I don't know whether I fell asleep but how can you omit best phone for audio. You're not catering for audiophiles.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best mobile name plz reply
4OnwUz-I2GI;Other than an iPhone, What is the best cellphone to buy today?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on my the OnePlus 7 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;honestly dissapointed he didn't say anything for s10 plus. headphone jack monster battery cameras were solid new never seen punch hole kinda sad about it
4OnwUz-I2GI;U can give me any one of them  i won't mind
4OnwUz-I2GI;you give all the trophy's to the Asus Rog phone 2 but it's not the winner please explaine why it isn't the winner
4OnwUz-I2GI;Does he send the trophies to the winning phones' manufacturers?
4OnwUz-I2GI;When you can't afford any of them 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is the Huawei mate30pro??
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei P30 Pro got nothing ????
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is the realmex2pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;basically the redmi K20 pro  is the one .
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love the Oneplus 7 plus, but I bought the 7T and I really don't regret it, it's amazing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;What happens to all the phones you don't use?
4OnwUz-I2GI;So Asus and apple paid you big, my phone lasts 4 days or more and has a better camera, display and sound than iphone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hail asus
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ammmm.... plz dont do this again
4OnwUz-I2GI;Biggest disappointment of 2019 - Huawei getting shafted on Android a month after releasing the P30 Pro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I phone is anyways the best for me
4OnwUz-I2GI;It's 2020 and you're giving best phone award to a phone that doesn't have wireless charging and has no water proofing rating.. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lmao apple keeps the same shitty specs on both their bigger and smaller phones that's nothing to reward xD
4OnwUz-I2GI;So the Note 10 plus won the blind camera test but iphone still got the win for best camera ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marquez should create an actual tech awards show. We seriously need one of those to up the competition from everyone. Also a great opportunity to introduce more tech. Kinda like the game awards. I’d watch for sure
4OnwUz-I2GI;Mkbhd best battery goes to asus rog
4OnwUz-I2GI;Samsung galaxy m30s be like.....ohh what am i to you anyway my 6000mah battery,super amoled display,8nm midrange chip, dark mode jzz last 5 min after all🙄🙄.....
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ugh. Samsung. Gross. Samsung released over 9000 phones in 2019.
4OnwUz-I2GI;You should mail the awards to the companies
4OnwUz-I2GI;Which phone u are using right now ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;The quality of this channel just keeps going up
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD you should really expand on the budget phone category. Non-flagships need recognition for what they're doing too, that's why you included so many runner-ups. Give best design, best camera, and most improved, biggest bust, and so on, maybe even best hardware/software. Kudos on encouraging compact phones too, they're really important.
4OnwUz-I2GI;ONEPLUS THE BEST!!!!!!! NEVER SETTLE
4OnwUz-I2GI;anyone else wondering how many iphone 11 pros he has on that table?
4OnwUz-I2GI;What iPad is just like iPad Pro except cheaper?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I imagine him as a rapper in another universe
4OnwUz-I2GI;People nowadays are addicted to their phones?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sortea un broo jaja me ace falta no me puedo pagar uno mi hermano es tan mi grabé en el ospital
4OnwUz-I2GI;Spoilers :
4OnwUz-I2GI;The best camera smartphone which still has an outdated 240fps slo mo😑
4OnwUz-I2GI;one plus 7pro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
4OnwUz-I2GI;If you watch the first 15 seconds of this video you'll immediately understand that Marques made it as a tech reviewer.
4OnwUz-I2GI;It looks like your bout to play solitaire 😂😂😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;Alright...who else was nervous at 15:12 that Marques would pick your phone for bust of the year?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Give me one of those😔
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can you please tell me what is the best affordable phone with 128gb of internal storage. Thanks.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why u skipped Realme X2 Pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;s10 GANG 👍👍
4OnwUz-I2GI;(11 pro max owner)
4OnwUz-I2GI;hmm , this guy is a genius on mobile phones...and very professional vid...im amazed...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lile a lg v50 or g8x or s, 😫😫😒😒 specially the v50 have a ton of good stuff for media consumer or editions tools.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was using ROG Phone II, and watched this video on it while winning few awards. Right after I watched this vid, I happened to put the phone on my car, and drove away. The phone dropped and got hit by car. I haven't realize it yet for few hours, but the phone was still alive and I did track the phone and found it. The phone front and rear's glass crushed, but still working. Salute to the phone, I might just need to replace the glasses.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Come on... How can you forget about LG G8X Dual.. That should be new design in a budget...
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have galaxy Note 10 +5G aura blue its the best :(
4OnwUz-I2GI;There should be a budget x 2 catagory
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus MVP 2 years in a row let's go 💪🏽
4OnwUz-I2GI;give me 1 sir😃😻
4OnwUz-I2GI;spot on choices for sure.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I like s10😘
4OnwUz-I2GI;Well I think huawei has a better design in foldable phone dept mate X
4OnwUz-I2GI;My wife got the 3a for $300. At that price, it'd win. Whenever I see it and even use it a bit, I forget it isn't the flagship. It's damn good.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Waiting to hear Marques mention your phone is like😬😬😬😬 but oh well the family took a lot of awards SAMSUNG S10 PLUS GANG
4OnwUz-I2GI;A curious,  do you buy all of those phones or the company sponsors for advertising ??
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about redmi 8a with 5000mah battery, usb-c for just 100$?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have a question, i have galaxy s10 4 months now, and today i noticed that on the back side of the phone on every corner it had some tiny bubbles under the glass,   can someone tell me if has some similar experience and what should i do except replacing the glass. Thanks.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Everyone is talking about the phones in the comments and no one is talking about him wearing a t-shirt under a sports jacket.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm so impressed by you MKBHD for appreciating the work done to the OnePlus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Like literally all other award videos I saw
4OnwUz-I2GI;No one even talked about OnePlus
4OnwUz-I2GI;Love💖
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watched on my OP7 Pro. Proud af.
4OnwUz-I2GI;If you watched all or most of Marques’ phone reviews you predict all of the awards.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm just wondering why this is demonetized.
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD , cheers to another tech filled year! MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!😀
4OnwUz-I2GI;The best battery is ROG phone II
4OnwUz-I2GI;The best camera is 11 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;The best design is Fold
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sad Huawei noises
4OnwUz-I2GI;One Plus twice in a row?? Damn, they're putting out quality phones year after year. They deserve to get mainstream attention, especially after their great prices for these beasts.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Note 10 left the chat
4OnwUz-I2GI;Saying iPhone is the best attracts lots of haters
4OnwUz-I2GI;Your smartphone awards are better than any other award show, so the Award Show of the Year award goes to MKBHD. 🏆
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best midrange phone?? You have budget phone and best overall but no midrange.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Sup
4OnwUz-I2GI;I've said it before, why do you not review any sony xperia phones? I'm one of the few people that consistently buy them. The xperia 1 this year could have been a good contend or for best new form. A 21:9 aspect ratio screen. Better for scrolling web pages. Movies are filmed in 21:9.???????!!!!!??????!!!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Everyone in my school was making fun of my iPhone 5s and didn’t believe I had an s10
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching this on the OnePlus 7T McLaren and I'm loving every minute of it.
4OnwUz-I2GI;im confused why huawi p30pro didnt win the best camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where the hell is Huawei P30 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;who has a old cellphone outhere that didn't use? Can i ask for it?
4OnwUz-I2GI;No Sony Mobiles ??
4OnwUz-I2GI;It's gotten to the point that you can't pick out the smallest phone but rather replaces it with compact phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about durability
4OnwUz-I2GI;Redmi Note 8 pro for a real budget 250.00
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bruh I'm kinda pissed rn. See my sister and my brother always got expensive ass phones.and I always said I didn't want to spend any more than 500 on a phone. And in 2015 they got me the original lgstyle. It was decent. Took care of that phone for 5 years no scratches no cracks. And so my parent said if I let that phone last 3 years without any cracks they would get ke a nice phone. Then in 2020 they get me an a10e. Andi checked boost and this phone was on sale from 120 to 89
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have an Asus rog phone 2 and mine has been not a good phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Question of the day:
4OnwUz-I2GI;Never matter how many phones came to the market in every year. He will choose every year One plus series😁😂😜
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who still wants curved displays?? That's a terrible experience! Might Oneplus sponsored you greatly.
4OnwUz-I2GI;When it comes to gaming isn't Rog phone2 the best?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Cries in Samsung Galaxy S
4OnwUz-I2GI;Biggest improvement should have had s10 NGL at least as a runner up
4OnwUz-I2GI;Note 10 deserve Design Award. Galaxy Fold is more like a Conceptphone even its released.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I dont think you say asus this way he says asooooos
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who else feels poor..
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is the redmi note 7 the best budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;01:11 - Best Big Phone - ASUS ROG Phone 2
4OnwUz-I2GI;02:18 - Best Big Phone Runner up - Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
4OnwUz-I2GI;03:16 - Best Compact Smart Phone - Samsung Galaxy S10e
4OnwUz-I2GI;04:07 - Best Compact Smart Phone Runner up - iPhone 11 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Omgaaaaaa. Literally watching this because I have Pixel 4 buyers remorse big time.  Since I'm on Project Fi I'm considering downgrading to 3a to trade this crap in before it drops in price before it's too late. Dropping the wide-angle for a damn telephoto I've never used plus the crappy battery have had me feeling over it. Thanks for the help.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lol it's a book
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lolllllllllllllll
4OnwUz-I2GI;Motorola one hyper gang
4OnwUz-I2GI;I didn’t expect the ROG phone to be mentioned at all! Some surprises as always. Merry Christmas to y’all! 🎄
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who buys a phone to play games on it. 🤷🏻‍♀️ maybe a small kill time game like fruitpop but nothing major.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Any one mobile give me plz..
4OnwUz-I2GI;Are taken this real bro . They just phones .
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why is LG so underrated now? Its crazy. I went from the regular iphone x to the s9 and now to a V40, and it literally SLAPS every phone i've ever had. Those people that say lg is boring are the ones that are just hopping on the bandwagon of brand names tbh
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: ok best cheap phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Apple: 😳
4OnwUz-I2GI;The iPhone should have won
4OnwUz-I2GI;Dont you just want to pushe them all off with a singular hand movement right off the desk?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where are tecno phones🙄
4OnwUz-I2GI;Unaku enna pa..
4OnwUz-I2GI;who feels like we are at the Oscars
4OnwUz-I2GI;I use a S10e
4OnwUz-I2GI;Proud iPhone 11 owner here
4OnwUz-I2GI;Iphone had to get the battery award...
4OnwUz-I2GI;can i get a iphone 11
4OnwUz-I2GI;Man, Asus really hit it out of the park this year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;note 10 plus is number one
4OnwUz-I2GI;I got a LG G8X and I like it a lot! It looks nice and works well. I don't have the dual screen attachment yet, but it should be coming soon. I wish he mentioned it. It is a really good compromise for a folding phone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I like a phone that the Chinese government isn't listening to right out of the box
4OnwUz-I2GI;Nice.
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about “smartphone awards of this decade?”
4OnwUz-I2GI;holy CRAP you look fresh
4OnwUz-I2GI;I would’ve been surprised if the iPhone 11 pro didn’t win best camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;He likes the refresh rate thing so i bet he picked the 7pro. Just for that reason
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please I think Google Pixel 3a will be The best Design
4OnwUz-I2GI;You know its kinda serious video today, where marques comes out with a blazzer ....
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""If any of the companies want their trophies i will ship them over the holidays"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus Naruto running for the award
4OnwUz-I2GI;Confused between OnePlus 7T and Google Pixel 3a. Any suggestions? Both cost almost the same for me.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Mkbhd honorable mention best budget phone is oneplus 7t
4OnwUz-I2GI;Realme x2 pro be like who m i to you anyway, i have every thing of one plus 7t+ 64mp quad camera setup+ dual Dolby speaker+50 watt charger+head phone jack and 100$ cheaper still who m i to you any way
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oneplus 7t  the best
4OnwUz-I2GI;He really had to flex on us with those Chicago’s 16:03
4OnwUz-I2GI;For many reasons I am not agree with your choice of best phone of the year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;At least best on your own video it didn't receive any best awards in any part, then how it can be the best of the best?!
4OnwUz-I2GI;The Xperia 5 could of atleast got the runner up for best compact smartphone. But I guess no one cares about Sony anymore. 😒
4OnwUz-I2GI;If coronavirus becomes serious, which it most certainly is, and I survive this--I will look for android developers.
4OnwUz-I2GI;YES, best of 2019, OnePlus 7 Pro, love mine:)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Imagine watching this on a pixel4 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;The realme X2 Pro deserves a mention in this video💔
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Lmao making sure everyone sees him unbuttoning his jacket as he strolls on like ""oh hey, I didn't see you there 😏"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey, just wanted to know which phone you personally use.
4OnwUz-I2GI;would really like to see the full review of motorola one hyper !!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Note 10 Plus my daily driver, 11 Pro Max my vlogging phone & ROG my gaming phone. Hmmm. I got all the awards😊
4OnwUz-I2GI;Next time add The Most Favorite Phone, I'm really sure it will be iphone, cuz it's iphone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;17:37 that also goes for the samsung fold, whoever bought that 2000 bucks piece of garbage, should be punished
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""NEVER SETTLE"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Damn my phone MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;I still loving my note 10 plus
4OnwUz-I2GI;But you missed the best display award :(
4OnwUz-I2GI;oneplus 7 pro user❤️❤️❤️❤️
4OnwUz-I2GI;Phone of the year one plus 6
4OnwUz-I2GI;For me
4OnwUz-I2GI;Tried tested and true
4OnwUz-I2GI;Since I got OnePlus...never changed! They just deliver.quality.
4OnwUz-I2GI;This was my first Marcus video. I'm impressed with any one person with their own award show and over 3mil folks watched.  Takes networks decades and millions of dollars to build an award show with this viewership. Is he even 30?
4OnwUz-I2GI;What weather app is he using on 1:37 ? thanks ! :D
4OnwUz-I2GI;My phone vivo y53😔,please give me one 🙏
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching with OP7P
4OnwUz-I2GI;I never heard of many of these
4OnwUz-I2GI;Xperia 1?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Review the moto
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei Mate 30 pro the Best. Directamente de Moçambique Maputo
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wow very interesting award show
4OnwUz-I2GI;I am so poor I have never seen a iPhone 11 before
4OnwUz-I2GI;Could I have one of those phones I don't have one I'm interested in the phone please
4OnwUz-I2GI;I love my one plus 7 pro 5g
4OnwUz-I2GI;Everything on that table can buy me a car. And a good car too
4OnwUz-I2GI;his giving award to phones and the phone company's are am I joke to you?✊😂😂 phone company's are waiting their award plz give them ony by one ✊😂😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;One plus concept one
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is the best phone call experience award? XD
4OnwUz-I2GI;Send me one
4OnwUz-I2GI;I believe the P30 should have been given a chance for the best camera it's really good but it ain't my review
4OnwUz-I2GI;Interesting analysis. Most of this is relative, & quite a few notable phones not even mentioned.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm sad that the pixel 4 XL didn't win an award
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 4 is the biggest disappointment of 2019..
4OnwUz-I2GI;(P.s : I'm a  pixel 2 user )
4OnwUz-I2GI;budget phone its be Realme x2 pro and runner up its been k20 pro or also ASUS ROG II...disappointed be chosen pixel 3a its big blooper by google...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Samsung
4OnwUz-I2GI;A50 - $255
4OnwUz-I2GI;A70 - $323
4OnwUz-I2GI;X2 pro hands down the best budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Mi9t pro got an award !! 🤩. Literally bought it since it arrived and sold my SGS10. This device for $299 it's just a steal! Props to Marques for getting this Xiaomi in here. He didn't dig deep into in the review, but this MIUI11 has so many useful things instead of gimmicks. Like really, for privacy this is the best lol . Great video! Awards as expected. I thought the MVP would be a tie between the 7tPro and Galaxy S10 Pro, considering the discounts that have brought the S10+ to under $700 ..but nice picks overall
4OnwUz-I2GI;08:47:00 PM
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think realme x2pro should be the best budget phone of the year....
4OnwUz-I2GI;give me one Huawei mate 30 pro please
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oh and the A70 beats the Oneplus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;i have A50
4OnwUz-I2GI;I need that table full of mobiles u take care of awards 😒
4OnwUz-I2GI;Which is the best budget laptop for engineer ,beginner ,learner!?
4OnwUz-I2GI;dude what about Huawei mate x ???
4OnwUz-I2GI;What happen to Asus Zenfone 6...?!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei p30 pro???
4OnwUz-I2GI;These awards are way more fun to watch than regular awards
4OnwUz-I2GI;You should have tried the realme phone's 5000 mah battery
4OnwUz-I2GI;Is this the first actual tech award show? YOUTUBE!! What are you doing!!?? This is should be live!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;so one plus the winner even it not win for any category 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;not win for Battery or Design or Anything, but hey , he is Best phone on 2019 😂😂🖕
4OnwUz-I2GI;The end of the Nokia Era
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus rog 2, oneplus pro, iPhone 11 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD smartphone award is on par as Ballon Dor for football
4OnwUz-I2GI;markass brownies
4OnwUz-I2GI;i think american restrictions also apply on your video
4OnwUz-I2GI;that,s why you ignore huawei mate 30 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;best budget phone is the realme x2 pro and that's not even debatable
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hi buddy, wish to ask for one.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why mi is not coming with a stylus (s pen) as Samsung do?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Is there any possibility in the near future??
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm surprised P30 Pro didn't get into camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google’s 4 is looking like the iPhone 11
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""This is my show and I get to be a little biased"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;Chooses OnePlus 7 Pro as the MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;                           -MKBHD 2020
4OnwUz-I2GI;Every time he said big phone my brain autocompleted to “big phone energy”
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oneplus at it again 2 years in a row
4OnwUz-I2GI;Down a glass of water every time he says “in 2019”
4OnwUz-I2GI;How in the hell did the fold win best design. It's over priced, a POS, and uglier than other folding phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus take it again like last year
4OnwUz-I2GI;2018 OnePlus 6t
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019 OnePlus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;2020 OnePlus 8pro ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog phone 2 forever.....or until a Rog Phone 3 comes out...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Im gonna subscribe just because u got the Tesla app.
4OnwUz-I2GI;i-have-none-of-those-phones gang where you at?
4OnwUz-I2GI;i feel like the best camera was the one us 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;One plus is making tiny tweaks towards excellence if they improve camera and design it will be probably the best phone in world.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Let's be honest: we saw that mvp coming from a mile off
4OnwUz-I2GI;marq talks about bust of the year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 4 : my time has come.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on OnePlus 7 pro ♥️
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques keeping it real with the facts! Keeping up the good work! 🔥
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best Smartphone of the year
4OnwUz-I2GI;2018- OnePlus 6t
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019- OnePlus 7 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Great going OnePlus!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;How come you didn't put any realme phone in budget category.
4OnwUz-I2GI;That moment you cheered in you heart when he announced OnePlus 7 pro as a smartphone of the year.. Was so proud.
4OnwUz-I2GI;PS : I'm a S10 user.
4OnwUz-I2GI;S10e has all the good and almost none of the bad. High-end specs, good lenses, incredible display and the headphone jack! Been using it for 5 months as my daily driver now and couldn't be happier.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Samsung galaxy s10 plus
4OnwUz-I2GI;I shan’t a iPhone 11 Pro Max rose gold
4OnwUz-I2GI;giving a thumbs up cause you wore a jacket 🧥
4OnwUz-I2GI;"He's such a smart man;he didn't get a galaxy S6. It's actually the true P.O.S. I used to be the sucker that owned one."
4OnwUz-I2GI;2018: OnePlus 6T
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019: OnePlus 7 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus making really great phones damn
4OnwUz-I2GI;IMO the best overall phone goes easily to Huawei P30 Pro, why ? It has 1 of the best cameras as mentioned also in the video, very good battery life with 4200 mAh, pretty good speed and screen resolution as well and the price is also right now around 500 $ so my overall award would go to Huawei P30 Pro and am saying this as a huge Samsung fan.
4OnwUz-I2GI;HIM: the iphone has such a great battery
4OnwUz-I2GI;IPHONE 11: 3300mAh
4OnwUz-I2GI;400$ for a phone should not be called a budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;You have the money get a nice suit
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Did you skip ""the best gaming phone award"" just so that Asus dosent get another one?"
4OnwUz-I2GI;lol if you click the time stamp for budget phone, the first words he says are samsung galaxy fold, funnily enough the most expensive phone. (I know the time stamp is for after...)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why isn't the s10 5g on this list
4OnwUz-I2GI;They are wasting the flexible phone screen. A small flexible phone is what my pants are praying for.
4OnwUz-I2GI;No best audio / dac award? I know audiophiles are a niche market 👋 but high res audio, the leaps in compact dac’s & the diminishing need for a dap these days, I would have thought we’d see a best audio award from a content creator.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I bet pixel 4 is getting the disappointment award.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Yup. 64 gb for 1000$ is bullsh*t.
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus always is a top choice. I am not surprised that it won Phone of The Year. With all of the features with a lower price point then its competitors, it definitely is unique.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 4 was the victim of its own hype, after posting on Twitter the leak, it garnered itself MKBHD'S Bust of the Year. 100% no surprise there.
4OnwUz-I2GI;im curious: what's the best TELEphone of the year? XD best speaker/mic combo
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""But hey it's my show, so I get to be biased"" hahaha love it!"
4OnwUz-I2GI;Every time there's a recording of Dark Sky take a shot.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Expecting s10+ to win something but didn't at all, okay.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I am so glad my phone won the mvp
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey dude just wanted to say thanks for making vids that actually take up most of the screen on my pro Max!
4OnwUz-I2GI;So often I don’t feel the benefits as a lot of stuff is restricted to be smaller
4OnwUz-I2GI;P30 pro owners be like 😭😭😭
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Nice power play there.. ""If the company wants my award just ask... I am above you and are lucky to have me talking about your greedy asses.""  Love it.."
4OnwUz-I2GI;I've been using the Exynos version of Galaxy Note 10+, and it's been great. Wouldn't change it for anything else. Samsung's UI has really gotten better over the years, it's amazing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;hahahahah omg noob.... huawei the best... <3
4OnwUz-I2GI;Nice award ceremony, Marques.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I thought i would see the XIAOMI NOTE 10 in the best battery honourable mentions
4OnwUz-I2GI;Funny how every smartphone presented here will do the job for most users and still we try to find differences between them and argue on which one is the best..
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me watching the video and having a OnePlus 7T and thinking 😎
4OnwUz-I2GI;the most valuable table on earth
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best battery phone -
4OnwUz-I2GI;M30s crying in corner 🤣
4OnwUz-I2GI;Fastest charging -
4OnwUz-I2GI;X2 pro 😆 also crying in corner
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus, 2 years in a row!!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;No xiaomi mi mix 3, PENSIVE , Guess I'll have to throw mine out and get a iPhone 11 then.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where were all the A-lists celeb audience for these awards?! And wasn't Ellen available to host? 🤣
4OnwUz-I2GI;bye bye 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;"""ASOOS"""
4OnwUz-I2GI;I calculated the price of every phone, and apparently it’s worth more than a 2020 bmw x7. And the bmw is 101k
4OnwUz-I2GI;Realme x2 pro ain't  the best budget phone!?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on my k20 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;At the OnePlus keynote they sayd that 7 Pro is the best you can get this year and It was true :D
4OnwUz-I2GI;That intro
4OnwUz-I2GI;if you could give the XIAOMI MI MIX 2s a award, what award would i be?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Make it little shorter ♥️
4OnwUz-I2GI;Android authority gotta be kidding right ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Good job mkbhd 👍
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hell yeah I got the 7t pro you made me celebrate
4OnwUz-I2GI;realme x2 pro should be at least honorable mention for budget duuude!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;can i have one of the phones cause my phone is junk pls lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;Tbh in my opinion i feel like the 7 pro and the realme x2 pro are even
4OnwUz-I2GI;Motorllola one hyper review please
4OnwUz-I2GI;I really fluctuate between rog 2 and one plus 7 pro .. ???
4OnwUz-I2GI;one plus winning consecutive mvp awards
4OnwUz-I2GI;As far as the whole package - Note 10+ wins by a landslide. Pricing is debatable.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I dressed up for this award show 👨‍💼🍾
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just needed some background music..
4OnwUz-I2GI;Review the lenovo z6 pro plz
4OnwUz-I2GI;Realme x2pro best flagship phone in 2019 low budget price phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Motorola One Hyper review.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please....
4OnwUz-I2GI;One plus takes the cake again wow
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wait,isnt xiaomi redmi note 10 pro the best camera?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Give away plese 😁
4OnwUz-I2GI;phone collection
4OnwUz-I2GI;Realme x2 pro should have been the runner up for the best budget phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;The one plus 7t was 599
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bro I want google pixel 4 xl send me
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have to mention one thing. Giving 3rd party high quality headphones REALLY softens the blow of losing a headphone jack. Before this generation note lost the 3.5mm jack, they gave out akg buds for years. This time in the box I got a pair of those same akg buds, maybe slightly improved but with a usb C connector.
4OnwUz-I2GI;SONY XPERIA 1 ?!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Does he get PR for phones??? 🤔
4OnwUz-I2GI;I use oneplus 7 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;MVP ROG 2
4OnwUz-I2GI;Soo seems like Marques will just about to take all the awards home anyways.
4OnwUz-I2GI;IPhone 11:Best camera of the year
4OnwUz-I2GI;Mi note 10:Am I a joke to you
4OnwUz-I2GI;What do you think,  about $40,000 in phones on that table?
4OnwUz-I2GI;My eyes comitted suicide when he switched from dark to light mode on the Rog Phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I almost went from my s10 plus to the iphone 11 pro the other day, until i reminded myself everything i would loose, like the headphone jack, big notch in the middle of the screen, so less real estate, no fingerprint scanner... and as far as the cameras, i did a shootout test with a friend that had the iphone 11 pro max and i could not see much differences in picture quality! So... not sure how iphone would even be able to win phone of the year! But, heyy that's my opinion i guess! Cheers
4OnwUz-I2GI;redmi k20 pro is so good
4OnwUz-I2GI;My MVP would probably be the galaxy note 10 plus
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is the new motorola razr?
4OnwUz-I2GI;pixel 4 : we have radar
4OnwUz-I2GI;1+ 7t : bhah blah blah..............
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was so close to getting the Asus ROG phone but ended up getting the Galaxy s10 I kinda regret it now, that phone looks snazy.
4OnwUz-I2GI;If you are looking for midrange to premium category phone then go for Xiaomi Redmi note 8 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;And for some reason I just can't live without a pixel. I have tried other phones (one plus, lg, apple, samsung) but nothing feels like the pixel. (owning pixel 3)
4OnwUz-I2GI;you are the best youtube bro because u said that the one plus 7 pro is the best cuz i have one two
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just want that iphone pro gold
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can I have the cheapest phone in your table?
4OnwUz-I2GI;- “how many trophies should we give to Asus?”
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: “yes”
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about x2pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;how many of you paused the video just to count the number of smartphone he has on his table!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!👍
4OnwUz-I2GI;compact phones could still improve and look better
4OnwUz-I2GI;Who will claim the phone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is realme phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;Best SmartPhone In 2019
4OnwUz-I2GI;2018: OnePlus 6T
4OnwUz-I2GI;2019: OnePlus 7 Pro 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;Well Pixel 4 won something
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where are those phones goes?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Let's gooo 1+ wins it
4OnwUz-I2GI;Apple is the Best!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bro..All phones are yours??Please  give me just one lowest price phone,,,then I will be very happy.
4OnwUz-I2GI;The improvements for iphones are great only when it is compared with iphones. You have been mentioning iphone's battery improvement. But only when compared to it's previous models. There are also many greatly improved phones on your table.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Also I agree with the award given for pixel. I also expected a lot from it.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Guess the razor 2.0 came too late
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus Zenfone 6 should've won most improved no cap
4OnwUz-I2GI;Shame on the people who disliked this video!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Smartphone Awards 2020: Most Cameras award
4OnwUz-I2GI;The S10s solution to the notch puzzle was underappreciated tbh
4OnwUz-I2GI;Markques brownlee best camera in a phone: iphone 11 pro max. : Xoiami redimi mi note 10
4OnwUz-I2GI;This is a joke
4OnwUz-I2GI;The Pixel 4 is like the new Star Wars trilogy. People expected greatness but were quickly let down.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lol made trophies for phones for himself?
4OnwUz-I2GI;I want to know who called for their trophy, and who didn't :D
4OnwUz-I2GI;LG left the chat!
4OnwUz-I2GI;lmao iphone 11 uses 720p screen
4OnwUz-I2GI;Largest Hands of the Decade : Marques
4OnwUz-I2GI;Make a video of Motorola
4OnwUz-I2GI;I have the OnePlus 7 Pro in my pocket and I gotta say I'm hype to own this thing! I thought it was going to that Asus ROG considering it's streak but OnePlus did it again for the second year in a row. Good job OnePlus. Good job.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus 6Z is another phone needs mention for best all-rounder phone of the year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD be like ASUS ROG and IPHONE 11 PRO  are the winners in many categories but ultimately

4OnwUz-I2GI;Bruh.... Austin Evans did a blind test for the best camera between the OnePlus 7T and the iPhone 11 Pro Max and,the OnePlus clearly had better specs
4OnwUz-I2GI;if asus improves the camera next year, its going to grabbing all the awards lool

4OnwUz-I2GI;Really!! I am watching this video on my OnePlus 7pro 😍😍😍
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hi Marques

4OnwUz-I2GI;Already guessed most of the awards 🙋
4OnwUz-I2GI;"It sucks that the best ""compact"" phone is still huge"
4OnwUz-I2GI;lg not getting mentioned at all
4OnwUz-I2GI;P30 has 2 day battery life so your wrong
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: So up next is the Best Budget Smartphone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Apple and Samsung: Left the table.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Bust of the year : pixel 4
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: I'll still use it as my personal phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;I just bought OnePlus 7TPro McLaren Edition 3 days ago, I felt great, especially after watching this video.
4OnwUz-I2GI;How did p30 not win best design
4OnwUz-I2GI;And how did the p30 lite not win best budgeted... 1 plus 74 is the mvp 🙄🙄🙄 These awards are like the Grammy of phone awards as in they don't give phones that deserve awards awards.
4OnwUz-I2GI;You can't tell iPhone pays him lol

4OnwUz-I2GI;The OnePlus 7 Pro is my favorite phone to date! I seriously LOVE OnePlus!!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;The quality was so good, I got the winner spoilt, looking at the reading on the big trophy
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just imagine an honorable mention to the NOKIA 3310 For the
4OnwUz-I2GI; 'Legendary Phone of the Decade'
4OnwUz-I2GI;Tech Reviewers be like: 3000mAh give you one day sometimes less. 4000mAh give you more than a day, sometimes one and a half. 6000mAh give you 2 days all the time
4OnwUz-I2GI;Seems kind of counterintuitive to me
4OnwUz-I2GI;Smartphone Awards 2019: Asus ROG phone 2 edition
4OnwUz-I2GI;they nailed it though
4OnwUz-I2GI;Damn RIP pixel 4 ⚰
4OnwUz-I2GI;So proud to be a OnePlus user. The 7 Pro really is amazing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Talks about the pixel 4 camera all year and then give the award to iphone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Should have added a worst value category imo
4OnwUz-I2GI;The OnePlus 7 Pro is closer to being fantastic than not and best of all it's $499 right now.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why The Trophy is A toilet lol
4OnwUz-I2GI;mkbhd had to ship bust of the year award directly to Google Head Quarters , will GOOGLE accept it hahhaa
4OnwUz-I2GI;Don't forget Motorola
4OnwUz-I2GI;S10e FTW! (coule be the last samsung flaghsip that brings flat screen)
4OnwUz-I2GI;S10e gang
4OnwUz-I2GI;Never settle..
4OnwUz-I2GI;Such well made video
4OnwUz-I2GI;1:22 Check out the nod to Pewds with the razors
4OnwUz-I2GI;Can believe people still use headphone jack
4OnwUz-I2GI;Let me guess... all Notes and folds
4OnwUz-I2GI;Also, the Pixel 4's terrible design and build quality.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I would really love to hear your thoughts on the Huawei Mate 30 Pro. I love the design and I would love to know what you think. Definitely rooting for a review of that phone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;YAYYYY FOR HEADPHONE JACKS!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog 2 : got alot of awards and also have one of the best specs in the whole video
4OnwUz-I2GI;also Rog 2 : not a runner up in the best phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Subbed to you! 🔥 Great videos, love them!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching from a brand new iPhone 8 I just bought today 🤣
4OnwUz-I2GI;Oh Mr Brownlee I love the professionalism... smooth Jacket 🤣
4OnwUz-I2GI;Totally agree with you! Appreciated your work!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Redmi Note 8 pro is The Best Budget Phone :v

4OnwUz-I2GI;As i follow and watching your videos since 2018.
4OnwUz-I2GI;An award in which i put my sims in
4OnwUz-I2GI;The S10e would make a great MP3 smartphone.
4OnwUz-I2GI;18:23 opens google assistant on your phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Ugh...Just to be CLEAR
4OnwUz-I2GI;The OPPO RENO ACE IS NOT the FASTEST CHARGING PHONE this takes 30 minutes?!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please do a review of the One Hyper and the Mate 30 Pro. Happy New Year Marques and lots of joy for you😘🌞🍀
4OnwUz-I2GI;Asus taking all of the awards!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Plz review new moto phone :>
4OnwUz-I2GI;wooot! watching on my 7 Pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Overkill on the runner-up's, cool presentation overall.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching this on my  7 pro... Picked it up on Friday weekend for $550...Can't bet this . It's so smooth.. and fast.great battery life. Decent Camera...But not the best
4OnwUz-I2GI;You need to know the realme x2 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;You haven't review Realme yet?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Homie this video terrifies me every year because when I see it I feel like the last year happened over the past 12 seconds. Oh God what is happening to me. Is this growing up and ageing. Shit.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Hey!!! ✔️Why none of the reviewers mentioned about bloatware app of OnePlus named ""OnePlus Zenmode"", which can't be uninstalled or disabled, which consumes battery and data in background... Is it spyware or bloatware? OnePlus already had issues with data collection and data leaks several years ago."
4OnwUz-I2GI;What about the RealMe 2x Pro for best budget phone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on iPhone 11
4OnwUz-I2GI;And you don't know about Realme X2 pro?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Lmao... You really have the runner up award for most improved to the iPhone 11 pro, how sway?  If it was such an improvement I would have purchased it.  It's a pro model.  It can't be most improved for its first year.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Yeah that's my baby!!!!!MVP MVP MVP
4OnwUz-I2GI;HUAWEI - MKBHD = :(
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rip Huawei Mate 30 Pro :(
4OnwUz-I2GI;Fastest smartphone?
4OnwUz-I2GI;Mate 30 Pro review
4OnwUz-I2GI;paid revew by one plus...
4OnwUz-I2GI;Motorola slowly crawling back to the top it seems, so please show us the new RAZR when it launches and now the one hyper
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was hoping that Realme X2 Pro would have been in there.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Happy OnePlus 7 Pro user here
4OnwUz-I2GI;When he said the bust of the year was the pixel 4👌👌👌
4OnwUz-I2GI;Just got my new OnePlus 7 Pro, then watched this video.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Right in the feels <3
4OnwUz-I2GI;No Mention for s10 plus?
4OnwUz-I2GI;i can't believe iPhone 11 pro/max win the camera's category ?
4OnwUz-I2GI;it must Huawei Mate 30 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;one min silent for google fans 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;I like how the iPhone 11 Pro looks like an iPhone SE in his hands
4OnwUz-I2GI;Wait, the bust of the year is not the Samsung fold?
4OnwUz-I2GI;MKBHD: 2019 SMARPHONE AWARDS
4OnwUz-I2GI;ME: it’s 2020
4OnwUz-I2GI;OnePlus should make trade in program like apple.
4OnwUz-I2GI;My boy Asus Zenfone 6 got no love:/
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei - Hold my ban
4OnwUz-I2GI;He forgot the Motorola Razr
4OnwUz-I2GI;Picked up a Oneplus7 pro on black Friday for £600!!!! Absolutely blown away by it, couldn't be happier.
4OnwUz-I2GI;All high end phones
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think the most improved award should go to galaxy S10+ because it improved literally everything a smartphone has over S9+.🤔
4OnwUz-I2GI;He forgot the Realme X2 Pro. Its definately better than Redmi k20 pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Please review the Huawei Mate 30 Pro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Where is realme x2pro
4OnwUz-I2GI;Moto Moto...
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was getting sad because you didn't mention the 7 pro ,I'm glad I see the entire video :') because I bought that phone because of this channel
4OnwUz-I2GI;These awards are for phone companies to use them in their ads
4OnwUz-I2GI;Nokia 9 PureView
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google: Lets see how is he gonna be able to use his primary phone from now on???😎😎👿😈
4OnwUz-I2GI;As I'm watching on my OnePlus 7 pro. 😎
4OnwUz-I2GI;Realme x2 pro budget phone I think is better....90hz display and vooc charge , top chipset,  64meg pixels main camera ,amoled metal , rain proof etc ......
4OnwUz-I2GI;Dude, where's Realme X2 pro? It's way better than k20 pro.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Hey can I have that note 10 because I know you is not using it 😂😂😂 pleaseeeee
4OnwUz-I2GI;Woah! That shot at 5:26. Can't believe this is YouTube!!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Watching on OnePlus 7 Pro, I feel like I made the right purchase decision this year 😂
4OnwUz-I2GI;I so wanted Zenfone 6 to be the most improved phone winner.
4OnwUz-I2GI;That was satisfying to watch.
4OnwUz-I2GI;"Google pixel 4 ad: ""I'm finally catching Marques Brownlee tonight!""😂"
4OnwUz-I2GI;Huawei needs more love smh, damn propaganda got yall muricans confused.
4OnwUz-I2GI;If it wasn't for the US ban, Huawei mate 30 Pro would have been the best camera phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;So we now have:
4OnwUz-I2GI;One Plus (MVP winner) vs ROG Phone 2 (3 trophies winner)
4OnwUz-I2GI;Rog 2 out here slaying
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was disappointed bcoz i thought OnePlus 7 pro is not in the list .... But boom.... MVP is OnePlus 7 pro.... ☺️
4OnwUz-I2GI;It should’ve been smartphone awards of the decade in my humble opinion
4OnwUz-I2GI;When you put the fold face down, my bank account screamed at me
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google you should be ashamed of yourselves . Pixel 4 was such a let down, that's coming from a Pixel fan.😔 Looking forward to getting rid of my 2XL in 2020 with something amazing.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I was all set to buy the Pixel 4 XL. But then they launched it, and it was just as disappointing as expected. Ah such a pity!
4OnwUz-I2GI;Pixel 4 doesn't even deserve to be in the thumbnail
4OnwUz-I2GI;Could anyone else see the awards and winners on the table??
4OnwUz-I2GI;Last year's winner was also OnePlus
4OnwUz-I2GI;Feel proud when you watching this in one plus phone. Rocking 6T from last year but still one of the best phone out there! 👍
4OnwUz-I2GI;“If you turn it down to 90hz...”
4OnwUz-I2GI;don't forget to mention that pixel 4 didn't survive jerryrigseverything's durability test.
4OnwUz-I2GI;its an ASUS show
4OnwUz-I2GI;I wonder if google will accept their award for bust of the year and incentivize making a banger next year
4OnwUz-I2GI;Merry new year and a happy Christmas
4OnwUz-I2GI;I'm not sad cus the SGN 10+ won the blind test
4OnwUz-I2GI;dxo mark rated huawei p30 pro as the best smartphone camera
4OnwUz-I2GI;Me at 12 AM: K time to sleep
4OnwUz-I2GI;Marques: Not so fast
4OnwUz-I2GI;Google Pixel 4 is the Anthony bennett of smartphones
4OnwUz-I2GI;Why do you this award thingy if youre gonna compelety ignore public data?
4OnwUz-I2GI;You're washed up
4OnwUz-I2GI;Now if only one+ could figure out how to put an sdcard reader on this thing...
4OnwUz-I2GI;For the first 20 minutes I was worried that the OnePlus phones wouldn't win anything
4OnwUz-I2GI;Never had a pixel never thought highly of them, with the 4 I feel like it was such an upgrade from my Samsung 7 with its 90 Hz and camera but why it did it be a bust because people thought highly of it, honestly I understand, but the flex pi didn't get it? Like it broke it just done didn't work. At least the pixel works with 90 hz for a long time and with a killer camera.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I am proud to be user of oneplus 7t........
4OnwUz-I2GI;😎😎😎
4OnwUz-I2GI;He
4OnwUz-I2GI;WoW .... with 38 smartphones on that table is easily over $30,000 in phones. I'm surprised the Note 10 Plus did win more awards, but great video. I would love to feel in the hand just how good the ROG phone is with it's higher refresh rate. I may go to the T-Mobile store to test it out.
4OnwUz-I2GI;Motorazr 2019 should be on one of the best design phone
4OnwUz-I2GI;Didn't even feel its 25minutes long.
4OnwUz-I2GI;I think that realme X2 pro is the better budget phone than Redmi.
qHOlHLCRpak;People need to learn what love really is. The world got most of y'all so messed up that you think you can cheat throughout your whole relationship and still claim you love the person you cheating on. Let me put it this way,  if you do love the person,  love is way at the bottom of your list of priorities in your relationship.  This video gives an example of someone who has lust as their number one priority then felt guilty about hurting someone he cared about. Not loved. When you love someone,  you don't willfully put yourself in positions to cheat on them with multiple partners. Love is sacrifice,  commitment, and selfless.  Learn what love is and where to prioritize it in your relationship then maybe y'all can start making music that promotes love. Lying and cheating don't mix with love.
qHOlHLCRpak;I remember making the biggest mistake of my last relationship. My ex girlfriend caught me talking another girl when we were trying to work things out. It was such a shame I had to lie to be with her, but we both knew we weren't gonna work out.. And when the night came to let go, I played this song on repeat and we both just sat in the car and cried.. I regret all the shit I've done to her, she didn't deserve so much pain from me or anyone. You were such an angel, I love and miss you. I hope you're out there happy somewhere. You run my mind..
qHOlHLCRpak;Smartphones aint cheap
qHOlHLCRpak;I don't think he is trying to promote cheating or lying I think he's just being real 9 times out if 10 when people cheat they do lie .. This is what makes this song so amazing it real and that high note is icing on the cake 👌
qHOlHLCRpak;my babymama broke my phone bcuz of this song 😂😂😂
qHOlHLCRpak;Man this hit home for cheaters man this a classic 😂😂🤦‍♂️
qHOlHLCRpak;All 2019 running to him lying right to his face😂🏃💃
qHOlHLCRpak;shouldn't it be Smartphones don't cheat? lol
qHOlHLCRpak;"This song brings attention to what goes on in a lot of relationships/marriages. In reality men And women cheat but there IS a double standard that we can not escape. There is a very high percentage of women that will take back their man/husband for infidelities. However, there is a very low percentage of men that will take back their woman/wife. I believe that it is because of a woman's nature - to nurture and support. Due to these wonderful qualities that women have in their DNA, they believe they can change their man for the better. Sadly, men on a large scale don't share the same qualities - ego plays a big role in that. When he says, "" I'mma run to her and lie right to her face..."", it's not that it's romantic as Judith Ansley says but it's the TRUTH. A man's love is strong so he will do anything to keep what he loves. Even if he cheats for the rest of the relationship, that does not mean his love for his woman should be questioned - it's sad but true. It's strange also that a lot of woman respect the fact that a man would lie to them rather than tell them the hurtful truth - like in 'Baby Boy' - "" ...I only lie to you because I care about your feelings..."" I just wish more woman would realize the power that they have and teach us men how to treat them - meaning don't take any BS from any man - Paula Patton style ^_^"
qHOlHLCRpak;This is my song .. I swear I love this song.. 👌💯🙌
qHOlHLCRpak;if u cheat on a person u not really n love wit dem its jus lust, infaction, r security if u really n love wit 1 u blond to every otha person
qHOlHLCRpak;Who here 2018❤️❤️?
qHOlHLCRpak;The music video is amazing. The ending part of when she was trying to kill herself made me cry..😔
qHOlHLCRpak;If you constantly find your man jamming to any of the songs on this album, then that aint your man, he for everybody!
qHOlHLCRpak;"if my boyfriend did this to me I would've went to his house and shoved the phone down his thoak and walked off saying ""whatever it takes, to kill you."""
qHOlHLCRpak;I love this song. He's not saying hey cheating is good. He's trying to make a point most people eff without thinking and cheat on their love ones without thinking thoroughly about consequences. When they face it they realize where they stand and he do anything to keep their love one. He's making everyone realize about cheating.
qHOlHLCRpak;2019?? Im heree
qHOlHLCRpak;“I’m young, so why would I focus on one girl when there are so many.” “It’s okay when I do it because ima boy so that would make me a player but if you do it it’s bad because that makes you a h*e” <— I put up with this kid for six months, HALF A YEAR, that I will never get back. If they playin games and they ain’t actually down leave them the first chance you get. You deserve better.
qHOlHLCRpak;currently in a happy relationship, this song just makes me reflect lol but 2019 anyone?

qHOlHLCRpak;"Who learned that he saying ""lie right to her face ""&want to blame it on tha smartphones"
qHOlHLCRpak;I love this song❤❤❤❤❤
qHOlHLCRpak;"I like this song. Like I've been playing this on repeat for the past two days. A lot of people have already posted and said that the message is terrible. Kinda like Kevin Gates song Pose to be in love. Trey know cheating not right, EVERY man and women who's been in a relationship or wants to be in a relationship knows it's not right to act single when you ARE in a relationship with a person you're supposed to be happy and in love with. But this song is factual. Men, and women but trey is a heterosexual male singer, sometimes cheat on their significant other and when they get caught red handed, they lie through they teeth to try and salvage the relationship. Even if it's WRONG, they'll say they didn't fuck him/her, that the person they was cheating with is a psycho liar slash stalker slash thirst bucket, that the other person cane on to THEM, etc etc. That's how it is, sadly. People cheat then lie about it because they're selfish and emotionally unstable. Cheaters aren't rational, they think ""yeah I fucked up, but we LOVE each other, so forgive me, give me a second chance, I don't even wanna talk about it no more."" And you standing there thinking he lost his fucking mind. Lmfaoo but this song is GOOD, it speaks on a situation a lot people are in and trey sings so beautifully"
qHOlHLCRpak;Has been on repeat all day
qHOlHLCRpak;this is so true and it be jammin
qHOlHLCRpak;And i thought last chance had good bass but this song tops it  😍😍👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿🇯🇲🇯🇲
qHOlHLCRpak;Iv seriously listened to this song 20 x and still goin till I learn every lyric
qHOlHLCRpak;Anyone on 2019❤️
qHOlHLCRpak;I dont know what I'm going to say😔
qHOlHLCRpak; This describes like basically what I did and how I was thinking well minus the sex
qHOlHLCRpak;He’s basically explaining what it’s like from a mans perspective after they get caught cheating
qHOlHLCRpak;DAMN!!!!!! LOVE THIS JAM!!!! TREY BABY BEST BY FAR!
qHOlHLCRpak;2018 and I'm still messed up about this song 💔✨

nEzgkRqkHFg;I've been using my Oppo F5 Youth phone for almost 2 years and suddenly nagkaLCD so I'm looking for a replacement. I'm not ready to change my phone yet kasi may sentimental value saken, which is I bought it using my earnings from my first job but I need to since phones are considered as a necessity nowadays. That's how I stumble upon your YT Channel and napakalaking help kasi ilang araw ko din pinag-iisipan kung anong phone ang dapat para saken. Thank your for the wonderful reviews.

Is the time to choose phones dahil 5 of the biggest smartphone companies ay mg lalabas ng napaka murang mga sulit phones 2nd week of Feb- 3rd week of march.. Kayo kung ako sa inyo mga ka tech mg ipon ipon na, by the way super amoled na ang k30 Pro at 120 refresh base on my cousin who works at xiaomi. At the amount of 19,990, sad to say the mi 10 is just 90 but will use the 108 premium with snap 865 just imagine guys.. But that one will be at 29,990

nEzgkRqkHFg;Simula nang mapadpad ako sa channel na toh. Dito na ako nagbabase ng bibilin kong phone. Before year-end balak ko sana bumili ng phone and based sa mga previous videos niyo napabalak akong bumili ng xiaomi redmi note 7 even though d siya ung pinakamagandang phone as of this moment pero dahil well-explained sa videos niyo ung unit na un at na meet ng unit na un ung gusto ko sa isang phone (un lang din kc kaya ng budget XD) kaya nagkaroon ako ng final decision na un na lang bilin. Actually it is my friends recommendation na icheck sa channel na toh para malaman ko ang pinakasulit na phone na on the budget lang kung baga mura pero andun na ang lahat ng kailangan mo at d ako nagsisisi na napadaan ako dito dahil madami akong nalaman na d ko alam dati. No wonder na irerecommend ko din ito sa iba ko pang mga kaibigan para mainformed din sila, like me, knowing na we are not that techy or not well-informed to this kind of things. Yun lang po hehe Maraming Salamat po. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

LCGnT3iQdMQ;Video pic kis phone ki lgayi hai ye to batao
LCGnT3iQdMQ;S8 is actually $963. (More than RS10,0.00
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Samsung is shit😤😤.. Always one or the other problems.. Yesterday i bought Samsung A Tab version 7.0 of course it's a new tab.. After one week usage.. Problems started to arrive.. Heating of backcase and high consumption of battery.. Even though it has 4000mah and low screen brightness..
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Mate 10is not that beautiful..
LCGnT3iQdMQ;No wonder why Huawei is the first. It outshines all. The launch of its mid-end nova 3i sees queue as well
LCGnT3iQdMQ;The music doesn't fit on the video a calmer music would have been better in the pixle 2xl
LCGnT3iQdMQ;nice joke

LCGnT3iQdMQ;It's a clickbait, do not come here
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Sorry but the XA1 from Sony is the most timeless design phone ever made. Yes I know it's a mid range old phone.
LCGnT3iQdMQ;https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07YDBV1QR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B07YDBV1QR&linkCode=as2&tag=123450a329-21&linkId=5a5389422988cfe6563f8acfa9633e62
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8 is beautiful than s8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Who else likes click bait
LCGnT3iQdMQ;आसीकपटैल
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I'm glad that you put the Huawei mate 10 and mate 10 pro at number one
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I really  disagree with the video because I think the line should be like this:
LCGnT3iQdMQ;1.Note 8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;2. Galaxy S8+
LCGnT3iQdMQ;3.OTHERS. ..
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I disagree
LCGnT3iQdMQ;It really good
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I m glad that i have s8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I have google pixel
LCGnT3iQdMQ;য়
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Wher is the samsung galaxy S10e S10 S10+
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Awesome video
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I have note 8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I have note 10 +
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8 best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Mujha bhi ek chahiaya all mobiles were too awesome
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Google pixel!!! Really!!! It's ugly
LCGnT3iQdMQ;oppo find x is the best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;samsung note 8/s8 and lg v30
LCGnT3iQdMQ;MI mix is so beautiful
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8 the killer
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Iphone 7 plus best phone or not
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Everyone here flooding about Note 8 and I'm just fascinated by Google Pixel 2... I love every bit of it
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Where is Nokia 8?
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Bad 4 eyes video
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Iphone x is the bestest
LCGnT3iQdMQ;You had been @Note 8... you lost me at iPhone X... Cause that iPhone X is fugly AF... But the rest are good except that LG phone...
LCGnT3iQdMQ;such a fake
LCGnT3iQdMQ;The iPhone x doesn't deserve a higher spot than the s8,  the s8's curved infinity display just looks brilliant,  while the notch on  the x has a reason for it,  it is ugly
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Wow show suit
LCGnT3iQdMQ;LG doesnt have originality on screen. Even iphone X. LG and iphone copied the infinity display of Galaxy S8. My goodness!
LCGnT3iQdMQ;absolutely Samsung note 8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;One plus 5t should also be their
LCGnT3iQdMQ;My choice is note 8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;note 8 best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Huawei mate 20 is best and better then note 8 and s8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;note8
LCGnT3iQdMQ;not 8 price plzz rply
LCGnT3iQdMQ;There are other phones more beautiful and good performance than those device.
LCGnT3iQdMQ;First phone.
LCGnT3iQdMQ;16 million colors?
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Do you know that the human eyes can only see 7 million?
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Where's the essential phone??????? It looks better than all of them.
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Kachra kar diya. Note 8 ko 5th position. Or huewai ko 1.
LCGnT3iQdMQ;This caption is not right for this video you r only show world most rated phones your comparison is not on its looks
LCGnT3iQdMQ;iPhone 10 is the best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Only NOTE 8 is A GUY ..all others GIRLS
LCGnT3iQdMQ;note 8 is d best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Google pixel is Extremely UGLY
LCGnT3iQdMQ;google pixel 2 it was ugly
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Nokia x Lunch to odisa
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Pixel 2 is not suitable for this list
LCGnT3iQdMQ;What about huawei p smart (2019) in blue
LCGnT3iQdMQ;You just got the most expensive phones in the market and put them in the video dont mention the adds and the unecessary long video
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8 should be on frist
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Awesome
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Ads are both
LCGnT3iQdMQ;iphone X is Perfect Because it's 25% Faster than the note 8..But the problem is it was defeated by Xiaomi just in 8%...but iPhone is the best for me...
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8th is the best one!
LCGnT3iQdMQ;My Nokia phone much better than this all phone
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Where is iphone..rabies
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Even s9+ is better than iphone xs max
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Nope, neither one of these phones would be in the top beautiful looking smart phones list esp not the Google pixel. Honestly the Nubia Z17 mini alone looks way better than all these smart phones combined.
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Only Samsung
LCGnT3iQdMQ;What is name of first opening music? Please tell anyone
LCGnT3iQdMQ;S8 best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;where is Vivo v7 plus? that is a good phone too
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Google pixel   looks ugly
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Samsung  is best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8 is best phone
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8 is the best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Ugh I can buy note 8 BUT ITS BIG
LCGnT3iQdMQ;only s8 is beast and best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Pixel is damn ugly........ya got bad taste.
LCGnT3iQdMQ;I have iphone 8 plus and samsung galaxy note 9
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Total rupees:-
LCGnT3iQdMQ;81,000 + 85,000 = 1,66,000
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Why do people insist on putting the stupidest, most irritating music on there videos. Narrative descriptions are much more useful to the viewers, don't ya think?
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Apple iphone x is no 1 for all rich people
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Note 8 is best
LCGnT3iQdMQ;ok
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Pixel is not beautiful
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Bakwas
LCGnT3iQdMQ;iPhone X is the best....I have one😎
LCGnT3iQdMQ;Samsung galaxy note 8 ad was long boring and annoying.
RBaua5o0PVw;So difficult to pick just 5! Which are your Top 5? (Remember, we can still be freinds 😜)
RBaua5o0PVw;1:note10+
RBaua5o0PVw;2:iphone 11pro max
RBaua5o0PVw;3:s10+
RBaua5o0PVw;4:oneplus 7t
RBaua5o0PVw;Supersaf : i had the s10+ in my pocket for a very long time
RBaua5o0PVw;Me &my s6 edge+ : hold my beer 😂
RBaua5o0PVw;Google legit messed up in 2019
RBaua5o0PVw;Title: TOP 5
RBaua5o0PVw;Phones on the table: are we a joke to you?
RBaua5o0PVw;"It makes me happy to see people saying ""I didn't have a chance to use every single type of phone that came out in 2019""😂😂"
RBaua5o0PVw;Top 5 smartphones of 2019:
RBaua5o0PVw;1-oneplus 7t pro
RBaua5o0PVw;2-galaxy note 10+
RBaua5o0PVw;3-galxy s10+
RBaua5o0PVw;1- S10+
RBaua5o0PVw;2- note 10+
RBaua5o0PVw;3- iphone 11 pro max
RBaua5o0PVw;4- OnePlus 7 pro
RBaua5o0PVw;I love how my S10 plus has a headphone jack and the expandable storage. It's been an all-around good phone.
RBaua5o0PVw;So technically you chose every flagship of 2019
RBaua5o0PVw;OnePlus 7T Pro for the amazing 90Hz edge to edge display, warp charge, Android 10 and for me the best phone of 2019 by a long way. Low price is also a bonus but either way still wouldn't swap it for any of the others.
RBaua5o0PVw;MY OPINION :--
RBaua5o0PVw;1.NOTE 10+
RBaua5o0PVw;2.11 PRO MAX
RBaua5o0PVw;3.P30 PRO
RBaua5o0PVw;My favourite phones this year:
RBaua5o0PVw;Samsung galaxy s10+
RBaua5o0PVw;iPhone 11 Pro Max
RBaua5o0PVw;OnePlus 7T Pro 5G Maclaren Edition
RBaua5o0PVw;I thought the bonus one would've either been the realme or oppo reno 🤔
RBaua5o0PVw;1:10 supersaf i had the device with me for a very very long time(probably arround 2-3months)

C1QC8NNODsw;2019
C1QC8NNODsw;Best smartphone: Asus Rog Phone 2, they nailed it with the 6000mAh
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones lost their purpose the moment they upped the price and started cutting features like the headphone jack and IR blaster.
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: I’m over smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;Also Austin: Hey guys this is Austin and here’s the new IPhone 11

C1QC8NNODsw;2019 Every tech youtubers: Holy s**t
C1QC8NNODsw;From the look of it I'm going to be sticking with my s10+ for a few years
C1QC8NNODsw;All I want is a phone that can play Triple A video games at 4k 60 fps with foldable 8 inch screen.
C1QC8NNODsw;did you say “go to the gym and watch netflix?”
C1QC8NNODsw;the gym is not for you
C1QC8NNODsw;JAMES CHARLES ASKED YOU TO MARRY
C1QC8NNODsw;LIKE TO AGREE
C1QC8NNODsw;I still think there’s a long way to go with phones, imagine an all screen phone (front back sides) no matter which way you pull it out of your pocket it’ll be rightside up, under display cameras (face id, main camera can be used for selfie camera) and all screen touch id!
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: is over smart phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Me who bought a flip phone at the thrift store: yeah nice
C1QC8NNODsw;He says he is over smartphones but as soon as the video ends he calls his dad on a smartphone and asks him if he could be on his next video.
C1QC8NNODsw;Still confused why we have to buy phone cases. Can't we just make a phone so strong that it won't crack everytime we drop it?

C1QC8NNODsw;Austin:Holographic phones are boring.
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin you're getting old
C1QC8NNODsw;The good ol days😑
C1QC8NNODsw;You know what's wow about smartphones in 2019?
C1QC8NNODsw;You can spend $200 and have an awesome phone. No need for this $1000 shoppaholic nonsense.
C1QC8NNODsw;So if you're over smartphones, will you go back to having a basic flip phone?
C1QC8NNODsw;Can't believe we will never see another smart phone video from you, since you are over smart phones 😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

C1QC8NNODsw;He doesn't guess the Redmi Note 7
C1QC8NNODsw;Me: get's mad
C1QC8NNODsw;Also me: feels happy
C1QC8NNODsw;Tbh I've heard this coversation over years countless times, I remeber a point in time in the galaxy s5 era where some tech youtuber said that you would be better off with an htc one or a galaxy s4 because smartphones weren't getting better and didn't offer much else. But in the recent years smartphones have gone through a constant evolution. Maybe you guys can't think of new stuff for smartphones but thats the point, the industry is encharged of making this changes and to make smartphones evolve in a way people don't expect.
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple: Releases iPhone
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: HEY GUYS THIS IS AUSTIN
C1QC8NNODsw;The biggest changes in the next few years for phones will be camera quality
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung launches note 10/10plus
C1QC8NNODsw;At the same time - Austin:I am over smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung left the chat
C1QC8NNODsw;Microsoft joined the chat
C1QC8NNODsw;People are gonna stop upgrading frequently. Than the real evil subscription models will be forced on consumers. Apple already has one but soon good devices would be subscription only.
C1QC8NNODsw;I remember those days when apple was like the 'epicenter' of revolutionary products. I think apple is letting us all down with their marketing and normal upgrades.
C1QC8NNODsw;"We Are entering age when ""new"" smartphones Are loosing features that ""old"" phones had"
C1QC8NNODsw;Should you use a phone in 2019?

C1QC8NNODsw;I'm still with my S7 Edge and it's already been 3 years. I'm about to keep it for another two years!
C1QC8NNODsw;"I love my flip phone ;). Makes and receives PHONE calls. Imagine that! I paid $9.99 for it at K Mart."
C1QC8NNODsw;The beginning of the video makes me realize how unappreciative we are. Would you rather have a phone like an iPhone 3g or iPhone xs max
C1QC8NNODsw;It's all the same now, hopefully the foldables bring that excitement back
C1QC8NNODsw;I used galaxy s2 for 5 years and then i switched to j7, still using it.

C1QC8NNODsw;I feel you .. they got boring & change things up for the sake of it
C1QC8NNODsw;4:08 that's a bad argument imo, i like it that I have different phone styles to choose from. Not everyone is rich like you and will just go with the best phone out there. Different choices for different people. Like if u agree.
C1QC8NNODsw;When he said we gone from this to this My internet crashed LOL
C1QC8NNODsw;The thumbnail had me like WHY?!

C1QC8NNODsw;The moral of the story, don't buy a phone every year, only reviewers do that.
C1QC8NNODsw;Got to learn one thing from this video.
C1QC8NNODsw;-BUY A FOLDING PHONE (when they become glitch free)
C1QC8NNODsw;5:17 both of them have their legs on their laps
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin:I'm done with smart phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Me: say sike right now
C1QC8NNODsw;I’ve been sitting with a 5 SE for two years
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin with his sneaker game right on with those NMDs
C1QC8NNODsw;His intro triggered my Google Assistant, thanks Austin 😉
C1QC8NNODsw;"Austin: ""We got a physical button there"""
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin again: That's the Note8
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 10 plus is still gonna be the best phone this year
C1QC8NNODsw;6:33 Austin said stan koya and bt21.
C1QC8NNODsw;This is because we've attained near perfection, and its just improving what already exsist
C1QC8NNODsw;iOS 13, on the other hand, is amazing!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;ME : SAVING MONEY TO BUY A BEAST PHONE
C1QC8NNODsw;AUSTIN : I'm OVER Smartphones...
C1QC8NNODsw;Ok but the thumbnail was a bit too over reactive lmao
C1QC8NNODsw;Still waiting for my PAIR PHONE
C1QC8NNODsw;6:27 Koyaa
C1QC8NNODsw;I know I am annoying but I can't help myself
C1QC8NNODsw;I have a cheap Xiaomi with Android one, it has a headphone Jack and dual SIM that is way more useful than any other gimmick crammed into this thousand dollar flagships!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Feels a home button
C1QC8NNODsw;Click it
C1QC8NNODsw;Coming into the video: What is this dumb title ?
C1QC8NNODsw;Leaving the video: Damn, he's right.
C1QC8NNODsw;3:19 no one ever said 6.7 inch the note 10+ is 6.8 inches anywhere u look😂
C1QC8NNODsw;reads title
C1QC8NNODsw;Me: So you moving back to the old phones? They ain't smartphones. They are just phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;LG G8 *ThinQ*: This one's chunkier... lol
C1QC8NNODsw;A really important take on something no one else is talking about, good choice involving Jon. Great work Austin senpai !
C1QC8NNODsw;0:18 And yet, that Nexus one is still my favorite smartphone. Physical keys, a navball, and an interface that, while not pretty nor amazing, wasn't designed as assbackwards  as they are going right now considering how early in development was.
C1QC8NNODsw;"10:23 ""go to the gym and your watching Netflix"" 😂😂😂 Now that's different!!"
C1QC8NNODsw;We haven’t had “Huge Leaps” since the iPhone 5 lol, ever since then it’s been small improvements.
C1QC8NNODsw;What a silly video. The advances have been amazing in just one year. You loco Austin.
C1QC8NNODsw;0:00 Lmao
C1QC8NNODsw;Still rocking my OnePlus 3T since the launch
C1QC8NNODsw;I still have my S8+ And feel no need to change.
C1QC8NNODsw;Just like what MKBHD said in Joe Rogan's podcast, the smart phone has reached its final form kind of
C1QC8NNODsw;The only thing I love from samsung software is the secure folder option for waifu and pop corn content.
C1QC8NNODsw;7:51 The best screen design nowadays compre to notch and punch hole.
C1QC8NNODsw;Thank you for making this video Austin. Same thought right here. Still on J3 Pro until D-Day come..
C1QC8NNODsw;Thumbnail: Austin throwing phone in bin.
C1QC8NNODsw;Me in first 5 seconds: Guys lets go dumpster diving in Austins office!
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: We got a physical button here! i wonder what phone this might be.
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: its a Note 8!
C1QC8NNODsw;I was talking about the this a week ago with a friend. I miss the variety of models, and can't think of anything else I need in a phone (Galaxy S9 plus user).
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm watching this on my Note8 and I'm still happy with it
C1QC8NNODsw;And this is exactly why I'm still using S7 egde for the last 3 and half years...
C1QC8NNODsw;Imagine a phone with just a display being run by a watch you are wearing .
C1QC8NNODsw;This should've been titled
C1QC8NNODsw;"""Why do smartphones exist in 2019?"""
C1QC8NNODsw;wow i remember when you did the pants bend on the iphone 6....... ....... ...... 🤣🤣🤣
C1QC8NNODsw;Seeing Jon makes me happy
C1QC8NNODsw;Thanks god, a tech-youtuber with brain! Since many years i am saying the industry has reached the peak. No need to buy a new phone every 2,3,4,5 years
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: All the phones are the same
C1QC8NNODsw;Me: Laughs in holographic phone
C1QC8NNODsw;04:14:00 AM
C1QC8NNODsw;Thats not the Note 10 Plus 5G
C1QC8NNODsw;2 more years for my s8plus, I think...
C1QC8NNODsw;No headphone jack is always a dumb move. It’s always good to have, without this the Note is not a Pro device (which it claims to be)
C1QC8NNODsw;I might be addicted to Austin’s voice
C1QC8NNODsw;I used to know about every new phone and every new feature along with every version and everything in between. Ever since maybe the S9, I've lost touch with it. You're right. It's boring now.
C1QC8NNODsw;I've honestly thought this since 2018
C1QC8NNODsw;before 2010 everything was more innovative, more special and interesting, after 2010 most things became generic and boring, not just phones but pretty much everything that exists!
C1QC8NNODsw;Amazon mystery tech or prank suggestion Amazon houses are a thing now tell Austin you bought one. 🤣
C1QC8NNODsw;I think iPhones are incredibly important but in terms of something amazing the iPad is doing great things
C1QC8NNODsw;Don’t forget that using the same phone for several years is much better for the environment than what phone companies want us to do.
C1QC8NNODsw;When he says to this, he shows the Pixel 3xl!!!! Really!!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones with both x86/64 & ARM processors in them. That way you can install full Windows and then when you're out it's an uncompromised android.
C1QC8NNODsw;Love the vid! 😎👌🏻
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin make video about new royal folding phone !! ❤
C1QC8NNODsw;When you're rich and have everything = everything is boring
C1QC8NNODsw;0:00 I think we pretty much know it
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin cradling a baby “ohhhhhhh this is a big boi.....”
C1QC8NNODsw;Should I forget 5g and keep my s7edge to save mony
C1QC8NNODsw;I own a S5 neo and it still works perfectly
C1QC8NNODsw;Austins gets tired of smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: Hello guys, this is Austin imma end this mans career
C1QC8NNODsw;Them human races 🔥🔥🔥
C1QC8NNODsw;Love him or hate him
C1QC8NNODsw;He’s spitting facts
C1QC8NNODsw;When Samsung dropped the headphone jack Tim Cook stroked his dongle so hard it eroded.
C1QC8NNODsw;I can't really afford a new phone, so I'm quite happy that my iPhone 7 can do almost everything the XS can do
C1QC8NNODsw;This video explains exactly how I've been feeling about phones, I recently baught a redmi note 7 as a daily and I love it, it has its hicups since it is a 200$ phone but for 90% of what I need a smartphone for the note 7 can fulfill my needs for a fraction of the price of these flagships
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin throws away the phone I have in thumbnail
C1QC8NNODsw;Me:I feel offended
C1QC8NNODsw;Ok fine but like I still need your Google  pixel 4 review video. tHAaaaannkkss!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Omfg than you design a phone, and have great reviews with it. But good job guessing the phones tho.
C1QC8NNODsw;Soon to be 9 with addition of Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Fold 5G
C1QC8NNODsw;they need to fix software imo my iphone is such a glitchy pos im ready to swap to android
C1QC8NNODsw;I miss the days when a phone was just a phone, not a symbol of social status.
C1QC8NNODsw;Go to the gym for watching Netflix,!!
C1QC8NNODsw;y tho?🤔
C1QC8NNODsw;im doing fine with my iphone 6s :)
C1QC8NNODsw;2019: I’m OVER smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;2020: hey GUYS I love smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;he is wearing my dream shoes Austin plz send them to me lmao
C1QC8NNODsw;I would still use my Motorola Droid Turbo that I bought in late 2015 if it had expandable storage.
C1QC8NNODsw;Yeah I miss the Verizon Galaxy s3 days of phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Hence I “downgraded” from an XR to an 8 and now to an SE. Smartphones are controlling our reality, they need to be put back where they belong! As a convenience and communicator NOT our only source of entertainment!
C1QC8NNODsw;2018 is the year of smartphone innovation 💡
C1QC8NNODsw;Whatttt Austin has the yellow human races. Makes me wonder if he’s secretly a sneaker head🤔
C1QC8NNODsw;"Totally agree with this. Great work; great video."
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m thinking of extendable phones. Something you can extend with a screen unrolling from one side.
C1QC8NNODsw;"""7 flagship phones"" - something doesn't feel right here."
C1QC8NNODsw;That note 7 bit make me laugh
C1QC8NNODsw;They all just phones.  I haven’t upgrade my phone in 2 years...and i probably will try to keep this one another 2
C1QC8NNODsw;Yep, probably won't need to upgrade when I got 5000mAh battery.
C1QC8NNODsw;I know! Now a day I pray my phone last me for 4 to 5 years so I don't have to buy a new.
C1QC8NNODsw;Start bringing back all of the features that have been taken away (headphone jack, microSD, easily replaceable batteries)
C1QC8NNODsw;i have a Galaxy A5(2017)  :-)
C1QC8NNODsw;"My first phone was the iphone 6 in 2015, and my second phone was the XS in 2019. I will only be upgrading if the phone breaks or when there is ""substantial"" innovation."
C1QC8NNODsw;*Samsung finally masters making the most advanced looking smartphone ever
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin evans: im bored
C1QC8NNODsw;Agree I'm done upgrading my phone every 2 years and I'm back with my Samsung galaxy s7 edge it's good enough for me
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin next in line for a podcast :3
C1QC8NNODsw;Bro I really want those shoes!
C1QC8NNODsw;Having John in the video was a very welcome surprise.
C1QC8NNODsw;As for the video i totally agree with your opinions. Smartphones are really burning nowadays, I think there are out of ideas and really packed in everything they could.
C1QC8NNODsw;I kind of like the improvements in processors year over year.
C1QC8NNODsw;What about the upcoming Essential phone 2?
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhone had the same design in front for 10 years. I really doubt they changed the phone designs
C1QC8NNODsw;I want my device to have a telescope feature in near future..
C1QC8NNODsw;"""i'm over smartphones?"""
C1QC8NNODsw;Okkay lets move to hybrid notebook then
C1QC8NNODsw;Watching this on a square
C1QC8NNODsw;This is the reason why I keep my pixel 2xl. 😁😁😁
C1QC8NNODsw;6:25 MKBHD can do that.
C1QC8NNODsw;I don't even have a phone 😂
C1QC8NNODsw;i still have my iPhone 6s and haven't upgraded since, its all i need
C1QC8NNODsw;This is what I've been saying for years now 😁 Phones basically became home appliances. And almost nobody gets excited about fridges, microwaves or washing machines.
C1QC8NNODsw;I just wamt something i can play steam games on
C1QC8NNODsw;I'll just upgrade when my phone doesn't want to work anymore.
C1QC8NNODsw;Thank you Austin for this video. I thought I was the only one bored of smartphones in 2019.
C1QC8NNODsw;That's why I bought the Razer phone 2, different experience than the others
C1QC8NNODsw;Keep the 24 fps videos 🙌🏻🙌🏻
C1QC8NNODsw;True advance now is in software, the definitive hardware is already settled and only needs refining
C1QC8NNODsw;Oh well time for the flip phone again
C1QC8NNODsw;After the note 10 launching without a headphone jack, me too.
C1QC8NNODsw;I'll still review them but I won't be happy about it 😔
C1QC8NNODsw;Just wait for X amount of years there will probably be a hologram phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;They need to focus on lighter batteries and software optimization.
C1QC8NNODsw;we're reaching the 11th dimenion
C1QC8NNODsw;yea.. whens the AR stuff gonna come out
C1QC8NNODsw;Thank you for making this and telling the truth Austin.
C1QC8NNODsw;Just got a Note 10/10+ ad 😂
C1QC8NNODsw;0:01 hes right
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m waiting for Apple to release something incredible again. They have the ability to make a truly revolutionary piece of technology that’s completely different to anything that already exists.
C1QC8NNODsw;Hopefully we see some better flexible phones next year. Foregoing that, I hope Samsung has the under-screen camera next year, if not, it's going to be another unrevolutionary year.
C1QC8NNODsw;I plan on keeping my XR for 5 years
C1QC8NNODsw;The real next step for smartphones (tech in general) is bringing innovation to developing/lower income markets
C1QC8NNODsw;And that's why I always had Xperia phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;This is so true!!
C1QC8NNODsw;You know this reminds me of phone blocks
C1QC8NNODsw;We getting old hahahhahaha
C1QC8NNODsw;I stopped at the iPhone 6s
C1QC8NNODsw;Sorry guys.. let me know when there’s an all oled flip phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Except when it's an iPhone, because you're a certified iSheep.
C1QC8NNODsw;OP7 Pro is great, and got me excited.
C1QC8NNODsw;I feel the same. I even got my first iPhone recently just because I've always liked phones and been rooting and stuff for a while on the Android side. But after like ten years I got bored so I tried iPhone. Using that now. Got bored with iOS in about 4 hours. Oh well I'm over it too.
C1QC8NNODsw;Just changed from a note9 to a unihertz atom. Love the little thing.
C1QC8NNODsw;That’s why I still have my iPhone 6s
C1QC8NNODsw;"Austin: ""I'm done with smartphones now"""
C1QC8NNODsw;"Everyone else: ""enjoy your dumb phone"""
C1QC8NNODsw;Jokes on you I’ve never owned a smartphone
C1QC8NNODsw;3:18 how did he open the camera app?
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m not sure of Austin’s point in relation to the title. 15/20 years ago smartphones were the minority of all cellphones.
C1QC8NNODsw;I still use an iPhone 6s and it can do everything I need and is still fast on the iOS 13 beta
C1QC8NNODsw;I wanna know what the Simpsons have to say about this.
C1QC8NNODsw;And yet, legions of people fight over which version of the same thing is the best... Clueless
C1QC8NNODsw;Still using my iPhone 7 Plus 256 GB
C1QC8NNODsw;It still works
C1QC8NNODsw;The no headphone jack is a big no thanks from me, would rather see them release fewer but better phones is that just me?
C1QC8NNODsw;I get your point and i agree with you. There is no significant difference in design & performance but the prices are hitting sky 😔😔😔😔
C1QC8NNODsw;I'll keep my Moto Z3 until it dies people just get new phones every year to show off
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones  need not be made Evey year
C1QC8NNODsw;Says that the future might be folding phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Every folding phone in the 2000s: Am I a joke to you?
C1QC8NNODsw;That flex with the Yellow Human Races and the AJ1 “LA to Chicago”
C1QC8NNODsw;I just love my iPhone SE
C1QC8NNODsw;Thats why I still have my iphone 6s
C1QC8NNODsw;I want to hear an Austin Evans and Jon Rettinger podcast! That would be cool.
C1QC8NNODsw;Well I'm over u austin
C1QC8NNODsw;It has simply reach saturation
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin don’t like the rectangle shape so y don’t they make a circle one 😂
C1QC8NNODsw;Watching on my Oneplus One using TugaPowerN61. I don't feel like I'm missing out on much from the newer phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;Yup, after I brought my iPhone XS Max straight out that’s when I knew that this phone will indeed be my last phone for a while.
C1QC8NNODsw;Most people will upgrade to a newer phone for features that they’ll never really use all to upgrade again when the chances present themselves.
C1QC8NNODsw;The Note 7 was the last of the interesting phones for me, they all started looking the same after that.
C1QC8NNODsw;1:14 Why would I want anything added to the said rectangle? Just for the design sake? No, thanks, I love the clean minimal look.
C1QC8NNODsw;"""smartphones are boring now"""
C1QC8NNODsw;But still praises and wows at every iphone release...
C1QC8NNODsw;This whole video I was bothered by the fact that Austin's shirt and shoes color didn't match exactly.
C1QC8NNODsw;02:11 hahahaha
C1QC8NNODsw;I just got the XR, I ain’t getting a new phone for 3 or 4 years
C1QC8NNODsw;too much ranting for me😢
C1QC8NNODsw;Nobody:
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin Evans: I'm OvEr SMaRtPHoNes
C1QC8NNODsw;When did austin become a Hypebeast?
C1QC8NNODsw;Well now that the basic design is perfected. They can focus on making it run longer, faster, cheaper, etc.
C1QC8NNODsw;i miss on board qwerty boards like the droid 3
C1QC8NNODsw;Remember when the note used to be a beacon for balls to the walls every phone feature cram together? Now it’s just another flagship with a stylus
C1QC8NNODsw;When did Technobuffalo move into a cave and became a conspiracy theorists with a full on beard?
C1QC8NNODsw;I already said this 2 yrs ago
C1QC8NNODsw;Cap up on the oneplus7...
C1QC8NNODsw;7:48 , u r being silly and not funny at the same time
C1QC8NNODsw;Here with my s7 edge
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphone market collapse in 2 years. Calling it.
C1QC8NNODsw;Come back to this comment in 2021.
C1QC8NNODsw;Watching this on a note 10+
C1QC8NNODsw;Good idea for the future: a contact lens with a camera for tracking fingers and a camera for taking pictures and a transparent screen
C1QC8NNODsw;Boy where u been? Missed yah dawg
C1QC8NNODsw;I want a smart flip phone (with the old school T9 keypad)
C1QC8NNODsw;Physical button on front
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: this is a note 8
C1QC8NNODsw;臘‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️
C1QC8NNODsw;"So your ""Blind test"" ended up actually going against your point for the entire video.."
C1QC8NNODsw;Your point was that all phones are so similar recently that you'd have trouble telling them apart... which you didn't have trouble at all.
C1QC8NNODsw;can't even frckin afford one for 5years xD
C1QC8NNODsw;I saw a note 10 ad before the video start
C1QC8NNODsw;12:30 this but to cod is pretty similar
C1QC8NNODsw;Go to the gym and watch Netflix?? Wtf is that 🤣🤣🤣
C1QC8NNODsw;if your bored give it to me 😂😂😂
C1QC8NNODsw;In 10-20 years, this video will be looking back as one of the first contents to complaint about the lack of creativity of the smartphones market.
C1QC8NNODsw;Is there any keypad non-smart mobile phone with good quality? I am looking something similar but can’t find yet.
C1QC8NNODsw;0:17 why is he comparing google phones they're not very good even in 2019. I'd just compare samsung phones or Iphones.
C1QC8NNODsw;I use my headphone jack quite often. For the foreseeable future, I won't buy a phone without one.
C1QC8NNODsw;That into was unusual
C1QC8NNODsw;#39 on trending
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple killed everything not just the design😂
C1QC8NNODsw;The 'wow' factor phone features are now on standard 2019. And that's superior. It means that normal phones get premium features. When a phone gets boring. It means its great.
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones : exist
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin : ANGER
C1QC8NNODsw;still waiting for the nickelodeon pear phone 🍐🙄
C1QC8NNODsw;im still satisfied with my honor 7x for 170$ on prime day of last year still works great.
C1QC8NNODsw;Is that a Koya-Blindfold from BT21 at 6:25?
C1QC8NNODsw;Can I have a phone please?😂
C1QC8NNODsw;Just a few years ago we had 7 inch tablets.....
C1QC8NNODsw;The note 10 + 5G divided by another rectangle - 1080p screen = me very underwhelmed
C1QC8NNODsw;The innovation for Samsung is make their smartphones more expensive
C1QC8NNODsw;This is the BEST MAC Channel EVER!
C1QC8NNODsw;I was thinking you are going to use     
C1QC8NNODsw;Nokia phone! (NOT SMARTPHONE!)
C1QC8NNODsw;bring back small phones!
C1QC8NNODsw;Same crap everywhere ! Nokia era the best era with new designs each time ! 🤯🤯
C1QC8NNODsw;f u dont like it the let me hve it 😂
C1QC8NNODsw;I still use a Oneplus One so... yeah
C1QC8NNODsw;I won't be amazed till holographic phones come out
C1QC8NNODsw;watched your older videos they seem good, but this video your voice sounds like your too damn high af
C1QC8NNODsw;You clearly haven't watched unboxtherapy. There is crazy new phones all the time 🤦‍♂️
C1QC8NNODsw;Watching Smartphone evolution since 20 years. Have never been as bored as currently. I hope the folding phone gets creative ideas instead of every company doing the same kind in 3-4 years...
C1QC8NNODsw;I used to have to have the lastest and greatest in iPhone and Android. Now, I definitely am happy keeping a fun much longer and do not feel that I'm missing out on a must have
C1QC8NNODsw;"Did he just say ""go to the gym, and you are watching Netflix ""? Ah yes, everybody loves those people that do that, am I right?"
C1QC8NNODsw;You want an upgrade, it’s called reality, it’s really cool, check it out, I know it sounds weird but here’s how to do it: you actually go outside and live your life. There ya go
C1QC8NNODsw;Flip phones will make a come back in the 2020’s with smartphone-esque capabilities. iFlip 2022
C1QC8NNODsw;"Half of the ""tech"" youtubers I call ""mobile tech youtubers"" because cellphones are their own category"
C1QC8NNODsw;Just a reminder
C1QC8NNODsw;You shouldn't throw phones in the bin
C1QC8NNODsw;Sees galaxy s10
C1QC8NNODsw;Me watching on a galaxy note 3
C1QC8NNODsw;I see your point!
C1QC8NNODsw;Air gesture from S4 are now back on Note 10 :)))). New features guys
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: i quit smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;If You Are Over Them You Can Give Them To Me.
C1QC8NNODsw;Simple As That ?
C1QC8NNODsw;    Edit: Guys I Was Kiding Don't Take Things Too Seriously
C1QC8NNODsw;I have a LG Phoenix 3  and I love it
C1QC8NNODsw;Lol... we all asked for this....  and still. 😂😂😂
C1QC8NNODsw;A phone is a phone as a computer a computer!  You just gonna have to wait 3 years for new technology. Great idea throw your phone away and see how bad you miss it.
C1QC8NNODsw;666k views. 😅
C1QC8NNODsw;0:52 this boi has original Human Races
C1QC8NNODsw;Dude really put the pixel 3 💀💀
C1QC8NNODsw;What shoe is Austin wearing at 0:54?
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung officially releases 10 flagships a year (including A90 and Galaxy Fold)
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones gotten boring! I agree when the first one was it was more exciting!
C1QC8NNODsw;This Video would have been delayed by five more years if new smartphones were released once every two years
C1QC8NNODsw;I see no need to update my phone
C1QC8NNODsw;I miss my Sidekick 3
C1QC8NNODsw;The Austin Evan from 2030 is laughing while watching this video
C1QC8NNODsw;Wait till apple release the new iPhone and he'll be saying something else.
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones aren't changing much & you could easily keep the same one for 4 or 5 years...
C1QC8NNODsw;So what they we made them more fragile? Glass backs for all!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Amazing video bro
C1QC8NNODsw;666k views
C1QC8NNODsw;"""Phones are boring"""
C1QC8NNODsw;Me: I have never had a phone for more than 1 hour
C1QC8NNODsw;you know video is going to be extra dope when jon shows up
C1QC8NNODsw;still dont know what they want exactly triangle phones ?
C1QC8NNODsw;Whats the instrumental hes using in the video at 2:15 ?
C1QC8NNODsw;I really want that moto razr smart flip phone, that concept needs to get real and get in my pocket right now.
C1QC8NNODsw;Start to miss the Nokia era when every mobile design are so different @@
C1QC8NNODsw;"Not as ""smart"" but definitely more creative back then~"
C1QC8NNODsw;Go to the gym, watch netflix you could have a bigger screen lmao netflix & gym??
C1QC8NNODsw;Put another camera in to sell next years phone until eventually the entire back panel consists of cameras.
C1QC8NNODsw;Then one manufacturer will say there are too many cameras and make it possible to do more with less and charge a premium.
C1QC8NNODsw;The only thing I'm looking forward to is innovation in battery, and camera technology. Imagine a dslr quality camera on your phone that lasts up to a week without charging.
C1QC8NNODsw;Remember that flip phone that was also had Android? That was neat.
C1QC8NNODsw;Nobody:
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: WoOoOoOoW ThAtS a BIG BOY
C1QC8NNODsw;I never thought Justin could flex on me anymore than he already has. But now he flexes on me by wearing pharell nmd's
C1QC8NNODsw;We are waiting for Apple to come with a revolutionizing design, so everyone else can make a better version of it
C1QC8NNODsw;Talking about amazing innovative folding phones (Samsung,...) like they weren't aware that the ZTE Axon M came out two years ago. Sounds like selective amnesia.
C1QC8NNODsw;bro, iron your shirt
C1QC8NNODsw;16k views 16min ago. Perfectly balanced....as all things should be.
C1QC8NNODsw;Give me a double-screen smartphone with a 2nd screen that slides out. The technology is there and it won't be that much thicker considering current display tech.
C1QC8NNODsw;It's all about the Gucci Smart Toilet  ™
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin... I hope after this video you get rid of your smartphone... As you are “over smartphones”
C1QC8NNODsw;Not for me, I still have an iPhone 6s. I still have a lot more to experience
C1QC8NNODsw;The irony of this video being followed by an ad for a company selling refurbished used smartphones 🤷🏻‍♂️😅
C1QC8NNODsw;Awesome video!
C1QC8NNODsw;This is one of those videos made just for the sake of making a video.
C1QC8NNODsw;You are exhAUSTINg!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Who can hear the screen while smartphone are changing in the generation
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple not competing with Android in 2019, Austin Evans is OVER smartphones lol
C1QC8NNODsw;I think the perfect smartphone will be the one that would have the ability to auto heal it self using nano bots. Flash forward 150 years from now
C1QC8NNODsw;No now we need a shades with smartphone features
C1QC8NNODsw;Actual use of phones are just over ruled with stupid multi-purpose utilities
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple saw this video and thus started selling Apple Card
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin I don’t know if ur going to read this but I would like to know if I could send u my old laptop and u could write me and note with the stuff  of what should I buy to upgrade it and send it back. I’m a huge Fan and I’m planning to buy the Brooke vs pro gaming set up but I’m going to buy the cheap one
C1QC8NNODsw;He didn't spot me in the trash can >:D
C1QC8NNODsw;I thought this was logics channel
C1QC8NNODsw;Blackberry Passport SE will always be my favorite phone. Unique in every way!
C1QC8NNODsw;Well, I've felt like this the last 4 years. There are really no big difference in performance or features any longer. The potential of the smartphones have plateaued. Maybe the cameras are still evolving.. But that will come to an end aswell.
C1QC8NNODsw;Very interesting POV Austin....Kudos!!
C1QC8NNODsw;There's also less max storage, the S10+ can go up to 1TB whereas the Note 10 only goes up to 512GB
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m on iPhone 6s
C1QC8NNODsw;We need new generation of computers.
C1QC8NNODsw;Something completely different.
C1QC8NNODsw;OP7 Pro is still the best smartphone imo
C1QC8NNODsw;They're perfecting phones with incremental upgrades and re-iterations of the same larger concept instead of trying to create a completely new device concept now, except for maybe foldable phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;It was bound to happen and I'm glad it did. I'd rather have a beautiful smartphone that does everything I need or want it to instead of a wacky new product that will go through hundreds of design and sales cycles and revisions before getting to a point where it is even in the same realm as a smartphone of today when it comes to features, or productivity, or ease of use or simply, just getting things done. There may be a future with a different product but I don't think smartphones will ever not be the staple they are now. Everything else will be an add-on or peripheral, like smart-glasses or smart-watches. I don't believe they will or should become our main devices in at least the near future.
C1QC8NNODsw;Title: I'm over smart phone
C1QC8NNODsw;My brain: what is Austin gonna use dumb phone?
C1QC8NNODsw;"When we hit the under screen cameras and ""pure rectangles"", we gotta get back to physical keyboards like the f(x) and Planet Gemini."
C1QC8NNODsw;Its my boy Koya on Austin's face
C1QC8NNODsw;Can I have one?
C1QC8NNODsw;we just need MO POWA BABY!
C1QC8NNODsw;U just realized this?  It's something I've noticed for years now
C1QC8NNODsw;#50 on trending
C1QC8NNODsw;Im done with smart phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;     puts ipad in pocket
C1QC8NNODsw;Im OVER smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;Here is my question... when are wearables actually gonna replace our phones... I wouldn't mind a google glass or a smartwatch as my main device and an ultra-thin phablet and an interface companion when needed...
C1QC8NNODsw;all i want is headphone jack i dont want 4 or 5 cameras all i want is jack and thats all
C1QC8NNODsw;I think the biggest innovation at the moment is located on our wrists :)
C1QC8NNODsw;Hi hi I'm new and I think that somebody needs to make a circle phone 📱➡⭕
C1QC8NNODsw;I use my phone for 4 years and that's only because my storage runs out or it starts to fail on me
C1QC8NNODsw;I’ve got the XS MAX 256GB and I’m not upgrading as I’m very happy with it. No point. Going to go sim free and see how long it lasts.
C1QC8NNODsw;Do you guys remember the Sharp Aquos Crystal?
C1QC8NNODsw;Anyone else notice the subtle flex in shoe choice
C1QC8NNODsw;We need a circle phone
C1QC8NNODsw;We need to drastically change the form factor without sacrificing functionality
C1QC8NNODsw;i change my phone 3 times in the past 10 years. They all feel the same but better performance
C1QC8NNODsw;Iphone 11: Allow me to intro-
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: No, you 're boring
C1QC8NNODsw;When I was young, I was told that by 2020, we would have been able to cure all cancers, colonize Mars, have flying cars and live to 150 years old. As it turned out, we got none of that but instead, we got really powerful and expensive cell phones. I felt duped.
C1QC8NNODsw;The iPhone didn‘t kill Smartphone-Design - it were the competitors who FOLLOWED the iPhone-Design. 😊
C1QC8NNODsw;As a germophobe I feel violated that you made contact with that bin in the thumbnail
C1QC8NNODsw;Have we reached smartphone nirvana?
C1QC8NNODsw;Thats why I have a Blackberry Key :D
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys smartphone here I'm sick of austin
C1QC8NNODsw;Absolute true.... Give this man a medal
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm gonna get the note 10+. But that phone I will try to keep for at least three years.
C1QC8NNODsw;Android Released Smartphone
C1QC8NNODsw;     - Austin: Boring
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple Released Smarthphone
C1QC8NNODsw;     - Austin:This is the Best Smartphone
C1QC8NNODsw;Great content
C1QC8NNODsw;A saw a phone with a 360 vr cmera. I forgot the name but that is different.
C1QC8NNODsw;When technology matures is should come down in price... Phones are offering the same and sometimes less of an experience with a growing price tag.
C1QC8NNODsw;My dude felt the home button and thought it was a note 8
C1QC8NNODsw;After watching this video,
C1QC8NNODsw;Me: damn it which box I put my Nokia 3310.
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung removing headphone jack?!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Damn apple 😠
C1QC8NNODsw;...soo...you wanna go back to a flip top (flip phone)?
C1QC8NNODsw;What's the game at 9:21?
C1QC8NNODsw;Same kinda can be said for cars 😢
C1QC8NNODsw;Finally someone in the smartphone YouTube community talking sense
C1QC8NNODsw;I mean you can give it to me
C1QC8NNODsw;hEy gUys tHis is AuSSTIIIN!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;1.we know its you austin
C1QC8NNODsw;2.this is the intro since like 20 decades
C1QC8NNODsw;please tell me all my sneaker heads saw Austin with those human races??
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones have been gone since prices hit the $1,000 mark.  Please do more reviews on laptops.  Thanks.
C1QC8NNODsw;AR and VR totally hands free AI heads up visual interface.
C1QC8NNODsw;There is something will happen is underscreen camera
C1QC8NNODsw;John looks good with beard
C1QC8NNODsw;He just realized right now .
C1QC8NNODsw;I really miss the crazy design of the old Nokia phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Folding phones did have a rough launch, but so did the Switch and look at the Switch now.
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones are just a basic need nowadays, although having the best of the best is not worth it anymore.
C1QC8NNODsw;Almost anyone could do with a mid-range devices nowadays.
C1QC8NNODsw;samsung killing headphone jack is priceless
C1QC8NNODsw;I used my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, which I bought in 2012, until I had to upgrade to the Note9.....that's 6 years.....
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin, what’s your PO Box. Im gonna send you an iron 😂😂😂😂
C1QC8NNODsw;Youtubers: we are bored of bezels in phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Also YouTubers: But it's not exciting
C1QC8NNODsw;The future has to be holographic displays
C1QC8NNODsw;he felt like logic.. bobby Tarantino
C1QC8NNODsw;gaming phones would make sense if qualcomm made special processors that have a more powerful gpu and if devs pushed graphics in games
C1QC8NNODsw;get speech therapy
C1QC8NNODsw;This is why I am getting librem 5 the best phone ever
C1QC8NNODsw;So your over smartphones right can i have your samsung s8 lol
C1QC8NNODsw;The battery life is the new innovation
C1QC8NNODsw;It's just a phone. Why are we paying laptop prices for them.
C1QC8NNODsw;Plus, once the head phone jack is gone. I have no need for a smart phone
C1QC8NNODsw;It's true, I STILL use my Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 and im happy with it.
C1QC8NNODsw;Clickbaity thumbnail...😒
C1QC8NNODsw;One K on flagships has to stop!
C1QC8NNODsw;That iphone keeping making boring smartphones 🤔

C1QC8NNODsw;07:44:00 AM
C1QC8NNODsw;Damn clickbait.  Nice video though
C1QC8NNODsw;"This video is 5 years late... Still using my OnePlus One with only minor inconveniences in features I give up on. ;)"
C1QC8NNODsw;Oh Austin Evans, you just lost your satisfaction in what you have
C1QC8NNODsw;Nobody:
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: Smartphones are kinda boring now
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin sounds the same at 1.5x speed, it's a superpower.
C1QC8NNODsw;Ok but like your KOYA SLEEP MASK
C1QC8NNODsw;IRON HAS LEFT CHAT
C1QC8NNODsw;Go the gym and watch Neflix? Ok
C1QC8NNODsw;we do a lot of things with our smartphones.
C1QC8NNODsw;call and sms : Am i joke to you? 😔😔😔
C1QC8NNODsw;COUGH What about the folding phone. It will be pretty cool if they can get it right.
C1QC8NNODsw;Good thing for consumers like us. We wouldn't feel the need to upgrade after just a few months of buying a new phone anymore. 👍👍
C1QC8NNODsw;Now
C1QC8NNODsw;They will all focus on the processing power of chips
C1QC8NNODsw;To when smart  wrist watch can render a midrange title windows games
C1QC8NNODsw;Its funny because I still use my lg v20. I can export Instagram videos and even edit 4k files in kinemaster. I also download and play d's games with emulators and like an online pokemon game. ALL THE WHILE I am able to stream this on twitch via the streamlabs app. I feel like once I finally update the only thing ill need to think about is 5g capability.
C1QC8NNODsw;Guys, there’s a whole world to explore. Who cares about phones?
C1QC8NNODsw;Whoooooo tablets with the winnnn
C1QC8NNODsw;IMO I think we have reached the peak level of development in smartphones (except for battery department) now we should focus more on non-physical aspect of smartphone like without any material body or something much more compact like a hologram technology.
C1QC8NNODsw;Still rocking my 8 Plus. I don’t see any need to upgrade for a long time.
C1QC8NNODsw;On the last Party i was we put the phones on a table and later when I wanted to pick mine up I had to flip like 10 Phones because most of them are black glas and metal slabs.
C1QC8NNODsw;Just realized it’s gonna be like the house marketing crash of 2008, at least we will be getting good phones for cheap..
C1QC8NNODsw;Dope sneakers tho
C1QC8NNODsw;I just upgraded after having an s5 for yrs. Literally almost every difference except the camera could have been done with a software update. Thats whats so obnoxious and obvious greed at this point.
C1QC8NNODsw;We need aliens that what we need
C1QC8NNODsw;I refuse to buy a new smartphone until there are 2 screens. For $1000 I want a screen on the back too
C1QC8NNODsw;I have the s8 plus. Its just as good as any of these phones if we are gonna be real. Specs can only be so good I'm not upgrading until my phone craps out
C1QC8NNODsw;i think having 2 versions of the note 10 was the DUMBEST thing samsung has ever done.
C1QC8NNODsw;I think also we need new battery technology
C1QC8NNODsw;Nice BT21 KOYA blindfold guys
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: “There have not been big leaps recently like before”
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung and Apple release new phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Y’all be wanting stuff to much make it yourself
C1QC8NNODsw;You and Jonathan are the OG of isheep peeps out there!
C1QC8NNODsw;2019 was the death of smartphones for me. I cannot feel excited for a phone anymore. It's just a tool for me. That's what it should have always been.
C1QC8NNODsw;Man then how about the 5g iPhone
C1QC8NNODsw;Can’t this discussion also be said for cars as well?
C1QC8NNODsw;If you are bore even with the great variety of options in Android, you most be very... very... very bore of the Apple iPhone offerings.
C1QC8NNODsw;Still rocking an s7 edge and u even looked into getting a new one because my screen is cracked. There only like $250 usd
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey Austin just subbed
C1QC8NNODsw;ASUS ROG phone 2 beast
C1QC8NNODsw;still on my note 8
C1QC8NNODsw;Clickbait!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;10:23 who tf watches netflix in the gym?
C1QC8NNODsw;I wish more tech reviewers would admit the excitement of new phones has become stale.
C1QC8NNODsw;lit ep.
C1QC8NNODsw;I like how Austin uses a KOYA eye mask
C1QC8NNODsw;No HDR?
C1QC8NNODsw;I have long been at the point where the only thing making me want a new phone is mine being slow. Been rocking this iPhone 7+ since it came out. Not even sure if I’ll upgrade this year
C1QC8NNODsw;Thank god techtubers finally realising the truth..!!
C1QC8NNODsw;He's done with smartphones. Time to look for dumbphones
C1QC8NNODsw;How about Oppo Reno, Samsung Galaxy A80?
C1QC8NNODsw;they need to move to holograms
C1QC8NNODsw;Whoaaaa BIG BOIYEE
C1QC8NNODsw;Just go buy a flip phone Austin it was the best phone ever or find the best flip phone
C1QC8NNODsw;If your so tired of being on your then let it down for a while go for a walk go watch a movie or play a game you don’t always
C1QC8NNODsw;gata be on your phone makes sense right smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
C1QC8NNODsw;Ok how do my LG Spirit worked for 3 years and way did my dad buyed me S3 Neo and how PUBG runs on 1,5GB Ram and way battery is a litle bit bad?
C1QC8NNODsw;And how does it feels to hold iPhone Xs Max?
C1QC8NNODsw;How big is Note10?
C1QC8NNODsw;I got the S10+ for 500 brand new sealed lul
C1QC8NNODsw;Oh you are bored of smartphones? Oh thats alright, just aahh, pass them to me, I'm cool with that. I'll take one for the team (or as many as you have)
C1QC8NNODsw;they have brain implants that projects your phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Please make the phone thicker and put a bigger battery in smartphones 🙏
C1QC8NNODsw;I miss bezels why do some many tech you tubers despise them/ older tech from the early 2010a and older yet they generally can still do things
C1QC8NNODsw;BRUH, NO. PLEASE DON'T EVER WEAR THAT OUTFIT AGAIN AT 0:51.
C1QC8NNODsw;I see you with the human races you got the drip
C1QC8NNODsw;Or price phones like they were 5 years ago
C1QC8NNODsw;I think they're right. Apple did kill the design of phones. When I walk into a mobile phone store now it's just all rectangle screens and just ONE flip phone. Even back in 2010 the options were much better than they were now.
C1QC8NNODsw;No more smartphone for me, im switching to old school nokia. My ipad however will remain
C1QC8NNODsw;Look at the low end.
C1QC8NNODsw;Windows phones are more innovative.
C1QC8NNODsw;But I cant even get 50dollars to sell them after paying like 700
C1QC8NNODsw;True 8k, 60 fps. Phone camera :P
C1QC8NNODsw;The fold is just 2 phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple is stopping the tech evolution here..
C1QC8NNODsw;2020 Austin: this bag of peanuts has a touchscreen on it.
C1QC8NNODsw;Love the setting, aspect ration and everything. Great production!
C1QC8NNODsw;End of the day you stay with softwares, not with the features actually :/, that's where apple is successful.
C1QC8NNODsw;I totally agree. Haven't been much excited for smartphones now since the Note variations first came out. Before that was the sidekick. Already have the Note 8 and 9, not buying the 10.
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m over people saying “like” 15x per sentence.
C1QC8NNODsw;oof that phone guy rocking Aj1 SB lakers (to chicago) and Austin with the NDMs DAAAAAAAAAAAAMn xDD
C1QC8NNODsw;"The only smartphone can make me say ""wow"" is"
C1QC8NNODsw;R. I. P. Headphone jack on Samsungs like why.
C1QC8NNODsw;Your clickbaiting lured me to your video, don't disappoint me!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Am I going crazy or does Austin's voice sound weird here?
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm over your videos
C1QC8NNODsw;I would love it if more companies picked up on what the Asus Padfone X did.
C1QC8NNODsw;Wow never realized this. I have to agree.
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin :smartphones are dead
C1QC8NNODsw;His channel is mainly about being a nerd on phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Such a first world problem lmao
C1QC8NNODsw;Where do you go from here?   How about an affordable phone?
C1QC8NNODsw;We removed the headphone jack in the note 10
C1QC8NNODsw;say sike right now
C1QC8NNODsw;I bought a iPhone 7 Plus last summer and it’s still doing great! No need to upgrade atm
C1QC8NNODsw;For me IDC because phones are great. But tablet are awesome.
C1QC8NNODsw;The smartphone is gonna blend in with PC. What Samsung and Microsoft are doing: Blending Samsung Decks with Windows where you can switch seamlessly. I actually also like the Huawei desktop. I hope smartphone will get better desktop functions.
C1QC8NNODsw;Yes, phones are way too rectangular.
C1QC8NNODsw;Always the same, just a little bit different from the others. Back when BlackBerry was popular, that was a fun time for phones
C1QC8NNODsw;The changing of phones from Basic to advanced is cool tech of 2019.
C1QC8NNODsw;You make it sound like a consumer problem, that the smartphonemarket has gone stale. My wallet and mother-earth are thankful, that we have reached a point, where it makes sense to keep the phone longer.
C1QC8NNODsw;There's still room for improvement on smartphones but we don't have the technology yet
C1QC8NNODsw;for example is the galaxy fold if samsung had the technology for it it would've been successful but they are the ones creating the technology for a folding phones so expect that other smartphone companies will make samsung phones as a reference to make their's better
C1QC8NNODsw;This video speaks right into my heart. Probably that's why the Galaxy fold talks the talk for my heart. That is the big change the Smartphone world needs!
C1QC8NNODsw;Interesting subject
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm getting the galaxy note 10 plus tomorrow and my parents said that that would be the last phone they would pay for me. I'm totally fine with that because I don't need minor upgrades every year. I'm sure the galaxy note 10 plus can survive for 4 years without becoming way behind in big smartphone changes. I totally agree with Austin.
C1QC8NNODsw;Just bring back the 70's,80's, 90's brick phones if you wanna keep complaining about smartphone. Lol.
C1QC8NNODsw;I went tried my old phone for a bit (Samsung galaxy j5 2015) and realised how much I appreciate removable battery headphone Jack and a phone that fits in hand and weirdly bezels and a home button.
C1QC8NNODsw;?
C1QC8NNODsw;New innovation ideas for phones:
C1QC8NNODsw;1. Inbuilt projector
C1QC8NNODsw;laughs in samsung smart fridge
C1QC8NNODsw;I have a 7 year old Samsung Galaxy Ace... I can only imagine how many phones it has survived that was produced after I got one....
C1QC8NNODsw;That's why Samsung is making the Galaxy Fold
C1QC8NNODsw;I think they should look back in to google glass
C1QC8NNODsw;This is where I'm at. This year will be a first for me, I won't be upgrading. I have a one plus 6 and it's enough. Nothing is so far ahead that I must splash out on a new one.
C1QC8NNODsw;Can we bring back sliding keyboards?
C1QC8NNODsw;Wake me up when roll up screens and phones built in glasses get here
C1QC8NNODsw;Omg guys I want you guys right now comment a great idea for a smartphone trust me its not that easy and it has to be realistic and new and innovating and can work and people will buy also list a price
C1QC8NNODsw;I think the s8 was the pinnacle of design I would pick that phone over any other if I HAD to
C1QC8NNODsw;I have one word for you... 𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬
C1QC8NNODsw;What kind of laptop he is using here 3:22
C1QC8NNODsw;Shit costs too much. I have a one plus 5t and wanted to go for s10+ or op7 pro. Instead a made a ryzen 2nd gen linux workstation with a 1070 for 1100$. Couldn’t be any happier.
C1QC8NNODsw;Everything is expensive so
C1QC8NNODsw;When you see something in the video that you want to find a comment about but you cant find the comment:
C1QC8NNODsw;Alright, I'll just write this myself then
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphone is a device to spy you watch you make you crazy first they know everything about you then suicide algorithm will use this knowledge against you like it is in western civilisation
C1QC8NNODsw;I think its a good thing, people need to buy less smartphones. Could help with the environmental problems
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: there’s not really any notches
C1QC8NNODsw;pulls out minecraft
C1QC8NNODsw;Would you imagine if they entirely got rid of the front facing camera just to sell you a beseless phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;Android in 10 years : boring
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhone in 10 years   : dual sim
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones will become our PCs. Thats when phone tech will be cool again
C1QC8NNODsw;5g
C1QC8NNODsw;I have a Samsung galaxy A7 2016 and an iPad Pro 11.... I'm satisfied.
C1QC8NNODsw;Huge losses for the company, huge gains for the environment.
C1QC8NNODsw;I do miss my old galaxy s4 with its removable battery but the software was meh.
C1QC8NNODsw;Your a noob at guessing smartphones you say owww a home botton and then note 8???? Fingerprint on the back and the. Nokia 9 ( underscreen) lol.
C1QC8NNODsw;First world problems: I cant satisfy my consumer addiction of buying new stuff because its not cool anymore!
C1QC8NNODsw;I think they should just release a phone every 2 years now so they can actually do some r&d
C1QC8NNODsw;Modular phones. New modules every year... I dont know. Maybe that could help companies for 3-4 years I guess?
C1QC8NNODsw;That thumbnail triggered me.
C1QC8NNODsw;I dont even have a phone
C1QC8NNODsw;I`m over too, because there is no or no big new innovation coming..
C1QC8NNODsw;the newest Design is the Samsung FOLD
C1QC8NNODsw;The next revolution in smartphones Will not be a smartphone
C1QC8NNODsw;Still waiting for a transparent pear phone, that would be sick
C1QC8NNODsw;Last time I came this early I wasn’t happy about it
C1QC8NNODsw;Well, now get over your glasses then
C1QC8NNODsw;You say that then you'll gush over the iPhone 11.
C1QC8NNODsw;Then do giveaway...
C1QC8NNODsw;Completely left out how Apple ID slowing down previous generation iPhones with each new one they come out with forcing people to move forward
C1QC8NNODsw;And then the Pixel 4 came... And changed how we interact with our phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;yooo thats a bt21 koya headband
C1QC8NNODsw;The reason for this is because phones have went from luxury items to commodities.
C1QC8NNODsw;Also there is only so much you can do with physical hardware. Especially, when the device is a touch screen
C1QC8NNODsw;Iron your shirt bro
C1QC8NNODsw;Legend says it's impossible to get a heart from Austin
C1QC8NNODsw;you have a good point but don't forget this new phones faster than old phones that is very great thing
C1QC8NNODsw;Sony needs to make Xperia Play 2.
C1QC8NNODsw;their all the same now same chip set same ram same great cameras
C1QC8NNODsw;I wanna shape a phone as a pear
C1QC8NNODsw;04:17:00 AM
C1QC8NNODsw;Are you sure there isn’t going to be a Note 10 5G? Samsung announced it at Unpacked.
C1QC8NNODsw;He has become a boomer
C1QC8NNODsw;what do you want?  flying phone?
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m still using my s7 edge. No need to upgrade
C1QC8NNODsw;From Samsung lineup for most people A20, A30, A40 and A50 will be more than enough.
C1QC8NNODsw;The Video is 12:55 minutes long, no problem
C1QC8NNODsw;Atm I have a mi8 with pixel experience and it can do everything I need and more. I decided for my self that the next phone I would buy would be one with a nano led display. That would be a game changer over oled
C1QC8NNODsw;I know what you mean, I had zero info on the Note this year except that infinity o. I used to follow these spec dumps like gospel, now I have very little interest at all. The phone market is saturated and there is no hardware they're improving on massively any more, but right now I am supposed to pay for a phone that is laptop money? I think I am done being foolish, let us look at AMD, Intel and Nvidia hehehe as ARM CPUs start slowly checking in.
C1QC8NNODsw;stop at 0:00
C1QC8NNODsw;Iphone 20 coming out in 2023 2 days after the iphone 18
C1QC8NNODsw;I haven't changed my phone since the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Will hold on to it till it dies off.
C1QC8NNODsw;What I truly want to know is how you and the other tech reviewers will change your formula for new smartphones coming. Now that you’ve made a whole video on it being stale, will you be able to continue the same phone overviews and reviews with the same excitement factor that these companies expect each year.
C1QC8NNODsw;blind test stolen from mkbhd
C1QC8NNODsw;No  headphone jack ?
C1QC8NNODsw;-mentions physical button
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 8!
C1QC8NNODsw;It's sad...
C1QC8NNODsw;"That's not how it works Austin. Maybe you don't know it yet. We're waiting for a new phone to come out that'll catch your eye and you make a video about it, titled something like ""I'm back into smartphones again"". Not the smartest YouTuber that's for sure."
C1QC8NNODsw;I honestly prefer a thicker device but having it lighter. When a device is thin I worry about bending wayyyy too much
C1QC8NNODsw;I am over flagship phones. Phones like the 3a are the way forward.
C1QC8NNODsw;IM UNDER SMARTPHONES 😂 I had to sry
C1QC8NNODsw;Love the vids
C1QC8NNODsw;Who watches Netflix at the gym?
C1QC8NNODsw;Well mid-range is where the most of good stuff is nowadays.
C1QC8NNODsw;flip phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Just a thought but maybe the future of smartphones will be more focused on software rather than the hardware. There are endless possibilities when it comes to creative ways to fully utilize the hardware we already have.
C1QC8NNODsw;I think the biggest thing could be a simple phone. A phone with more modern specs with old features. (Headphone jack, Touch ID, etc.)
C1QC8NNODsw;Does anyone know what shoes jon is wearing?
C1QC8NNODsw;And that's the exact reason why apple are focusing on services.
C1QC8NNODsw;Or maybe you just don’t have first hand early access to the phones and events anymore?
C1QC8NNODsw;i want a phone that can run gta 5 and made by  steam or something
C1QC8NNODsw;Kinda bored?  You could read a book. Talk to a girl. You'll figure it out.
C1QC8NNODsw;again a whole video that's is based on a a reviewer that has the new phone everytime it comes out. the problem is that most people upgrade their phone after 2 years, 3 sometimes 6... believe me after 3 years you do see a difference in performance camera etc. you forget that the main purpose of a smartphone its software and allowing people to be more productive, socialise, and get entertained. saying that its a problem that the design is the same its like saying its a problem that laptops look the same since the first laptop (a screen + keyboards that shuts ) which is wrong.
C1QC8NNODsw;Aye Koya sleeping mask, any BTS fans here??? :3
C1QC8NNODsw;I want another Sony Xperia Play.
C1QC8NNODsw;And this is why you should switch to a Nokia smh.
C1QC8NNODsw;Dead industry
C1QC8NNODsw;Every industry has stagnation at some point...
C1QC8NNODsw;Good video
C1QC8NNODsw;I don't think 2009-2018 is 10 years🤔
C1QC8NNODsw;hologram phones are the endgame.. but before that.. glass phones first..
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm waiting on project Ara from Google. I don't think it's dead considering they made a newer patent of the idea of a modular phone back in January of this year.
C1QC8NNODsw;I don't have one, and never will. I use my house phone to talk and my PC to skype and email etcetra.
C1QC8NNODsw;Main Reason I never upgraded to  a smart phone was they insist on gluing it together, which makes it almost impossible to repair and even the basic, replace the battery after 18 months to 24 months.
C1QC8NNODsw;I clicked the video... I got a hauwei Ad..
C1QC8NNODsw;Just to further prove his point, I just upgraded from my old ass S6 edge plus to a LG G6 and I'm happy with it.
C1QC8NNODsw;Is it just me or did Austin changed the title from I'm tired of Samsung to I'm tired of Smartphones?
C1QC8NNODsw;The shoes tho pharrels and retro ones
C1QC8NNODsw;Human satisfaction will never end.
C1QC8NNODsw;I bought a 120 dollar redmi phone 3years ago and though I have the money to buy new flagship phone, I don't see the use in getting a new phone, while my old one still is able to manage whatever I am doing now, properly. Mobile phones have become a luxury.
C1QC8NNODsw;Me too after iphone 5 and sumsung a5 everything went downhill aachoooo {iphone 6- 10 sucks}
C1QC8NNODsw;Hello everyone! Does anyone have a good website to buy a gaming laptop from? I’ve been considering buying once for a few months now and I want to make sure that I can get a solid laptop with a good price from a good website! Thank you for responding!
C1QC8NNODsw;Second I see the title. No your not
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm using my iPhone SE for 3 years and I still don't find the need to upgrade it! 🤣🤣
C1QC8NNODsw;Smart phone era is over dude
C1QC8NNODsw;Moral of the story, gaming phones are the final frontier before we inevitably reach monolithich cureved rectangular screens.
C1QC8NNODsw;2024 book iPhones are now made
C1QC8NNODsw;Yes smartphones don't have that wow factor anymore and in my opinion it's because companies release a new one every year instead of 2 or 3 years apart
C1QC8NNODsw;Galaxy fold
C1QC8NNODsw;Who Asked?
C1QC8NNODsw;Other tech YTbers: Note 10 10+
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: I'm OVER Smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;Now thats a different video
C1QC8NNODsw;i still have a S7 edge, after 3 years, it still keeps 1 day. I play games on it, yes still all over 3 years and baterry is still not exhausted. Power for games? Yes all the developers are making mobile games to be playable by as much players as possible. So when will be my time for buying of new one? i dont know ... after some crash, or I dont know :D
C1QC8NNODsw;I think keyboard phones were gone to fast, every phone was different then
C1QC8NNODsw;Galaxy fold has joined the chat
C1QC8NNODsw;This is so true
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple with wearable AR and Samsung with foldable phones should spice things up a bit soon.
C1QC8NNODsw;Why are so many top tech youtubers making videos like this.. stuff like... 'smartphones will now be obsolete' or 'I'm done with smartphones'
C1QC8NNODsw;Software upgrades....
C1QC8NNODsw;This channel probably has the worst intro of all youtube😂
C1QC8NNODsw;My OnePlus 5 works just as fine as the OnePlus 7 pro without 90hz display and a better camera
C1QC8NNODsw;They should concentrate on researching the Ultimate Battery like Infinite Battery (if possible) 🤔
C1QC8NNODsw;Foldable phones...
C1QC8NNODsw;Wish that note 7 would have exploded he would have regained interest or actually be series
C1QC8NNODsw;If folding phones succeed I think that first thing companies will try to do is lower the price.
C1QC8NNODsw;I don't like fold phones (I have a S10+), personally I will only buy another phone of he has graphene battery and infinity screen
C1QC8NNODsw;then you should gift me one😏😏😏😏😏
C1QC8NNODsw;so what the best phone to buy
C1QC8NNODsw;But then when someone tries something new he doesn't care
C1QC8NNODsw;Would be great if flip phones came back.
C1QC8NNODsw;They're pretty cool-looking if you know what your looking for, but nowadays, people are more affixiated with there apps than it was back then.
C1QC8NNODsw;Lets make triangle and circle phones
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm still waiting for the Nokia morph....
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin should really try the pyramid and it's ergonomic design
C1QC8NNODsw;Netflix and chill? Nah Netflix and gym
C1QC8NNODsw;no one pointed out that they both had their feet up to flex their shoes
C1QC8NNODsw;And smartphones are over you Austin
C1QC8NNODsw;When you don't have a smartphone and they're bored with them.
C1QC8NNODsw;Do you think iphone Xr is an upgrade over iphone X and an endgame phone. I need a bigger screen
C1QC8NNODsw;Librem privacy phone (from pure.sm) to ship this quarter. True innovation again.
C1QC8NNODsw;I have one on pre order to replace my Samsung Galaxy S9+.
C1QC8NNODsw;I want to start a trend so we are gonna name names we are bias against
C1QC8NNODsw;I'll go first : hunter
C1QC8NNODsw;I apologise if your name is mentioned in the comment's
C1QC8NNODsw;Make pc build guides
C1QC8NNODsw;I was following u until u compared smartphones to PC.
C1QC8NNODsw;In 2019 it's not about the design, as all of these are pretty much the same, rather it's about value for money... some sell things for $1000 while others sell the same things for $500 or less... the choice is yours.
C1QC8NNODsw;Circle phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Windows 10 Mobile is soooo Underrated.
C1QC8NNODsw;stll rocking a Lumia 950XL and a Lumia 930 as back ups
C1QC8NNODsw;hence why im still rocking a not 8
C1QC8NNODsw;Just switch back to flip phones but give it all screen
C1QC8NNODsw;What about a 2020 version of the Sidekick?! Bring back the BlackBerry Storm?! New iteration of the Sharp Aquos 2?! There is literally so much room left for innovation in the phone game!
C1QC8NNODsw;Human Races on Austin and LA to Chi SBs on the other dude?  Youtubers getting into the sneaker game?
C1QC8NNODsw;I love android phones and I'm currently using an honor 8x but honestly the note 10 is just such a disappointment and really not a great phone
C1QC8NNODsw;You've been spoiled with tech. That's all! You were born into this, I saw it all from the beginning. It more than a phone, I don't need a laptop. 12gb of ram , ON A PHONE!? not trying to change your mind, that's just my opinion.  Thank you!
C1QC8NNODsw;Came here just to press dislike :)
C1QC8NNODsw;Well... You know there's an end to everything nothing lasts forever even pcs maybe they will last for a long time cause of the huge and enormous difference but still nothing will last forever but that's something good because when a story ends another one begins... What's the coming story after PC?
C1QC8NNODsw;Why does a phone company stop with new features and perfect the formula
C1QC8NNODsw;steve jobs is a pioneer
C1QC8NNODsw;I am still a young one, 30, to be precise, i dont own a smartphone, i just ordered a classic phone. I have the means which to buy a smartphone, looked at some of them, but i decided i will stick with my buttons and small screens. It would be a shame if i would end up, like some of the smartphone owners, sliding/wiping the screens of their phone every time they get the chance.
C1QC8NNODsw;No more headphone Jack?  Well LG phones look pretty good right about now.
C1QC8NNODsw;I have sumsung a50 and i cant really think of a reason to get s or note series
C1QC8NNODsw;Wow I appreciate the arrow in the thumbnail because I really thought you were taking a $1000 phone out of the trash can
C1QC8NNODsw;What are those shoes? Smh
C1QC8NNODsw;I got a note 10 plus in im still not satisfied. I come to realize this phone company's make the same phone over in over again with a bigger screen every year. When i said something about my note 10 plus ppl thought i was trippin lol
C1QC8NNODsw;Hi
C1QC8NNODsw;Hi
C1QC8NNODsw;"So you intentionally forgot the GALAXY a50, 60, 70..?? My a70 has a 6.7"" screen, the UFS 3 storage, sd card, 2 sim slots, headphone jack, 4500mAh battery, and a flat screen. It rocks."
C1QC8NNODsw;Lol last thing that wow me was iPhone 6s. And after that, all phones are the same....
C1QC8NNODsw;The only space in smartphone innovation now is in value.
C1QC8NNODsw;It's more bad, when now, i don't have someone to chat or connected..
C1QC8NNODsw;phone just for watching youtube, and online shoping..
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhone fold
C1QC8NNODsw;The evolution of phone specification changes or upgrades are soo slow that we just don’t notice it but if you put a phone from each year on paper and notice their differences they are fairly significant... we, especially people with access to the latest stuff have just be accustomed to the nicest features so we are basically spoilt 🤷🏻‍♂️ and as soon as companies lack to deliver on new features we bitch and cry about them being boring
C1QC8NNODsw;They play up the fact how wonderful the current phone is until six months later they came out with a better version making your current version shitty
C1QC8NNODsw;Id buy a TV stand for $900
C1QC8NNODsw;Everyone buy mid rangers. These mid rangers has more functions than flagships
C1QC8NNODsw;Wtf do you want then a pear phone??
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin really means to say “I’m over smartphones that aren’t iPhones”
C1QC8NNODsw;Why is this on trending
C1QC8NNODsw;1 of thing that made smartphone lack in innovation is they made flagship smartphone with ip rating, this can limit smartphone design.
C1QC8NNODsw;Ultimatly I want to see a phone on Glass....foldable glass or plastic. Like you see in SciFi movies and animes. Galaxy Fold is one such example of that. Who knew 20yrs ago that we would see a folding phone. That was just a fantasy thats come real.  When im talking about phone on glass. A small business card PC like thing on the bottom with retractable folding screen that pops out of it. Like those new folding tvs that pops in and out of a box. And uses Light and sensors on the specific screen to pin point what your typing on the glass. Its better to see than type this lol
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung should not release another smartphone until 3 to 4 years so they make the most BEAUTIFUL phone
C1QC8NNODsw;but pixel 4xl project soli?🤫
C1QC8NNODsw;I reckon gaming phones will be the next big thing. The ASUS ROG 2 phone is where it's going to.
C1QC8NNODsw;What’s ugly face. Hey guys this Austin ohh god.
C1QC8NNODsw;The video starts at 12:55. Thought I will save you the troubles.
C1QC8NNODsw;I agree with what your saying but the note 10+ 5G is going to be cheaper for me then my s10 5G but your right there is not much more to do to phones anymore.
C1QC8NNODsw;Im probably going to get a pixel 4 and lay low after that.
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhones are gonna turn to iPads
C1QC8NNODsw;iPads are gonna turn into MacBooks
C1QC8NNODsw;Can’t wait to buy a 183040 foot extension cord for my now portable pc.
C1QC8NNODsw;I was thinking oo this issue since last year.Phones are really good these days, they can last for a few years... there is no need for a new phone every year. Manufactures can take a year off and release a phone every 2 years or so. Which gives them enough time for R&D and also can help the environment by not making new phones every year
C1QC8NNODsw;Stop complaining and give some practical solution!
C1QC8NNODsw;What do want a flip phone with a touch screen then you'd laugh and complain about that.
C1QC8NNODsw;Human race if u know u know
C1QC8NNODsw;The note 10 is simply there to help sell the 10 plus at a higher profit margin.
C1QC8NNODsw;I’ve bought only 3 smartphones ever... iPhone 1, iPhone 4S, iPhone 7 Plus (2007, 2011, 2016) — I save money and when I DO upgrade, I really notice the differences.
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys, this is Exhausted
C1QC8NNODsw;one plus 7 pro has hella innovation tho with the display and camera
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey... Is this an anti-SAMSUNG video...
C1QC8NNODsw;As a car enthusiast I am noticing similarities with new phones and new cars. Many new cars are boring bland SUV crossover things, just as you said smartphones are differently designed rectangles.
C1QC8NNODsw;Ah but you see planned obsolencence, a great phone that is crippled by software is the largest push to make people upgrade now days.
C1QC8NNODsw;"I see where you are going, back in 2011 Sony brought out the Xperia lineup and I was super excited to get the new Xperia Play, I'm mostly into mobile gaming, retro gaming to be more exact, but, back in 2011 the mobile industry was still in the early stages, android 2.2, single core processors, etc. But, despite all this I had high hopes for the Xperia Play, it sure was unique, with a physical controller adapted to the phone, stereo speakers and first gen snapdragon processor, it sure was ahead of its time, way to ahead unfortunatelly, it didn't do to well in the market and Sony left it behind, to bad, cause even after that, there was and still is a large comunity that has programed alot of emulators based around the Xperia Plays design, even today, with its low end profile it's still a good emulator mobile, Sony tried to enovate in design with the first gen of Xperia phones, but at the end decided to keep it ""safe"" and follow the crowd, I always hoped that Sony would reconsider the Xperia Play and brought back with todays high specs, that would bring a breath of fresh air to the mobile gaming comunity, guess i'll shop ebay for and old Play for old times sake."
C1QC8NNODsw;If it were me
C1QC8NNODsw;No headphone jack = reject the phone immediately.
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 10+ is the premium version of the premium version (Note 10) of the premium version (S10+) of the premium version (S10).
C1QC8NNODsw;Saucetin...
C1QC8NNODsw;What It's absurd is when people face unlock on a secure envyronment... you know, you can have the phone without any security and just use the power button to turn on the screen...
C1QC8NNODsw;More practical security method is the fingerprinter sensor at the back
C1QC8NNODsw;When these phones hit $1100+ so easily.......that was it for me. I waited 6 months after the S8+ and was able to grab one for $440. I’ll wait for 6 months after the note 10+ and grab one for $500
C1QC8NNODsw;I totally agree !
C1QC8NNODsw;I agree. I liked when companies used to strive on design and features. Now, they all just care about maximizing profit wile making the least effort.
C1QC8NNODsw;so the galaxy s7 has a 1440p screen and the note 10 has a 1080p screen? defaq
C1QC8NNODsw;Let's be like Apple... That's the problem
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin : I'm DONE with smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple : release new iPhone
C1QC8NNODsw;Why I love to prank people by using my iPhone 2g out in public
C1QC8NNODsw;Shut up... You're just too spoiled😜
C1QC8NNODsw;i need serious help of either getting note 10 standard or s10 plus regardless price i barely use the headphone jack and dont use the micro sd slot please help me choose.
C1QC8NNODsw;We should start hologram programming it’s something the pops up from a watch. Turn it on then a holgrphaic screen will come. It will only be to show the screen to the user or the chosen people or specified people around him that the user chooses.
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys I’m exhausted
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones are jewelry at this point, especially IPhones.
C1QC8NNODsw;That's honestly what's going on phones are just getting better
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm UNDER them
C1QC8NNODsw;Buy an iPhone four, you can get tiny deathstar.
C1QC8NNODsw;this basically for the last 2 years upgrades were just not worth it in my opinion
C1QC8NNODsw;That's why galaxy fold is there.
C1QC8NNODsw;lets go back to using flip phones
C1QC8NNODsw;"Giveth me, Galaxy Fold 2, with 8.5"" screen, 6000mah 50w, DURABLE SCREEN, SD 865, s-pen, Bezeless design. GIVE ME."
C1QC8NNODsw;I got a Samsung note 10 ad. nioce!
C1QC8NNODsw;I agree with this video except for the iphone x and s8,9,10 i think was a pretty big leap and possibly the dead end for awile.
C1QC8NNODsw;I would've bought the Note 10 but no headphone jack = not interested
C1QC8NNODsw;My timeline -
C1QC8NNODsw;2020 to 2022 - underscreen front camera
C1QC8NNODsw;2022 to 2024 - decline of the usb port like the headphone jack, making wireless charging mainstream
C1QC8NNODsw;2024 to 2030 - Foldable smartphones become mainstream
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple should make a circle-shaped phone
C1QC8NNODsw;They shud start a rugged phine trend
C1QC8NNODsw;Of course smartphones are a bit stale.
C1QC8NNODsw;The problem really stems from smartphones coming out every single year with slight iterations each time.
C1QC8NNODsw;if he is over smartphones he should never use one... problem solved... oh wait he will never do that.
C1QC8NNODsw;How rich and filled with tech that you wuld think phones are crap and useless....
C1QC8NNODsw;I wana be a tech utuber 😂
C1QC8NNODsw;Wow sorry I don't know his name but its been a while because he has a beard lol
C1QC8NNODsw;This topic has been run into the ground.
C1QC8NNODsw;I am student should I buy a phone
C1QC8NNODsw;i think ill just stick with my trusty note 9
C1QC8NNODsw;"Smartphones are like ramen; they become boring after a while."
C1QC8NNODsw;I say we should all just get flip phones
C1QC8NNODsw;I think we've pretty much peaked on terms of design and useful features on a smartphone except maybe for better cameras underneath the display. If you ask me, there won't be any major design changes unless companies decided to go back to smaller phones again, which I actually believe could be a thing in the near future because going with such a change in design would not just appeal to a lot of folks who don't want to run around with a nearly 7 inch device in their pants, but it would also be great publicity in times where there's no real innovation in the smartphone industry anymore.
C1QC8NNODsw;Same thoughts over here. Maybe companies should focus on innovating mid range smartphone than their flagship phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;Ok but koya blindfold is everything
C1QC8NNODsw;I absolutely cant stand your videos anymore
C1QC8NNODsw;Ah... those philosophical videos... I’m wondering if John is YouTuber or philosopher... if phones are so boring then why don’t you change the topics on your channel. Star making videos about cars or scientific achievements. There’s a lot to cover there and still be excited
C1QC8NNODsw;Dude stfu it's good tech what are you talking about
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhone 11 piss unlock
C1QC8NNODsw;Time to check out Hawaii os thats whats next
C1QC8NNODsw;10:25 .....who watches Netflix in the gym .......😑😑😑 like seriously 😒
C1QC8NNODsw;what’s koya doing here
C1QC8NNODsw;Literally just don't use the s pen if you don't want to..., The S10 and the note 10 are used for different things so how can you compare them in that much detail
C1QC8NNODsw;Unbox Honor 9x
C1QC8NNODsw;The Sony phones differ more from other phones. Why didn't u show those?
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin: I hate smartphones now.
C1QC8NNODsw;Also Austin: The Nintendo Switch android ui is amazing!
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin one more time: What? It's technically not a phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;I dont see people switching to folding phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Why can't you guys be grateful and/or content to what we have nowadays.
C1QC8NNODsw;He felt the home button and said it was the note 8. Bruh
C1QC8NNODsw;Bring back the sliding keyboard like the sidekick.
C1QC8NNODsw;Theres a phone with a projector inside of it. Its called the blackview max 1. You should check it out
C1QC8NNODsw;Hayyyyyy guys this is Austin Texas
C1QC8NNODsw;"So what's the answer ? Stop upgrading or switch to a ""dumb"" phone ?"
C1QC8NNODsw;Finally people will stop flexing with their wacky expensive slabs
C1QC8NNODsw;They did say smart phones are gonna die in 5 years
C1QC8NNODsw;Moving to Australia has really hampered my desire to buy new phones. note 10+ 5g is $2,000 here, lol
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey, I'm wondering if anybody knows about a fairly cheap GPS watch that doesn't require a phone to be connected to. If so, please let me know!
C1QC8NNODsw;"I absolutly agree. I'm bored from the Smartphone market since some years now. Everytime in the last 2-3 years we got just some small updates or design changes, nothing that made me say ""WOW""."
C1QC8NNODsw;the foldable phones are a interesting twist in another direction.
C1QC8NNODsw;"I hope the market wakes up und gives us new Tech that makes us say ""Wow! Nice, i want this! This is something new!"" - but at the moment... i'm bored as fuck out of the smartphone market..."
C1QC8NNODsw;You guys should look at the Samsung a80
C1QC8NNODsw;Then get a Nokia flip phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung s10+5G?
C1QC8NNODsw;Sounds like a math problem
C1QC8NNODsw;You forgot to mention the popular Galaxy A series. And M series for the midrange segment. This strategy keeps Samsung as the global market leader in smartphones
C1QC8NNODsw;Let's go retro.. dumb phones... bring back nokia and bb era, with snake and tic tac toe days.
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung Galaxy Note Ten Plus Five Gee
C1QC8NNODsw;Don’t lie who’s watching while reading comments?🤣😆😄💯✅
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm over smartphones. I'm over cars. I'm over underpants. No real innovation, so they're boring now. :-P
C1QC8NNODsw;After under display cameras become standard I think companies may start making the entire screen able to read finger prints instead of one spot after that I don’t knit what else they could do besides increasing battery life and increasing camera quality
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey Austin
C1QC8NNODsw;This is guys
C1QC8NNODsw;I am on my Oneplus 5T, i am a bit bored about it, but at the same time, there is not realy a Phone, without a stupid kind of notch, with headphone Jack, faster than mine and the ability to Change the battery for a price that i could spent. So if there is no real option on my thinking now, how possible is it, that there is one with in a year?
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhone is easy to distinguish because there are two phones in reality: iPhone and every other Android phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Gimicky cheap phones are more fun.
C1QC8NNODsw;The iPhone killed phone designs? It started a whole new market and was a milestone, you can use an iPhone or an Android instead of a laptop.
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin's too much of a geeky fanboy to ever be over smartphones. As soon as Apple releases the iPhone 11, he'll jizz his pants, just like he does every year.
C1QC8NNODsw;Why didn't you talk about the project ara
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 10 is a fraud. Note 10+ is boring.
C1QC8NNODsw;There you go.
C1QC8NNODsw;Smart phones are tools and should be used as one. The more features it has the better.
C1QC8NNODsw;i think we are so entitled nowadays..this sounds like a first world problem! it's not a problem at all... choose what you like and can afford.. and that's it! simple!
C1QC8NNODsw;So wtf is the problem with not upgradeing every year?
C1QC8NNODsw;Moore's law is dead
C1QC8NNODsw;Says smartphones are boring, yet Austin is able to afford every new phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;That's why foldable phones are so interesting. And it'll be even more interesting if we get different kinds of fding phones
C1QC8NNODsw;If I actully saw some one throwing out a Samsung s10 out I'll littlerly go threw all that trash to get the phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Who are you kidding? Have you seen the range of park ranger mobiles in unbox therapy? All shapes and forms
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm all in for folding phones but I'm gonna stick to normal slab phones until the tech for folding phones become cheaper and more reliable.
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys, i’m dead inside.
C1QC8NNODsw;The iphone made and borke the phone industry
C1QC8NNODsw;"I feel bad for the Apple keynote speakers that have to stand up there and talk for 15 minutes every year about a new ""revolution""...."
C1QC8NNODsw;I like how people lie to themselves just to stick with the note 9.
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 10 plus is better device in almost ewrithing its a evolution and the future
C1QC8NNODsw;Faster and better cameras ,display is even more crisp . Over smarthones is a statment from the rich spoiled kid with to much
C1QC8NNODsw;I told you... the only reason I upgrade my smartphone is Software, I mean better software means better security.
C1QC8NNODsw;I have Galaxy A8 2018 and even up to this day, I don't understand why I need to upgrade at least until 2020.
C1QC8NNODsw;First world problem
C1QC8NNODsw;Rocking a S7 edge right now, I won't upgrade before fall 2020 because I absolutely see no reason with my use. I might even wait till 2021.
C1QC8NNODsw;Sure a better camera would be nice but other then that, there's really nothing which I need.
C1QC8NNODsw;in februrary I bought the same phone again, a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 for 130€. I slapped LineageOS on it and there you go. I might become the first Note 3 user to reach one entire decade of daily driving the same smartphone.
C1QC8NNODsw;smartphones price are also very ridiculous nowadays
C1QC8NNODsw;Here I am still rocking my note 3 that I got when it came out x)
C1QC8NNODsw;Check this: IPhone should make a lens that you can use as a phone (with wireless earbuds) and than it would be the ultimate eyephone.
C1QC8NNODsw;"Are you guys doing it as a kind of unnamed promotion for pixel.4xl wave motion bring the word ""smartphones are almost same "" @austinevans"
C1QC8NNODsw;So right...
C1QC8NNODsw;thinks 7 is a lot doesn't even mention Samsungs mid & budget lines from which double or even triple that number.
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm not paying the money the phones are going too.  I have a family of 4, I will not spend $5000+ every two years to upgrade phones.  I have better places for money.
C1QC8NNODsw;smartphones are boring says person that tells me what makes my smartphone cool.
C1QC8NNODsw;The Note 10 really was the most disappointing smartphone in years...
C1QC8NNODsw;Vocal Fry
C1QC8NNODsw;The combination of hardware and software is going to be huge going forwards. Where a smaller upgrade in hardware can be made to a massive benefit when accompanied by really nice software features. Hardware is not as important as it once was. New sensors and processors are what’s going to count most.
C1QC8NNODsw;I honestly be okay if Apple and Samsung took two years off. We really don't need a new phone every year.
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m happy that your 1,000 dollar phone lasting 5 to 10 years!! People don’t want to upgrade every year!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Clear iPhones
C1QC8NNODsw;For those that can't afford to pay for a new phone every year, I hate that they bring out a new phone every year. Blah
C1QC8NNODsw;I think blaming Apple for coming out with a revolutionary phone.  Other should have Innovated on top of what apple did.
C1QC8NNODsw;Maybe it's a good thing, phones use valuable rare metals and producing products like this contributes to ecological damage.
C1QC8NNODsw;Maybe it's good that after three years your phone is still competitive and can keep up performance wise so you don't have to spend £100's on a new one.
C1QC8NNODsw;All the new phones need to add now is the problem with the overtime slow down of the devices
C1QC8NNODsw;The mobile world need the same as the stock market had or the real estate might get soon.
C1QC8NNODsw;And thats a crash, a mobile tech crash would help the price go down and reevaluate our need...but the most important part would be a push for compagnies to design new and different devices
C1QC8NNODsw;Bring back the Motorola  razers
C1QC8NNODsw;recently samsung has been getting rid of their headphone jack,
C1QC8NNODsw;there isn't one for the a80, but that's reasonable because of the rotating camera and that would take up a lot of space.
C1QC8NNODsw;the fold doesnt have a headphone jack but that's probably because of all the tech in there that actually makes the phone work when folding or when it is being folded
C1QC8NNODsw;This guy speaking some truth
C1QC8NNODsw;In 10 years we lost so features cause many companies have literally been idiots taking basic features a way to make us pay for them example headphonejack...Some backwards ass logic
C1QC8NNODsw;It'll be a chip in yo head real soon don't worry about it
C1QC8NNODsw;No sd card slot what the heck. I like my note 4, replaceable battery, headphone jack, and an sd card slot. Oh yeah, I also like having a bezel with a physical home button and the touch buttons that don't disappear because they are on the screen.
C1QC8NNODsw;John is lost in universe.
C1QC8NNODsw;Dude innovation takes time and patience. You can fundamentally change  how your shoes look, but you still buy it. You youtubers need to get a real job man. Ah I cant understand who thinks you are qualified enough to think we should listen to you guys. Another isheep ranting!
C1QC8NNODsw;Using the s8 for 2 years now l, don't have any reason to upgrade.
C1QC8NNODsw;I just want to say that the original Samsung note had face unlock. It wasn't very secure but it was still there
C1QC8NNODsw;I don't get how that's confusing
C1QC8NNODsw;It’s not Apple’s fault that every other weak company wanted to copy their success.
C1QC8NNODsw;The problem is that companies are coming out with phones wayyyy too fast so the innovations are small
C1QC8NNODsw;I love options so I live that Samsung has many unlike Apple.
C1QC8NNODsw; For me also design isn't a big thing that Iook for, as Samsung has been getting it right for the most part.
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 7 could have been a best phone
C1QC8NNODsw;but wish Samsung will get it back, yes
C1QC8NNODsw;They did note 7s where s was for safe
C1QC8NNODsw;But wish they get it back and making it
C1QC8NNODsw;Consumerism for the win.
C1QC8NNODsw;No headphone jack, no purchase...
C1QC8NNODsw;I almost bought a Galaxy S9. My friend said that the S8 is basically the same so now I bought a like new one on eBay (I think it was just an open unit). Now I saved $300 and can spend more on a case.
C1QC8NNODsw;I think it's kinda pointless, in my opinion.
C1QC8NNODsw;"See, there is a ""flavour"" of smartphones for everyone: there are entry-level, mid-range, upper mid-range, sort of low-end-flagships and flagships. In the past, you didn't have much choice."
C1QC8NNODsw;"Some people like plastic back covers, there are phones with this material; some people like metal, there are phones with this material; some people like glass backs, there are phones with glass backs; there are blue phones, green phones, red phones, different colour shaded phones, mat finish, gloss finish,  etc..."
C1QC8NNODsw;I just realized Samsung could have made the s pen slot the headphone jack and that would solve the whole problem
C1QC8NNODsw;thing is no, you can't even recommend a phone. nothing unique about, specs are essentially the same, all look similar, a lot of them are in the same configuration.
C1QC8NNODsw;Everyone keeps having babies. Not everyone has phone lol.  I got a Galaxy J3 Star, and I have no plans on upgrading.
C1QC8NNODsw;Ok
C1QC8NNODsw;Honestly what is the point in apple making a new phone every year? I have a Motorola Z2 Play and it's been good to me for 3 years and no cracks or anything! Also, one of my friends dad has an IPhone 6 and it does everything he needs it to! I want to see a real game changer!
C1QC8NNODsw;crosses leg to flex human races
C1QC8NNODsw;we get better Hardware like cpu ram battery tho but why we have PCs that we can game and edit on sooo why do we need a phone wit like 64gb ram 1tb storage 8 core cpu i dont see the meaning
C1QC8NNODsw;Xiaomi apple and Samsung is bad so Huawei is good
C1QC8NNODsw;Shiny
C1QC8NNODsw;i think the iphone is more slow at growing
C1QC8NNODsw;still have the same crappy camera app and the battery's are really bad for an expensive phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Smart phones are now like commodity printers. Who gets excited or reviews printers/scanners?
C1QC8NNODsw;Didn't they just prototype foldable phones
C1QC8NNODsw;We should go back to smaller phones
C1QC8NNODsw;The year is 2020, leaps and bounds will be made in the tech industry... Did you really think they would bring out anything amazing for 2019?!
C1QC8NNODsw;"We need the return of real one-handed phones. Like real ""small"" phones."
C1QC8NNODsw;I get this point of view if you're a kind of guy who upgrades every year or if you're a tech youtuber who upgrades every week, but for a lot of people an upgrade is every 2 or more years and there are pretty big leaps.
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys this is exhausting
C1QC8NNODsw;Honestly, it’s not really the design and features that are holding me back from buying a new phone, it’s the price. I don’t want to spend almost a grand for something that will be “outdated” in less than a year.
C1QC8NNODsw;Still rocking my Xperia Z3 that I got back in 2014. There's been no reason for me to upgrade, some phones even give me reasons to not upgrade, like the edge-to-edge display that I keep bumping on every phone I try with one. My Z3 still lasts a day, has all the features I need, and has NFC (which for some reason even today some mid-range devices don't have). I keep the software up to date thanks to some amazing devs over at XDA-Developers who have taken this device from Android KitKat (which it released with) to running Android 9.0 Pie. Only complaint I can have is that it's slower than newer devices, although it still keeps up with some mid-range devices, so that's even bearable. There really isn't much reason to upgrade.
C1QC8NNODsw;you could do a giveaway not throw a smartphone in trash lol
C1QC8NNODsw;So glad you guys are talking about this. I was wondering if I was the only one feeling this way. Smartphones are getting boring and I actually think that's okay.
C1QC8NNODsw;Great smartphones design was like a gold rush starting with the first iPhone. Now they're all pretty awesome. Now everyone has a smartphone. I think that's a good thing! These companies rode that wave and enjoyed mile high profits but now they'll have to figure out a new way to provide value.
C1QC8NNODsw;nice humanraces austin
C1QC8NNODsw;"I think with smart phones being so good that they last a couple years, companies need to go back to taking a year or so to bring out a phone. If they want they can keep updating their os but give the new phones more time. The galaxy fold is a great example. They are rushed and problems are great. And other companies have really bad issues with software and hardware. Google has had many issues with their pixel lineup sense it has come out.  I know that they are ""new"" to the smartphone world but they did have the nexus phones too. I'm just saying if we don't need to upgrade every year, don't give us a phone every year. Go back to every two years. Give us anticipation, give us something that feels like great leaps. Not just here you go new year somewhat new phone."
C1QC8NNODsw;I disagree, once companies have nailed foldable phones there will be plenty more designs
C1QC8NNODsw;I must say, I do like the look of the note 10, but think it would best if it had an under screen camera and definitely larger battery
C1QC8NNODsw;What's even more confusing with samsung is, that they have dual sim now and everywhere they say it's dual sim, but if you get the 5g model (which isn't cheap), you only get single sim (like in the s10). It wasn't easy to get the information at release, and it's really annoying because i wanted the note10+ 5g for work and private, for that i need dual sim.
C1QC8NNODsw;These companies with the 1000$+ phones are in for a rude awakening.
C1QC8NNODsw;I love your video but u a nerd
C1QC8NNODsw;Who else is watching on the Samsung s10 plus?
C1QC8NNODsw;Here is an idea. Under display solar panels that will charge a battery and reduce consumption.
C1QC8NNODsw;But, what if the OG iPhone (or any iPhone) never exist at all?
C1QC8NNODsw;My guess is, it will be almost the same, but the main player will be Microsoft, Samsung, Nokia and Google.
C1QC8NNODsw;"The basic technology that start this trend is ""capacitive touchscreen"", LG is using that on LG Prada (yes, it's released before OG iPhone), and of course Samsung (as their main rival) will also trying to get that tech while developing bada, and microsoft will also trying to get that (but they'll keep the stylus, and they'll continue to make PDA-style smartphone),  Nokia also do the same while trying to turn their symbian OS to touch-based OS. While smaller manufacturers will join google side to create touch-based OS."
C1QC8NNODsw;Time to kill Google and get software variation and good software into the mobile market.
C1QC8NNODsw;Totally agree. Once you have a fairly new phone (1-3 years old) theres just no need to upgrade anymore... at least for the 750-1000$ they try and get from you every year or so.
C1QC8NNODsw;They are purposely killing the smart phone market especially by releasing every year
C1QC8NNODsw;For the second time in two years, volunteers for the non-governmental organization Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) participated in the Lægedage 2018 Doctor's Fair in Denmark between November 12-16 to inform attendees about forced organ harvesting in China.
C1QC8NNODsw;The laws of evolution apply to smart phones. They have evolved to a common form because it works. If you want something different it is necessary to change the commercial environment. Selling price, battery life, and the availability of the raw materials to make them are the common drivers now.
C1QC8NNODsw;CLICK TO BUY STARTER PACK FOR FORTNITE 12:55
C1QC8NNODsw;I currently have a galaxy s8 and I've had it for coming close now to 2 years now and I just don't see the point in upgrading, I can just wait for my contract to finish in September and get a Sim only contract for a quater of the price and keep using it until it breaks alot of phones now are becoming more expensive and it just doesn't excise me compared to in the past can you remember the past iphone launches they juse to be huge but now people just aren't that enthusiastic about anything as nothings really that interesting like you said we already have everything and  we are at a point where if phone manufacturers don't find some way to creat something new alot of people just wont be buying new phones every year or 2 as they are able to keep using the phone they currently have like myself.
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones have been boring for years
C1QC8NNODsw;I think that is positiv that the smartphones not changes that much over the years because it s gonna be less “tech” you tubers 😊
C1QC8NNODsw;My first cell phone I bought was around '04/'05 was the Moto Razr. The first smartphone ever was the Moto Cliq in '10. I was into Android since then and Soo anti Apple. Well fast forward nearly 10 years and mostly all Galaxys later, I'm now on my second iPhone (Xr) after two years with the beautiful 7plus. I don't plan to upgrade anytime soon. Yes that feeling has left where a phone was interesting. Now Android phones have become too slim and tall to my taste where I used to mock the iPhone 5 for..
C1QC8NNODsw;New phones have better internal hardware. Take a phone from 2015 and a phone from 2019. It's faster processor, ram, gpu, wifi, bluetooth, 4/5G band, NFC... etc got alott better. It's not the exterior, but the interior that matters now (the spec sheet).
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey don’t make fun of the BB Passport, the shape had a real purpose and it was a beast of a communications device. Too bad it had to die
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 8 has home button ? 😅😅 but really really booring phone right now
C1QC8NNODsw;Well... I'm happy with 21:9 on my xperia 1 ☺️
C1QC8NNODsw;Damn he's wearing some damn expensive shoes, mad respect
C1QC8NNODsw;Damn all these tech youtubers showing off their sneaker game and i love it
C1QC8NNODsw;"""Hey guys! This is exhausting"""
C1QC8NNODsw;Hmmm I got Sahoo trailer instead of ad XD and it's awesome
C1QC8NNODsw;thank you Austin for finally making this video
C1QC8NNODsw;"Galaxy fold is the answer ;)"
C1QC8NNODsw;austin, you have 3 iphones, can u pls give me one i can't afford it
C1QC8NNODsw;7:43, ha ha ha
C1QC8NNODsw;The last phone I was excited about was the iPhone 7 plus. I'm rarely even watching videos any more. Somebody needs to do something radical.
C1QC8NNODsw;Heyyy guys this is smartphone!
C1QC8NNODsw;Anyone notice the Koya eye cover from BT21??
C1QC8NNODsw;Pfft I use holograms
C1QC8NNODsw;As Moore’s law starts to take shape.. Pretty soon the companies will have to do more to sell us units
C1QC8NNODsw;Enter: Austin Evans
C1QC8NNODsw;Dont throw them give 1 to me lol
C1QC8NNODsw;"I noticed this years ago. When a new phone comes out they show you the back side to show you the ""design"" of the phone. It's been years like that."
C1QC8NNODsw;5g gave smartphone manufacturers a reason to release one more variant of same phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;I think Qualcomm should release a special chip for gaming phones every year, not available to all phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;Those shoes though.
C1QC8NNODsw;7:38 thats not a phone its a bomb
C1QC8NNODsw;I used to upgrade every 2 years. But now that the prices are $1000+, I'll upgrade after 3 years.
C1QC8NNODsw;Besides, flagships easily last for 3 years nowadays
C1QC8NNODsw;I mean the last phone I wow was the mate X not Find X😂
C1QC8NNODsw;gimme yr phone austin then
C1QC8NNODsw;touch screen phone that flips to a keyboard
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones:the ultimate microtransactions
C1QC8NNODsw;I swear this is becoming a sneaker show ,lol
C1QC8NNODsw;Im still using A9 pro 2016, not gonna upgrade until 5G become common in my country
C1QC8NNODsw;S10e is still the best bet, or just get an oneplus 7 pro
C1QC8NNODsw;asus rog phone 2 is king...
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones these days are becoming Call Of Duty
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys this is exhausting
C1QC8NNODsw;If only rog2 has an ip68 rating
C1QC8NNODsw;The wow factor died years ago. I dunno how YTers keep up the fake hype.
C1QC8NNODsw;- I like galaxy fold
C1QC8NNODsw;- I want some slider or folding phone and apple killed phone industry
C1QC8NNODsw;.....
C1QC8NNODsw;Both wearing Apple Watch.
C1QC8NNODsw;Once phones are completely screen we will be flabbergasted for a while and a month or year later it’ll be a very boring design.
C1QC8NNODsw;Bigger battery plz
C1QC8NNODsw;How can you say iPhones killed phone design?  When ford designed the assembly line it revolutionized the industry.  Same as the iPhone, the design was so well designed and innovative that is changed phones forever.  I’d rather argue that other phone companies take less risky choices to appeal to the market.
C1QC8NNODsw;I really think the Note 10 should be compared to the S10, which is an even better deal than the S10+.
C1QC8NNODsw;okay unsub
C1QC8NNODsw;This was a given, do you see any changes in a TV, Microwave, Dishwasher, Washing Machine Etc etc etc....but we still use them, they are still useful to humans. So STOP sensationalizing a similar situation with Smart Phones, although I think there is still some innovation remaining to happen with them.
C1QC8NNODsw;Please You tubers come up with some useful videos which can add value to us and increase our knowledge.
C1QC8NNODsw;the FUTURE of smart phones is Holographic Displays, then as that tech develops it gets shrunk down and since you have a holo display you don't need to fit a large screen on the device and so the device can shrink down to a watch or some other form factor, but we are talking a decade or more out for that.
C1QC8NNODsw;"""HEY GUYS, EXHAUZZTING"" my god I always skip the intro I cannot watch this guy after him saying that."
C1QC8NNODsw;Ahh Samsung is trying to make a foldable phone you know ?? But doing something different will take a while to perfect it
C1QC8NNODsw;List of mostly hardware things many modern phone should add/support/improve:
C1QC8NNODsw;Water/dust resistance
C1QC8NNODsw;Scratch/pressure resistance
C1QC8NNODsw;Wait, so the entry level Galaxy Note 10 has a lower resolution screen than my coming up on 5 years old Galaxy Note 4, which is 1440p. What sort of sense does that make? Maybe you can argue better battery life, but it's a flagship dammit.
C1QC8NNODsw;Someone should make a phone like a Nintendo Switch. The phone would come with a controller dock that it would slide into and connect automatically (like Airpods or Galaxy Buds) and come with several games (plus a store you could download a lot more from) that are optimized for the controller. Maybe even have a dock like the switch that would display the game on your tv. I know they make bluetooth controllers but I mean one that's specifically optimized for that phone and the games for it.
C1QC8NNODsw;Many tech reviewers are tired of smartphones but the majority of us consumers haven't had the privilege to own multiple flagships. Many of us are still craving better battery, better cameras, better displays in a single device. Perfect the smartphone with a reasonable price, then maybe we can move on to whatever tech comes next.
C1QC8NNODsw;John looks like a legit dad with a couple kids in highschool honors.
C1QC8NNODsw;Folding phones are gonna fail due to price. The Galaxy fold was too expensive and would have died on launch due to price. The best thing for them was the issues.
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones are just status symbols for some xD. Like I have a s7 that I got last year for 150$ and it is enough a flagship from 3 years ago. It doesn't lag when in the web, I watch youtube just fine, I can play every game I download on it. Batterry life is a bit on the lowside but still okay. Fingerprint ain't 0.01 seconds fast but it still catches 90% of the time my finger and unlocks it in a second. I can understand why the high end smartphones are starting to stagnate because only tech enthusiasts or people who wanna brag buy them. Normal people just stick what works best and isn't expensive and something like an s7/s8 is perfect(the s8 more so). And if you really want a camera improvement just go buy a proffesional camera.
C1QC8NNODsw;Says a kid which doesn't know that note 8 doesn't have physical button...
C1QC8NNODsw;Watching this on iPhone 6s. The only reason why I would upgrade is for a better battery but what do you expect after a couple year plus old phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;Does the phone work if it works nobody cares it works
C1QC8NNODsw;Think about the mug you have on the table 11:56 . Same design for centuries, just another version of it. Smartphones will be as boring as choosing a new mug. A tool, a device, an everyday item. Just like the boring table you have your boring mug on. But the fact that human technology has reach that point of development in a device is what becomes really exciting, even when it means that the device becomes boring.
C1QC8NNODsw;They should release new phones every 2nd year and not with just half ass incremental upgrades. I do not get people who change their phones every 6 months or even those who manage to screw up a phone in one year.
C1QC8NNODsw;I feel the Apple design team had plenty of ideas to innovate apple products, but the executive team decided to support profits over innovation.
C1QC8NNODsw;There bts fanboys
C1QC8NNODsw;All new phones are all same, that's why I do not won't to switch from my 4s that I use as a main phone with no problems,
C1QC8NNODsw;Pros: Portability that newer phones have not, they are like tablets
C1QC8NNODsw;Cons: It is not supported since 2016, but I only use it for phone calls, so I don't care that much
C1QC8NNODsw;Honestly, I'm still rocking my Turbo 2 and I'm enjoying it. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that all these newer phones have and I perfectly fine with that. Why upgrade to something that has a pop up camera or can fold? That's not enticing for me to jump ship.
C1QC8NNODsw;I think, Samsung should just stick with launching flagships, keep selling them until they're midrange at best. I still use my Galaxy Note 3 and it works well to this day.
C1QC8NNODsw;Gaming phones have better sustained performance than their flagship counterparts thanks to better cooling or in some cases unrestricted CPU loading for extended periods of gaming loads.
C1QC8NNODsw;We don't need any more changes....
C1QC8NNODsw;send me the lg g8 thinq and ill do a blind test to yell if it was a nokia or not ...maybe
C1QC8NNODsw;Everything will get worst in future
C1QC8NNODsw;I kinda find everything boring as I grow up except for music production.
C1QC8NNODsw;Yo guys need more innovative idea which leads to increase in global warming problem..i hope humanity extincts soon..worst species in the history of planet earth..
C1QC8NNODsw;Tottally agree Still using my 4 and half year-old galaxy s6 can't  find any reason to upgrade except that it got laggy with the last update thanks samsung
C1QC8NNODsw;Came for Evans dumping an S10 into a bin. Didn't get it, but am not disappointed.
C1QC8NNODsw;TRUE
C1QC8NNODsw;My phone is an Alcatel 1. Let's take those no bezells, those dual cameras, those fingerprint scanners, those front facing flash and more and just get rid of it *all*
C1QC8NNODsw;How's that for different? 🙃
C1QC8NNODsw;I prefer the rectangle over the folding phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;If smartphones are boring - then what do you think videos about them with little new content are like ?
C1QC8NNODsw;I never write this long of a comment. But this video deserves it.
C1QC8NNODsw;Let me start of by saying a very much needed video at this point in time.
C1QC8NNODsw;Even though market is saturating, companies will keep milking money till its completely saturated. Then prices will drop suddenly and competition among mid range phones will increase drastically. And then features like additional warranty will come into picture. After that smaller players who wouldn't be able to break even will either exit the market or be acquired by bigger players. Then companies will actually start getting panic attacks and move towards totally game changing innovations. But there's still time for that wave to hit. Simple economics.
C1QC8NNODsw;Samsung is making too many phones and devaluing their product line, and Apple is doing the same with their iPads and they’re moving towards doing that to the iPhone.
C1QC8NNODsw;I AGREE 100%!!!
C1QC8NNODsw;another exploding joke, how much more degenerated can Yt ers get.
C1QC8NNODsw;In my opinion what makes smartphones boring is os choice there is only android and ios...
C1QC8NNODsw;"IM GOING TO SAY THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE  RESPONSES PLEASE.  I DISAGREE WITH THIS VIDEO WHOLEHEARTEDLY.  AND HERE ARE MANY REASONS. WHY.  FIRST.... I AM A GAMER.  CONSOLE, PC,  AND ANDROID. AND I AM ALWAYS WAITING FOR THE NEXT SNAPDRAGON SOC.  EMULATION IS THE NAME OF THE GAME AND I REALLY CANT WAIT TO BE ANLE TO PLAY GAMECUBE,  WII,  AND PS2 GAMES ON MY PHONE AT FULL SPEED IN FULL RESOLUTION. SO WITH EVERY YEAR,  CHIPSETS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL.  SURE THIS IS AN ESOTERIC STANDPOINT,  BUT A VALID ONE.  THIS REASON IS WHY I HAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE ""YOU DON'T NEED THIS MUCH STORAGE"" IN TANDEM WITH THE 100s OF GAMES YOU CAN HAVE WITH HIGHER EMULATORS THAT ARE LIKE 5 TO 6GB per game,  there is also vlogging with back cam as i frequently do ony other channel. when i finish 1 session of a vlog,  i have video with many takes thats about 2 hours long and about 250GB in size.  naturally i edit the video down to 15 or so min.  but there."
C1QC8NNODsw;there is no evolution between iphone 1 and iphone x just progress.
C1QC8NNODsw;They should make a phone that has a flashlight that changes colors
C1QC8NNODsw;Completely wrong. The perfect phone would be a Bezel-less phone with 5000mah battery, front speakers, wireless charging and real water proofing. Doesn't exist yet. At all.
C1QC8NNODsw;Those are the ugliest shoes ive seen in a while
C1QC8NNODsw;Aye greed
C1QC8NNODsw;No worries implants are on the way and You will. BE the phone. And when you get the neurological implants. You will be hooked to the hive mind in the cloud and be a Total zombie for the elite. Just ask sophia the robot who's citizen of Saudi Arabia. :)
C1QC8NNODsw;Just waiting on 5g to completely roll out. No worries. Trumps on it
C1QC8NNODsw;The biggest changes in smartphones is the OS .... The hardware doesn't express change
C1QC8NNODsw;"The thing is, should phone designs be made crazier and more ""fun"" over function just to be more interesting? I don't think so. As something gets perfected, it's going to lose personality. That's just how it is. I think folding phones are a terrible idea, though. Like why? They're big and bulky, they don't feel comfortable, they can break in so many ways, and they cost a ton of money. I don't understand why tech YouTubers are so hyped on them. Is it just because they're different? They say that's not the case in this video, but I think so. If you're big on Netflix on the go, you get a tablet. Even if you don't want a tablet, screens are much bigger on phones these days, so it shouldn't be a problem. You don't buy a super expensive folding phone just to watch Netflix on the go, though."
C1QC8NNODsw;U two r so funny have nothing better to talk about so put ur phone in the garbage then 😂😂😂
C1QC8NNODsw;Its because you don't have any slow phones. If you had a slow phone you would definitely switch.
C1QC8NNODsw;There's no notches looks at minecraft😐😐😑😑
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhones ruined everything
C1QC8NNODsw;A single glass slab
C1QC8NNODsw;'The people who own smartphones today are not gonna just hold to them for a year or two years, but they'll use them for three, four, maybe even five years'
C1QC8NNODsw;Apple: hold my beer
C1QC8NNODsw;Cant agree more
C1QC8NNODsw;Anyone watches this on an note 8 and get triggerd
C1QC8NNODsw;Also remember you play with all of the phones. Normal consumer doesn’t. You tech reviewers are basing everything off of your own lives really. Most of us aren’t as tired of these as you guys.
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones before iPhone were screen + keyboard so there was room to make interesting designs to improve the usability... Now phones are just screen, there is not much you can do to differentiate while maintaining a good experience which is basically what is shown on the screen... People also use their phones as a tool they don't care about the little features, just want to get things done without any issues
C1QC8NNODsw;Because the end goal of it the whole time was to get to a slab of glass of entire screen, every advancement worked towards that goal and we got there....and now you're just annoyed we can't change something for the sake of changing something?
C1QC8NNODsw;Booooorrrriiiiiing
C1QC8NNODsw;One materalistic boi vs poor metro pcs gangers
C1QC8NNODsw;10:21 why you watching Netflix In the gym?
C1QC8NNODsw;I pretty much stay a couple of years behind when I upgrade, the performance on the older flagships honestly aren't that bad anymore
C1QC8NNODsw;Thank you Captain Obvious!! 🦸🏻‍♂️
C1QC8NNODsw;I just found out in the future we run out of new things to add to smart phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Next big thing is AR glasses it is the future ❤
C1QC8NNODsw;Thanks for pointing out the obvious
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m actually very glad that you made this video, this is a huge discussion that should be brought to the limelight
C1QC8NNODsw;that true..i'm sick of phones each year or 2...companies always changing new phones...
C1QC8NNODsw;i agree with austin power..
C1QC8NNODsw;i'm using not 9 still loving it..no need to upgrade in another year..
C1QC8NNODsw;Gaming pc 2019???? Pleaseee
C1QC8NNODsw;I cant help but noticed the koya eye mask 💜💜💜
C1QC8NNODsw;Nice nickel, Moscow Mule mug you've got there.
C1QC8NNODsw;give me a good android based flip phone, please
C1QC8NNODsw;He didnt review the vivo nex :(
C1QC8NNODsw;we need a triangle smart phone i buy one
C1QC8NNODsw;i am gonna get a Motorola razr
C1QC8NNODsw;Oh ok give me those phones
C1QC8NNODsw;Great video Austin! 👍👍👍
C1QC8NNODsw;Absolutely well said Austin. Until the folding phones are unveiled, it's same same for us. ☺️😭😭😭
C1QC8NNODsw;Yeah I think is the same too....!!
C1QC8NNODsw;Just knew that note 8 have home button
C1QC8NNODsw;I have the Razer phone 2!!
C1QC8NNODsw;woi..... theres now the so called foldable smartphones or you can call it the real phablet, which still is a smartphone
C1QC8NNODsw;2020 will be the year of AI
C1QC8NNODsw;Cameras are still not great and we might see a big leap in the next couple of years.
C1QC8NNODsw;Wow factor has been gone and things are not as interesting anymore, technology in general.
C1QC8NNODsw;Smartphones are reaching the point where every has something really powerful and no one needs the power.  And they all look the same with varying rectangle sizes.
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin should start a phone company
C1QC8NNODsw;I'll take it if you don't want if 😅 need one
C1QC8NNODsw;We are stagnant in hardware and won’t see something new until 10+ years. The innovation and race is with software now
C1QC8NNODsw;I want this phone
C1QC8NNODsw;The note10 has video bokeh, which is completely awesome!
C1QC8NNODsw;phones are upgraded but can it survive a single drop???
C1QC8NNODsw;cool video tech talk austin about  smartphone i like cellphone with removable battery like the samsung galaxy s5 with water re-stent  which was rare at the time   to have water resetent i wish the samsung galaxy s4 had a water restiant  at the time  plus have a removeable battery
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m over smartphones.............
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m changing to dumb phones
C1QC8NNODsw;We will be OUR phones today comrades
C1QC8NNODsw;If austin throws all those phone
C1QC8NNODsw;someone make a pearphone
C1QC8NNODsw;Cellphones need to get into a cylindrical form so we can shove them up the arsh and soon they’ll  start making them with special features
C1QC8NNODsw;Ever ironed a shirt before?
C1QC8NNODsw;I agree, but I have to say that Pixel 4 with soli radar might be the only thing worth talking about.
C1QC8NNODsw;**clickbait**
C1QC8NNODsw;To be honest i dont even bother buying a brand new phone im okay with what i got my samsung galaxy A7 2018 it has almost all the features i need for every day life
C1QC8NNODsw;You forgot to mention the Galaxy Fold, another flagship
C1QC8NNODsw;Considering I never had my own personal phone for a solid 17 years, and I still don't. I enjoy my bezels on my tablet, the thick feel allowing me to have an easier grip. But the Note 7 Pro is impressive to me. Something I want to save up for. Also, by 17years, I mean my 17 years on this planet, I have never owned a phone
C1QC8NNODsw;He is wearing a koya eye mask ... So Austin is a bt21 fan I guess...
C1QC8NNODsw;Design is a big part of what makes a smartphone so interesting. Their is only so a few years for this rectangular form factor. As soon as next year we will finally see smartphones have a full screen form with sensors under the display. Smartphones will be interesting again with foldable technology.
C1QC8NNODsw;Is this another clickbait title I see🤔🤔
C1QC8NNODsw;I used to have the urge to buy a really expensive phone, but when I thought about it, all I do is browse social media and watch videos. I ditched it and bought a gaming PC instead. Money well spent. (though if I am rich I would have bought the expensive phone and a gaming pc lol)
C1QC8NNODsw;If BlackBerry makes their phones more robust and with better specs, I think they could do well
C1QC8NNODsw;phones here in the philippines is expensive now very
C1QC8NNODsw;Guys hey Austin this is!
C1QC8NNODsw;We have reached the highest summit of the phone industry and it seems the only way to leave it is by going down.
C1QC8NNODsw;Yeah but Do I care
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones became boring around the time when the iphone 6 and the S4 came out.
C1QC8NNODsw;I think it's more of an issue with you guys, tech youtubers than regular consumers. While you guys have to review and test each iteration of every major flagship out there, we can pick and choose which model we want and when we upgrade. 90% of consumers don't upgrade every year. Jumping from a 2012 phone to a 2019 phone still has an amazing wow factor!
C1QC8NNODsw;This is the very definition of a first world problem
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys this is clickbait!
C1QC8NNODsw;The razer phone is 400$ right now (actually 350 on best buy ) so I think its worth for those speakers (I dont bring headphones so speakers are very important)
C1QC8NNODsw;God, what are those shoes
C1QC8NNODsw;im tired of phones as well i hate how samsung killed the headphone jack and got rid of the sd card as well and that was the thing that killed my interest
C1QC8NNODsw;What is the next Phone?
C1QC8NNODsw;Charge almost the same price but offer less features every year. Capitalism as its best
C1QC8NNODsw;Note 10e
C1QC8NNODsw;Totally agree with the last no-upgrading part. I have a Samsung galaxy s9 and I don't plan on upgrading for years, I have everything I want from this form of a phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;Why do no gaming phones have shoulder buttons?
C1QC8NNODsw;I agree for most the things you said about smartphone revolutionary. But when you said iPhone make big revolution since their starting model, i start to think... WTH?!!
C1QC8NNODsw;"No. You are not over smartphones; you are over Apple not making visually pleasing phones."
C1QC8NNODsw;Can u give me ur phone because u hate it now
C1QC8NNODsw;Idk
C1QC8NNODsw;It's a small thing but the pixel at least had the 2 tone finish on the back, and from what we're seeing that's going away on the pixel 4.
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking phones aren't that different anymore nowadays and that there isn't really that much new stuff to be added
C1QC8NNODsw;Because you're bored? How about because all your data is being logged and then sold and essentially being a proxy for surveillance.
C1QC8NNODsw;The truth is companies focusing on releasing new phones for compitition instead of focusing on the user experience which is the most important thing.
C1QC8NNODsw;i mean the user experience after getting the phone bc what we see this time the companies. onec you get the phone they start preparing for your next upgrade phone so it's absolutely a circle buy a phone use it then upgrade it haha
C1QC8NNODsw;There’s not going to be a lot of innovation until they do something crazy like implant the smartphone into your brain
C1QC8NNODsw;You cant polish a turd but you can roll it in glitter
C1QC8NNODsw;People would be upgrading more often if these phones didn't cost $1,000.
C1QC8NNODsw;This is why I'm a big fan of the BlackBerry key2. The keyboard is such a joy to type on after years of glass. Also it's a bit quirky and interesting vs rectangles
C1QC8NNODsw;Buy an Nokia Phone.
C1QC8NNODsw;We have yet to even see a fraction of the potential technology out there. There have been batteries design to last years on a single charge, batteries that completely charge from dead in seconds, screens that are completely see through and can bend and roll, cameras that have true zooming without multiple separate lenses on the back, AI/assistance technology that can make a device usable with voice or without touching the phone in many ways, truly waterproof phones, modular devices that can adapt for different uses or grow and be upgraded as parts improve just as one might do with a PC, and so much more.
C1QC8NNODsw;I get it to a small point.. But remember it's not a super mega extreme intelligent universecis device that can do everything. It has the great features already, it's not like an pc that you can put in new parts of ur needs when the old is getting bad. This is still A Phone. A phone was made to do phone calls. As we've come this far is amazing.
C1QC8NNODsw;"Well Huawei was a player to innovate the smartphone industry with its one of a kind foldable phone alongside Samsung. Unfortunately the US has since banned it... so it seems to me that Americans are happy to stick to whatever Apple dictates as ""innovation""."
C1QC8NNODsw;Even looking at Apple? This is not a samsung bash video but let me only bash Samsung. Smh
C1QC8NNODsw;Modular phones were innovative but died off.
C1QC8NNODsw;Hey guys this is Austin, at $3499 is the iPhone 13 Excess Max bullshit worth it? Short answer, Yes
C1QC8NNODsw;I would honestly happily change phones if someone made one that has modern features but has a super unique form factor similar to flip phones beck in the early 2000s. Phones now are so boring and uninteresting that, if it wasn't for all the social media and 4g, I would just downgrade back to a Razr
C1QC8NNODsw;Eh probably wouldn't say this if it was an iPhone release.
C1QC8NNODsw;Galaxy s10 is last cool phone
C1QC8NNODsw;Honestly.... you’re right.... like I have to agree smartphones are boring and as a person who sells them and interacts daily it’s nothing crazy.
C1QC8NNODsw;hey guys this is ostrich!
C1QC8NNODsw;I agree
C1QC8NNODsw;You know the funny part? People don't even realize they're overpaying for these 'flagship' phones.
C1QC8NNODsw;I mean, what is a 'flagship'? Well people have interpreted that to mean:
C1QC8NNODsw;-latest SD
C1QC8NNODsw;-6GB RAM
C1QC8NNODsw;I feel like folding phones with maybe some sort of under screen keyboard tech (not even sure if its possible but I would love to see it or something similar, just SOME way to give tactile keyboards! Its the only reason I never got attached to touchscreen phones, because besides reading or listening to music or watching videos, I can't type for shit on it at all in comparison to my fast desktop PC typing and I do a lot of typing)
C1QC8NNODsw;This is why I am just sticking with my iPhone for now and just wait for apple to make something different or better than my iPhone X.  When they do make the best phone, then here it comes Samsung for the attack, then Apple retaliates with something better... and on and on and on... boring....
C1QC8NNODsw;Phones will eventually be holographic screens that are inserted to ones arm with a mic that you basically put your wrist up to your mouth to have a call.
C1QC8NNODsw;Or you just do what apple does and put shitty batteries in their phones so people upgrade faster.
C1QC8NNODsw;iPhone X, XS, XS Max, XR makes no sense what so ever and Samsung is on the same trend
C1QC8NNODsw;Really? Too much whining over nothing - that's my opinion. 😒 smh
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin will take over the world with a full on army of mums who hate technology
C1QC8NNODsw;The LG G Flex was not only a very unique phone but it also had a lot of practical features that I really loved, it's my favorite smartphone of all time honestly and I really hope LG starts making quirky phones like they used to in the past.
C1QC8NNODsw;The biggest issue is yearly releases and the artificial need to upgrade every-single-year.  I absolutely hate it. There' no reason for there to be 3 versions of the same phone released every damn year. It's such a waste of natural resources.  I would prefer it to go back to a two year cycle or something.  Give us some better software and make updates matter like they used to.
C1QC8NNODsw;I can't decide which should I buy iPhone xs max or Samsung Galaxy note 10 plus please let me know
C1QC8NNODsw;What's next is price, and especially in the US, there's a long way to go. Look at what you can buy new for $100 - Nearly nothing. $200 can get you some okay but $100 is basically out of the question. Realme has phones that come really close but they don't have any US lte bands. Honor was starting to put some heat on Moto but then Huawei got kicked out, leaving the budget and entry levels basically solely for Moto. Now moto no longer needs to push its prices down to competitive levels because there's no/very little competition.
C1QC8NNODsw;Is Austin worth in 2019???🤔🤔🤔🤔
C1QC8NNODsw;I'm still using my s8+  its perfect for everything I could ever need
C1QC8NNODsw;Damn bruh when can we improve battery life
C1QC8NNODsw;0:55 omg those yellow human races are fire 😍
C1QC8NNODsw;Until they start making oval or diamond shape movies or YouTube videos, I’m sticking with my “rectangle” box called smartphone.
C1QC8NNODsw;Austin do a reaction to the rog phone 2
C1QC8NNODsw;Where can folding phones go?
C1QC8NNODsw;Go google the Sci-Fi show Earth: Final Conflict.
C1QC8NNODsw;Just give me those!
C1QC8NNODsw;I have a basic cellphone that make and receive calls. I am happy with that as I prefer to use a DSLR for taking photos.
C1QC8NNODsw;Did you really have to fall into the Clickbait titles and thumbnails thing :( I really used to love your content, now I just scroll past
C1QC8NNODsw;I think that smartphones may be able to do more once 5G becomes mainstream...
C1QC8NNODsw;Next level : phones using recycled materials.
C1QC8NNODsw;Yup I'd like phone manufacturer's to give us a new phone every 2 years instead of every year..
C1QC8NNODsw;Great vid Austin! So very true. Folding phones show only a big difference in foreseeable future. But time will tell how those go.
C1QC8NNODsw;Wow this was such a well done video
C1QC8NNODsw;That was a nice long form video
C1QC8NNODsw;"He is correct. I finally ditched the 2 year contract and bought my own phone out right and got on a monthly plan so I can upgrade whenever and not expect to buy a new phone with lackluster ""discounts"" after my 2 year contract was up."
C1QC8NNODsw;ROG phone ftw.
C1QC8NNODsw;We have reached a turning point where removing features from phones is innovative
C1QC8NNODsw;Zenfone 6!
C1QC8NNODsw;Who else is tired from hearing 5G
C1QC8NNODsw;Do you know what happened to techsmartt
C1QC8NNODsw;Waiting for Surface Andromeda. Very much hoping it's a phone that unfolds into a Tablet and docks like a Surface Pro
C1QC8NNODsw;i want a phone that can:
C1QC8NNODsw;- teleport me anywhere i want.
C1QC8NNODsw;- upload my brain into minecraft.
C1QC8NNODsw;- play my ps4 or pc games natively. (no remote play)
C1QC8NNODsw;This channel has made a meme
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m with you. The smart phones are not that exciting anymore
C1QC8NNODsw;innovation by iteration
C1QC8NNODsw;innovation by iteration
C1QC8NNODsw;I think we just jump to super A.R phone like in the anime Accel World
C1QC8NNODsw;Give em to me
C1QC8NNODsw;Everything is amazing. No one is happy.
C1QC8NNODsw;AUSTIN
C1QC8NNODsw;YOU
C1QC8NNODsw;W O T M 8 ?
C1QC8NNODsw;I still like the iPhone 8
C1QC8NNODsw;why did this vid seem so depressing
C1QC8NNODsw;I’m keeping my xs max not getting the 11.
C1QC8NNODsw;What do we want a circle phone?

yn_MPRHSQo8;Would you take advice from someone who can't even pronounce Xiaomi?
yn_MPRHSQo8;How does Google Pixel 3a qualify as a budget smartphone?   It's £300+.   Two or three times the price of the others!

L_Shqjv7t2c;Clarifications:
L_Shqjv7t2c;1. Correction for price of Pocophone F1 - £259, not £29 - Rendering glitch in Final Cut 😅
L_Shqjv7t2c;"2. The European Equivalent for the Redmi K20 Pro would be the ""Mi9T Pro"", but this phone did not end up getting announced at their event. Turns out your best bet may be to import the Redmi K20 Pro if you want the best spec"
L_Shqjv7t2c;Nothing beats a $999 Apple Pro Stand 🔥
L_Shqjv7t2c;“If your budget can stretch, there are 4 smartphones that I would recommend”
L_Shqjv7t2c;So basically, there’s almost no reason why one should spend a thousand dollars for a phone
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:38: the car is going backwards. 😂😂
L_Shqjv7t2c;Title : phones under $500
L_Shqjv7t2c;Reality :
L_Shqjv7t2c;One Plus 7 - $539
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:38 Apparently, with the Samsung A70 you can even reverse time ...
L_Shqjv7t2c;One of the reasons why I watch your videos is because of your voice. So relaxing 🥰
L_Shqjv7t2c;By the end of the list I felt like I was John Wick meeting up with my weapon and suit dealer before I was about to go on a mission lol
L_Shqjv7t2c;That F1 phone is a bargain at only £29 as shown at 2:50
L_Shqjv7t2c;Tim Apple: Did someone say best phone?
L_Shqjv7t2c;How about iPho... Oh wait...
L_Shqjv7t2c;Do a under 300 video
L_Shqjv7t2c;Some of us can't spend more then that for 2019
L_Shqjv7t2c;Arun, in my opinion this is one of the best videos that you’ve made. Quickly saying the highlights of each phone while comparing it to others in a very comprehensive list is amazing for the consumer. Hopefully you keep growing as a YouTuber as well as a person.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Me: *looks at 10S Plus and sees price*
L_Shqjv7t2c;Wallet: OH HELL NO
L_Shqjv7t2c;And that's why you don't buy Iphones, kids
L_Shqjv7t2c;Youtube : This video is less than 10 min long
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mrwhosettheboss : Hold my beer
L_Shqjv7t2c;7:08 wow, that looks really nice, like you recording a movie
L_Shqjv7t2c;"""Where is that one"" HAHA ❤"
L_Shqjv7t2c;"OnePlus ""Flagship killer"""
L_Shqjv7t2c;"Redmi ""Flagship nightmare"""
L_Shqjv7t2c;Wow the pocophone dropped pretty quickly at £29. That's a steal
L_Shqjv7t2c;Edit: No it was an error damn I was about to buy 10 even though I'm using one 😂
L_Shqjv7t2c;Make a 2020 version of this! I'd love to see how great mid-priced phones are after a year.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Dude u just earned a sub and notifications on
L_Shqjv7t2c;And be proud of urself(not bcz i subbed u😅😅) but bcz ur just amazing
L_Shqjv7t2c;Wait, there are fifteen 2019 smartphones under $500?
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:40 is that car going in reverse or are my eyes broken??
L_Shqjv7t2c;She’s not driving backwards, the whole thing is just shown in reverse
L_Shqjv7t2c;Probably the best tech video I've seen this year, awesome content
L_Shqjv7t2c;His voice helps me fall asleep. Soothing as hell.
L_Shqjv7t2c;So why shouldn‘t I skip to the first one and just by it, as it‘s the best?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Meizu is dying, don't buy their phones!
L_Shqjv7t2c;I rather pay more for the new Asus Rog Phone instead of the Asus Zenfone 6
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:46 29£ sounds like a good price 😄
L_Shqjv7t2c;personally, the worst thing about the honor 20's side fingerprint scanner is the fact that it's optimised for right-handed people
L_Shqjv7t2c;Question
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why is the red magic 3 phone not higher than 5? Specifically, Why is the redmi k20 pro, one plus 7, MI 9, higher?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Redmi K20 Pro. You need nothing more than this monster.
L_Shqjv7t2c;When you are here in 2020 and there is still no big clarity on huawei
L_Shqjv7t2c;top quality video, presentation, information. Just superb
L_Shqjv7t2c;I love that this guy covers some underrated phones and not only the main flagships.
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:38 HAAH it's rewind time baby
L_Shqjv7t2c;11PM Aug 16 2019~
L_Shqjv7t2c;I bought the OnePlus 5T for 325 euro back when the OnePlus 6 came out. Best buy ever
L_Shqjv7t2c;Top 15 smartphones of... nevermind, here are all the phones released in the last year.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I recommend them all!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Did someone notice that the woman, who played real racing on a70, drove reverse
L_Shqjv7t2c;I bought an lg v40 for 250$us and the price keeps going down. My 2 cents
L_Shqjv7t2c;The Mi 9 is 385$ on Aliexpress, where Xiaomi officially sells their phones, and its the global version.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Makes video about phones under 500 but includes the OnePlus 7 that's over 500...
L_Shqjv7t2c;This video is amazing ❤️❤️😌
L_Shqjv7t2c;I really enjoyed it
L_Shqjv7t2c;Never click this quickly

L_Shqjv7t2c;.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Pixel 3a XL has still the best camera ever in a smartphone...
L_Shqjv7t2c;Apple leave the group!!!!

L_Shqjv7t2c;In my country
L_Shqjv7t2c;And I probably can't use half of these because I'm with Verizon
L_Shqjv7t2c;To be fair the best value for money is LG G7 thinq

L_Shqjv7t2c;How about the Oppo F11 Pro?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Bro, your videos might be good but due to your accent your videos are not much anjoyble and satisfactory.
L_Shqjv7t2c;You recommended the Moto G7 which runs on Snapdragon 632 and you didn't mention the Redmi Note 7 which uses the Snapdragon 660 and is even cheaper and has better design than the moto G7, are you serious????
L_Shqjv7t2c;You missed Realme X .

L_Shqjv7t2c;Readmi K20 Pro: I am you, but better.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Yup,I agree the S10 5g is the best phone right now...
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mi 9 has 20 fast wireless charging apparently
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why does the zenfone have no set price? People say it costs $500 or $580 for the same exact model from tech sites to tech YouTubers 6:40
L_Shqjv7t2c;"Love your vids, but your channel name is wrong haha. It should be ""who's"" not ""whose""."
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where  Xiaomi redmi note 8 pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;Can you do a top 10 best compact phones? I feel like smartphone manufacturers are letting people with small hands down for the last few years (except sony, I have xz2 compact but the camera experience is not good, good camera but bad software)

L_Shqjv7t2c;"(Under $500) - ""if money is no object"""

L_Shqjv7t2c;Nice video but doesn't look like it's ur real voice
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about the Vivo z1 pro / z5x ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;That's some cheap £29 Poco phone f1
L_Shqjv7t2c;Dude, I honestly think You are the next Morgan Freeman! Great Awesome voice
L_Shqjv7t2c;I am watching this video on my Samsung galaxy A50
L_Shqjv7t2c;I don't find it useful, you talked about almost all the phones available on market

Def an Droid guy now but still love n respect my iPhone x for all the subtle details that other phones miss and just that ios is optimized to a T. ...so no I have Moto G7. Didn't know at time but I picked a very good phone for the money ..I sti have my iPhone and I've added note ten plus as of yesterday lol I can't stop my self Arron ...that got me thinking ... How I use to have HTC Evo then Evo 3d before I iPhone and before that I had this sliding keyboard sprint model and j and the very first Android phone and our minds we're blown when I could pull up street view and see my house lolol
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:50 ,  £29
L_Shqjv7t2c;Awesome I am New
L_Shqjv7t2c;From Pakistan
L_Shqjv7t2c;I still can't decide between Mi 9T pro and S10e
L_Shqjv7t2c;Any suggestions are welcome 🙂
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about oppo
L_Shqjv7t2c;Wolcum.
L_Shqjv7t2c;the lenovo z5s is a really nice smartphone for 150€ you get a snapdragon 710 , 6 gb ram , 128 gb storage , a noice screen , great triple cameras.
L_Shqjv7t2c;qhould put the links of the phones in the description
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mi9t pro is $326 on gears best with coupon
L_Shqjv7t2c;oof
L_Shqjv7t2c;For me the perfect phone for the $500 price range is the samsung note 9.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Here you can get a brand new 512 gb note 9 for 450$ so I'mma get that
L_Shqjv7t2c;Note 9 is best ..under budget you experience flagship Performance
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about s10e?
L_Shqjv7t2c;no google pixel 3a?
L_Shqjv7t2c;K20 pro is the best 😉
L_Shqjv7t2c;I don't think that 500$ is on a budget
L_Shqjv7t2c;Pixel 3a XL
L_Shqjv7t2c;My choices will be
L_Shqjv7t2c;Samsung S10
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mi9T
L_Shqjv7t2c;One plus 6T
L_Shqjv7t2c;wulcem

L_Shqjv7t2c;Mrwhosetheboss
L_Shqjv7t2c;I've always liked this channel, but I find it hard to spend more than USD200 on a decent phone. Perhaps USD300 max. 1 standard requirement is 4000mah battery. :)
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about asus rog 2 ,it is best phone under 38k
L_Shqjv7t2c;I found mi 9 for 330 euros
L_Shqjv7t2c;Which phone is the one at the top of the thumbnail , the one with the punch hole camera
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where's the honor 8x? It's under 200$ and has great build quality,specs ,cameras

L_Shqjv7t2c;Zenfone 6............
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about samsung galaxy s10e? You can get it for 500 and under now
L_Shqjv7t2c;samsung a80 unboxing please
L_Shqjv7t2c;Attention!!! ios users most android phones on the market including new ones are on the range of 169$-399$ and apple sells wery old phones for that prize tag
L_Shqjv7t2c;Would you recommend/put the one plus 6t in this list if it were available for around 358 USD ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;I'm thinking of whether or not to buy it given that the k20 and others are around the corner
L_Shqjv7t2c;my budget doesnt stretch to far but the s9 lookin nice
L_Shqjv7t2c;The Asus zenphone is over 500 dollars on gearbest and bangood as well as the k20 pro so idk what you talking about
L_Shqjv7t2c;How about the galaxy note 9?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Says if the budget can stretch then doubles the amount of money
L_Shqjv7t2c;Redmi note 7? It cost 150$
L_Shqjv7t2c;S9+ for £499?? Whereeeeeee?? I bought my S9 for £619 in argos 😱🔫
L_Shqjv7t2c;why i think the the 3a xl is just super
L_Shqjv7t2c;Zenfone 6 deserves No.1.
L_Shqjv7t2c;"Also OnePlus  7 Pro a ""No Compromise Phone""? Hell no....Reasons-"
L_Shqjv7t2c;I have the mi 9t
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is x2 pro?
L_Shqjv7t2c;PLEASE GIVE THE WALLPAPER APP NAME ON ONE PLUS SCREEN,,,, VERY NICE
L_Shqjv7t2c;Idk why but I feel like only flagships can look good.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Whst about oppo reno 10 x
L_Shqjv7t2c;Like for a70
L_Shqjv7t2c;Name of the car racing game?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Zenfone 5Z, its around $330 in my country.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Some of the phone in the end is over $500 😐
L_Shqjv7t2c;Dude you should check out Realme phones as well... They are really good and come under the 500$ bracket
L_Shqjv7t2c;Thought the Note 9 would feature in the $500 bracket
L_Shqjv7t2c;Is the zenfone 6 available world wide?
L_Shqjv7t2c;What happens to Lg
L_Shqjv7t2c;Note 9 the best 👌👌👌👌
L_Shqjv7t2c;samung a70 phone i want a phone that can take a great photo because pictures are worth 1000 words,  last long and won't fail on me when i use a simple app like uber or internet
L_Shqjv7t2c;And im just using the LG Stylo 4
L_Shqjv7t2c;05:44:00 AM
L_Shqjv7t2c;It's actually the OnePlus 6T, the 7 has an all screen display and 6T has the raindrod
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why is the Realme x2 Pro not in there? I mean its Powerful
L_Shqjv7t2c;K20 pro anyday
L_Shqjv7t2c;If the redmi k20 pro gets a global version (not mi9t) it will easily become the best phone for the value
L_Shqjv7t2c;Almost buy G7 ThinQ, but 3000mAh powerpack really puts me off.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Are all these phones enormous or do you have small hands?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Bruh the Pixel 3a is a phone for everyone. It can literally do any task perfectly fine and the software is so well optimized, plus they're always on sale for like $250 USD
L_Shqjv7t2c;I like the way you talk.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I was expecting the black shark 2 pro here
L_Shqjv7t2c;Got a Razer phone 2 for $325 shipped, on eBay
L_Shqjv7t2c;I was waiting for k20 pro.. that when will you mention it.. and if you hadnt mentioned it id have definitly complained to you about it.. thanks to you bcz  at last it came out on top..
L_Shqjv7t2c;Thank you for amazing video! This is what I need
L_Shqjv7t2c;what about the samsung galaxy note 9?
L_Shqjv7t2c;What should I choose? S9 plus or a70?
L_Shqjv7t2c;1+7 pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;why does normal version of k20 cost more in europe than pro version in asia?
L_Shqjv7t2c;I got an lg v30 for $200 but it still has a snapdragon 835 and 4 gigs of ram and all the features of a flagship
L_Shqjv7t2c;The pocophone is quite cheap in the uk at 29 quid. Quite cheap i have to say
L_Shqjv7t2c;ASUS ZENFONE 6 AND XIAOMI MI 9 IS THE BEST
L_Shqjv7t2c;my phone has a snapdragon 425. rip
L_Shqjv7t2c;oppo reno 10 x best
L_Shqjv7t2c;No s10e ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Anyone know where to get the Pocophone F1 for the best price?
L_Shqjv7t2c;What do u think of Oppo Reno z
L_Shqjv7t2c;What do you think about the Motorola z4
L_Shqjv7t2c;Your voice is osum
L_Shqjv7t2c;Are you sure poco phone 299£/29£
L_Shqjv7t2c;🔥
L_Shqjv7t2c; 1:56 🖤🔥
L_Shqjv7t2c;  👇👇👇🖤
L_Shqjv7t2c;no lenovo z6 pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;Riff off mkbhd
L_Shqjv7t2c;I prefer to iPhone XS and Samsung galaxy S10e as mid range phone😂😂😂
L_Shqjv7t2c;i wonder why u din pick oppo Reno 10X ...
L_Shqjv7t2c;I have a s7
L_Shqjv7t2c;Today was my first day back on the job (i deliver food in Amsterdam) and my Samsung S8 fell out of my hand while biking and it broke completely :(
L_Shqjv7t2c;the worst is that i cancelled my insurance a month ago because i thought i didn't need it anymore...... how unlucky can a guy be. Anyway, what are some good new phones that are as good as the s8 (or better) and cheaper then the s8?
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about OPPO RENO 10x Zoom?
L_Shqjv7t2c;when is k20 pro coming out in EU?
L_Shqjv7t2c;"The S10 in my country is $650 now and is a better deal than the OnePlus 7 Pro since it has wireless charging, better camera, better battery and IP rating nonetheless you're getting a ""true"" flagship phone"
L_Shqjv7t2c;What is the best webpage to compare a lot of phones with sorting and filtering option of many specs?
L_Shqjv7t2c;You ever consider giving away unlocked phones to fans of the channel? I think it would be a cool system to have older model phones get given away as more new phones come into ownership
L_Shqjv7t2c;This is coming from a 4inch calculator slab tracpgone user
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is samsung glaxy s10 ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;so basically, all the phones then
L_Shqjv7t2c;Can you suggest the best budget camera phone under $100 can be new or used.Thanks Boss
L_Shqjv7t2c;This dude literally sounds like the queen, cause he thinks he’s gonna get done by brexit
L_Shqjv7t2c;I think the best is the Nubia Red magic 3 its even way cheaper in asia with all the high end specs hardware and software. (y).
L_Shqjv7t2c;Me ...still iam using samsung star pro ....legend.....
L_Shqjv7t2c;I feel so sad about lg
L_Shqjv7t2c;They have the very first phone to have 18:9 display its the lg g6 and now they seems fell from very known to underrated smartphone brand i wish they'll make a comeback in near future
L_Shqjv7t2c;U can get 1phone six for 200 dollars
L_Shqjv7t2c;Which one would you suggest? OnePlus 6t or samsung s9+
L_Shqjv7t2c;Oneplus 7 is $539. You kinda lied
L_Shqjv7t2c;wonder how much they had to pay him for adding the xs max
L_Shqjv7t2c;A used iPhone 8 for 390 dollar
L_Shqjv7t2c;Ah yes v15 is 15th
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is the K20 Pro for £369? The cheapest one I could find with snapdragon 855 was £413???
L_Shqjv7t2c;The redmi k20 pro is just 350$  and not 400$ like u mentioned
L_Shqjv7t2c;Kindly review mobiles by telling SAR Value.,bcoz health is wealth!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mate 20 pro used right now can be had around £320ish on eBay
L_Shqjv7t2c;in here mi 9 is cheaper than $550 K20 pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;what about xioami mi 9 se!!!!?????????????
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is oppo f 11
L_Shqjv7t2c;But you do see the Xiaomi Mi 9 is going around now for almost a month for 370-400 US dollars!
L_Shqjv7t2c;It has HDR10 DCI-P3 gorilla glass 6 display over the K20 pro as well as 20 watt wireless charging, IR blaster, better overall design, aluminum frame not plastic which is a no no for AMOLED display!
L_Shqjv7t2c;The Mi 9 gets priority over the K20 pro, as well as Macro and Moon modes plus 20x zoom in moon mode.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Who is watching this on an A50
L_Shqjv7t2c;great work but please keep in mind burn in, i had note series from 1 to 8, since note 5 i had burn in issues and I suggest not buying anymore oled or amoled displays. zenphone ips top seller! i hope the industy keeps in mind these issues. I always had note series but spending more than 1000 usd for a smartphone that becomes irritating after 6 months no thanks! Please let the industry know that the best display if it lasts 6 months, not by another better one but for build issues,  it is lame.
L_Shqjv7t2c;No regrets buying the K 20 pro. Love it to the max!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mine is 258$ :D it's a Huawei Y9 Prime 2019
L_Shqjv7t2c;Watching this on my Samsung Galaxy S9 and I still want to upgrade my phone.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Google pixel 3
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:50 299$ = 29 £ LOL!!!!!
L_Shqjv7t2c;I got a lg g7
L_Shqjv7t2c;You said under 500$
L_Shqjv7t2c;"Mi 9 is £320 on AliExpress just wish it had a 7.2"" screen! 😭"
L_Shqjv7t2c;"Hope Xiaomi brings out a 7.2"" flagship this year! 🤞😁🤞"
L_Shqjv7t2c;What's the cheapest best camera phone brand
L_Shqjv7t2c;Hello Mrwhosetheboss. can you please make an updated video of the top smartphones of 2019 under $500 and their current price? Secondly, would be nice to have a top 10 or 15 video smartphones for ladies.
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about s10e arun
L_Shqjv7t2c;Another great vid Arun, thank you. My favourite has to be the Pixel 3a XL over all, for many reasons. You'll know why, in one of my videos coming soon. Oh and do look out for my next vid -
L_Shqjv7t2c;Top .........  smartphones of 2019 - coming right up.. 🤞
L_Shqjv7t2c;where can I buy k20 pro usa?
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:48 $299 / £29
L_Shqjv7t2c;Anyone else has Samsung a70?
L_Shqjv7t2c;He called the one plus 6t a one plus 7
L_Shqjv7t2c;I don't recommend any smartphone with super AMOLED screens as they burn (ghost image) after a while 🤷‍♂️
L_Shqjv7t2c;Redmi note 7
L_Shqjv7t2c;I wish note 9 was below 500€
L_Shqjv7t2c;2.40 the car is going backwards
L_Shqjv7t2c;i wish i could have 1 of those phone T_T.  mobile phones here in Philippines like those are too expensive. T_T
L_Shqjv7t2c;Please ad a sony smartphone on one of these lists for once
L_Shqjv7t2c;They deserve attention
L_Shqjv7t2c;Honor play
L_Shqjv7t2c;My choice definitely is the asus zenfone 6. 5.000mAh battery, snapdragon 855, good display, dual sim + micro sd and then this incredible camera for only 499€?!
L_Shqjv7t2c;I just bought Huawei!
L_Shqjv7t2c;#TeamHuawei
L_Shqjv7t2c;EDIT: Just bought P30 Pro yesterday!! 18 June :)
L_Shqjv7t2c;I like the Samsung A50. Camera could be a bet better, auto focus is slow and fidgety.. but overall besides that's the phone is amazing. It is made of plastic, but put a case on it and it is fine.
L_Shqjv7t2c;8/10 would recommend. (In Canada)
L_Shqjv7t2c;My main complaint is ipjones triple camera design for the iPhone 11
L_Shqjv7t2c;Xiomi note 7 pro enter the chat
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is xperia 1? 🤔
L_Shqjv7t2c;Does redmi k20 pro have 60hz screen?
L_Shqjv7t2c;And should i buy red magic 3 or k20?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Watching this on my new K20 Pro which came for less than $300 after an exchange offer! 👌🏻
L_Shqjv7t2c;Poco F1 is 29 in UK !!!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Please Donate that to me!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Can you make a video for best phones that are the same size or smaller than an iPhone XR? I don't want to carry around a massive phone.
L_Shqjv7t2c;You could've included rog2🙄
L_Shqjv7t2c;I got a mi9 se for £235 and couldn't be happier
L_Shqjv7t2c;The best place for camera lenses on a phone, is at either end of the phone  apart like our eyes.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I’d still buy an old thicc bezel iphone over these things
L_Shqjv7t2c;i agree, nothing can beat the K20 in price to performance ratio. No phone comes close.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Your voice seems so much fake...
L_Shqjv7t2c;what is your opinion on any current sony mobile phones?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why does the title imply that they are under 500?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Please tell me, how can the pocophine f1 be 30 euro's?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Oppo f11 pro is the best
L_Shqjv7t2c;I found mi 9 for 350$
L_Shqjv7t2c;Even atlast realme 3 pro or x doesn't takes place
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why Mi 9 instead of Mi9 Explorer? The Explorer packs 12 GB ram and it's still under 500... we're talking about 12 GB ram, at under 500!!!!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where's Oppo Reno 10x Zoom?? All I can see a lot of reviewers from Asia really do appreciate that model. Is it because Reno didnt cover a lot of regions that made these famous reviewers didnt include it?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where did you get this t-shirt???? Have been looking all around for it.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Honor play
L_Shqjv7t2c;Huawei P30 pro is useless to buy
L_Shqjv7t2c;My god i hope Xiaomi doesn't get banned next.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Samsung a70 or xiaomi f1 is better in battery and camera?
L_Shqjv7t2c;I bought the P30 lite 2 weeks ago and it's been great so far! Camera is okay but nothing to brag about at all! Especially since I'm switched from a pixel 3 (waiting on it to get repaired)! In terms of comparing it to the pixel the only thing that feels different is the camera
L_Shqjv7t2c;I used to have a s7 edge but switched to an iphone XR however i now want to go back to android, which one of these phones do you reckon i should go for?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Under $500 is the title, 5:55 doesn't look like under $500 to me.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I must admit that I have a weakness for phones that are able to take great photos in low light conditions. I love taking pictures from late afternoon to the dead of night. Wish there was a $400 option for that. I've been living off a sluggish hand me down so I can skimp a little on how smooth and efficient it operates so long as it can use android apps and has a decent wifi chip then I should be fine.
L_Shqjv7t2c;What do you mean by the snapdragon 845 is as powerful as the midrange processor released this year? No midrange processoe is as powerful as the 845, not the 675, 730, 730 g.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Ooo £29
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is Nokia bro...
L_Shqjv7t2c;Budget for me is 200 or 250
L_Shqjv7t2c;the a70 seems to have better secs at the same price whitch one should I get a70 or mi 9t
L_Shqjv7t2c;not a single apple phone....
L_Shqjv7t2c;My phone huawei Y9s cost 260$ and its has a 48 mp main, 8mp ultra wide ,2mp depth 4000mah ,kirin 710F , 6.6inch full screen display its better than the note 7 pro at games and has more specs
L_Shqjv7t2c;Make the videos on under 250$ best phones and this video is excellent
L_Shqjv7t2c;I have done a lot of research on phones & tech this is what I found.
L_Shqjv7t2c;TOP 3 PHONES YOU CAN BUY:
L_Shqjv7t2c;1) k20 pro or mi9 pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;2) k20
L_Shqjv7t2c;"Thank god we don't have this Huawei restriction in Europe.  I have the mate 20 btw ;)"
L_Shqjv7t2c;Redmi note 7 for the win
L_Shqjv7t2c;I'm in need of a new phone but my budget is tite.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I have $350 US to spend. Should I get the Pocophone or is it worth going that bit more for the Red Magic 3?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Opinions?
L_Shqjv7t2c;And most of these phones aren’t available in North America like usual...
L_Shqjv7t2c;G7
L_Shqjv7t2c;"I'm not gonna lie. A good half of my murican brain thought there was gonna be ""GeeBees"" mentioned throughout the video. Lol luckily I was wrong, nice content!!!!"
L_Shqjv7t2c;Unfortunately, the A9 from Samsung is missing in your list. A great smartphone and better than the mentioned A70. Fail! 👎🏻
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is pixel 3a
L_Shqjv7t2c;mate20 pro def best
L_Shqjv7t2c;So no one cares about the Huawei p30 lite
L_Shqjv7t2c;The Mi 9T is no K20 Pro, it's the K20. Plus there is still no international version of the K20 Pro. So at this point the Mi 9 is the phone to get, and you can even get it for less than 450$ which is insane value for the moment..
L_Shqjv7t2c;S9+ should be place 14 and Mi Mix 3 place 6 , even mi9 is nearly in the top 3 and is nearly identical with Mix 3
L_Shqjv7t2c;jeez the mi mix 3 is the biggest lie EVER, in the photos, it looks like a full-screen phone where irl you can see it's chin very well
L_Shqjv7t2c;Just give me one... Don't care the specs... Lol
L_Shqjv7t2c;I want a mobile
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about Nokia devices
L_Shqjv7t2c;Honor 20 pro or Samsung Galaxy S9 plus ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Does k20 pro support HDMI output?
L_Shqjv7t2c;which one of these has the best camera? front camera, not for selfies
L_Shqjv7t2c;OnePlus 7 isn't under $500 smh
L_Shqjv7t2c;Plzz tell me which is a better phone among REDMI K20 PRO & HONOR VIEW 20 ...
L_Shqjv7t2c;No Mi 9 SE for us people with small hands?
L_Shqjv7t2c;If you happen to have a one plus 7pro or Huawei p30/mate20pro you don't use you can ship it to me. Hope you contact me on my email: tobeskoza@gmail.com
L_Shqjv7t2c;Tnx
L_Shqjv7t2c;Blackshark?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Technology aside, I freaking love your voice ❤
L_Shqjv7t2c;S10 e p20pro or s9+???
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why there is no any nokia phones in your any list...?
L_Shqjv7t2c;The Samsung a50 is $410 brah.

L_Shqjv7t2c;Got the Xiaomi MI 9T Pro for £289 from Amazon Spain while Amazon UK was selling it for £379. Even got next day delivery to Edinburgh. Absolutely love the phone it's an absolute monster.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Done a speed test between my Honor 20 n the beat the Honor in every department. To top it off an AMOLED screen. Hands down the best phone of 2019.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Please best phones under 300 dollars
L_Shqjv7t2c;Add pocophone
L_Shqjv7t2c;Under 500$
L_Shqjv7t2c;$499,99
L_Shqjv7t2c;Disagree on that Pocophone f1.i went to Mi store to replace my Samsung a6+ then compared both of their shots.bro the camera of the f1 is shit now🤣
L_Shqjv7t2c;My note 9 was 555 and it was before the s10 was announced so it wasn't a bad deal
L_Shqjv7t2c;Bap ko bhul gaye? Pocophone F1
L_Shqjv7t2c;Who else is watching on a samsung galaxy a70
L_Shqjv7t2c;What about the ROG phone 2? It's 509$
L_Shqjv7t2c;"You recommend too many phones!!! I came here to narrow down my selections, not increase them; don't they have HTC where you live!? I have been using nothing but HTC for the past 13 years (+/-) but all the flagships are sold out in Canada so I was going to compromise and try a different brand but I think now that I will just wait instead.... still surprised to not see any HTC in your picks though!"
L_Shqjv7t2c;So mostly Chinese PRC spyware laden treason phones?  Hopefully MI6 is taking note of this video.  Just sayin'.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Which one us better Samsung s9 pro or oneplus 7
L_Shqjv7t2c;Please do a $100 below Phone
L_Shqjv7t2c;I am surprised why oppo Reno 10x zoom doesn’t make your list
L_Shqjv7t2c;Instead of the G7 ThinQ, look for a G7 One. Better Android experience
L_Shqjv7t2c;how the hell is an $1100 iPhone stretching a $500 budget?
L_Shqjv7t2c;You should talk about android updates - for example LG is one the last to update to latest version.
L_Shqjv7t2c;everyone i know is saying i should buy an iphone, i have had my a5 2017 for 2.5 years and i have to say its been a good phone but not really satisfied. i am now looking for the s10 but i am also thinking about an iphone because it just WORKS
L_Shqjv7t2c;S10e is missing ! You can get it for less than 500 already!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Great, well explained and very good video for those who only want to spend $500USD or less on a phone. Even better you go above and beyond by taking about high tier end phones if you have the money, even though you didn’t have to. Plus I have to agree with the other guys that your voice is very smooth and soothing. As for me it looks like I’ll be waiting until the end of the month and picking up the Mate 20X if we have further resolution or it becomes more clear what is going to happen to Huawei phones. The P30 Pro I am intrigued about bc of the improved cameras, but I like having a headphone jack, 7.2 inch immersive screen for watching content, a big battery and want something different from my Note 9 which is also a fantastic phone and whose price has dropped significantly since it came out as well.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Do a video 'best smartphone for each price bracket  $100 $200 ... $1000'
L_Shqjv7t2c;Bro can we import xiomi phones from America???
L_Shqjv7t2c;who seriously likes MIUI
L_Shqjv7t2c;Bro can you please do an unboxing of ZTE axon 10 pro and review, it's better to hear from you. It is loaded with features even 5g capabilities... Ip68 certification, wireless charging, SD855 chip, so on...
L_Shqjv7t2c;look how smart the honor 20 is $499 say whaat! this is letterly under $500!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Damn im glad I watched this video, I want to get the Hauwei Mate 10 Pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;Who wants to have phone that is banned on the other continent. I don't
L_Shqjv7t2c;UMIDIGI A 5 PRO 100 $
L_Shqjv7t2c;All of them costs less than 400 dollars in my country and that is Bangladesh
L_Shqjv7t2c;Best notchless smartphone under $500 please.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Is there any army here...LG g7 thinQ..?
L_Shqjv7t2c;No 1 is S9.....
L_Shqjv7t2c;I've found the LG g8 for $370 refurbished
L_Shqjv7t2c;this is the problem with android phones, so many options, even within the same brand, so many product segments. This can drive consumers insane when they come to the market.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why are there no iPhones
L_Shqjv7t2c;Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is better than all the phones mentioned in video ❤
L_Shqjv7t2c;Hey Aaron, would you recommend me the S10e or the A70, in terms of gaming I prefer the specs of the S10e, but the A70 has some better specs too, but I love the S10e because of Its size and materials quality... I'm messed up, please could you help me?
L_Shqjv7t2c;How about the Oppo Reno?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Ok, so is under 500€ and you have maybe 2 phones that are 1000€
L_Shqjv7t2c;Kind of irresponsible to recommend Huawei devices at the moment. Baking adds into your OS through a system update is just shitty to your consumers and the lack of continuing android support is sure to be an issue.
L_Shqjv7t2c;His voice contradicts his colour
L_Shqjv7t2c;Is that all yours? Can u give me one? Hehe.. Nice top 15 phone. 👍
L_Shqjv7t2c;Hi Arun you mentioned the samsung a 50 in cheaper phones. Would you advice that phone or the samsung s7edge?
L_Shqjv7t2c;One Month's wait for Huawei? Can we expect Price Drop @mrwhosetheboss?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Number 1 , Knew it coming 🤣
L_Shqjv7t2c;#1 Gakaxy S10e, got mine for 400€ and definitely one of the best phones you can get.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Thank you brother
L_Shqjv7t2c;Ireally like your style of presentation.
L_Shqjv7t2c;@mrwhoseboss what about oppo reno10x
L_Shqjv7t2c;S8 squad!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Great video 👍 I would take Pixel a or a XL or Moto G7 power any time great prices jack is back and pure Android no skin or bloat 👍👍👍
L_Shqjv7t2c;Poco f1 29£ 😂😂😂
L_Shqjv7t2c;Jeez these videos are so helpful
L_Shqjv7t2c;I saw your corrective edit as I was rushing to comment... I'll show you who's the boss next time, pun intended. 😶 biggest fan from South Africa
L_Shqjv7t2c;No mention of any headphone jacks...
L_Shqjv7t2c;How about the Honor Play? : (
L_Shqjv7t2c;would you recommend the mi 9se over the mi 8? Pricewise they are very close to each other here in Germany
L_Shqjv7t2c;OnePlus 7 was $529...
L_Shqjv7t2c;Redmi k20 pro prices 360$ not 399$
L_Shqjv7t2c;I found out Huawei P30 (not the P30 Pro) cost $360 only in my country
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why is the Oppo Reno x10 not on this list?
L_Shqjv7t2c;U should try podcasts  your voice is very very pleasant
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why you didn't add Reno 10X zoom
L_Shqjv7t2c;Apple led the sudden $1000 attack on this video
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why you didn't include note 9
L_Shqjv7t2c;K20 pro at #1 was a no brainer
L_Shqjv7t2c;Redmi k20 pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;who wants a huawei p30 pro when I can get a k20 pro,a ps4 and also some other things and still be extremely happy
L_Shqjv7t2c;Phones under £200.....any recommendations?
L_Shqjv7t2c;You need too add euros in the pricing, Btw your content is dope
L_Shqjv7t2c;The Note 9
L_Shqjv7t2c;whats your opinion about black shark 2 smartphone
L_Shqjv7t2c;Hey Arun, there are a TON of smartphones in this price range that have come out (or are currently releasing) since you made this video.  Do you have any new additions to this list?
L_Shqjv7t2c;g7 thinq and pocophone are best fp phones
L_Shqjv7t2c;"""K20 pro is mi9 but better"" I completely disagree you totally ignore a lot of specs the mi9 brings to the table for not so much money.."
L_Shqjv7t2c;The only thing I need to know is can it play high end games and you don't answer that.
L_Shqjv7t2c;wait, wait, wait so u want to tell me that the zen phone is better than the s9 plus. tf?
L_Shqjv7t2c;6:30 - I'm not sure if you answered this question. But why isn't it worth buying the mi9 now?
L_Shqjv7t2c;I would buy Note 9 for that price.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Look!!!! I can T afford changing devices  every year... I have 6s iPhone-Still in Use- my single device since it’s launch 🚀,... ... can I  take the risk buying a android a Samsung or huawei or Other Android mentioned...?... will still be as good in time ?....
L_Shqjv7t2c;I use my phone for pics , looking on Netflix, gmail, social media- is my all... can I do this on android ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;A lot of good phones, and nice summary and good recommendation. Done a while of research, find sadly find K20 Pro unavailable to USA most carriers, as well as Xiaomi, not on T mobile as least.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Zenfone? sadly out of stock, Huawei? risky choice with recent trade issue... So One Plus or the old Samsung to go. (at least for me)
L_Shqjv7t2c;What is the best phone you could get for £200 - £300.
L_Shqjv7t2c;After watching this video and not knowing anything about phones.
L_Shqjv7t2c;S10 5G is crap. I am on my 2nd one and this one also have water ingress problem.
L_Shqjv7t2c;kinda surprised the Pixel 3 or 3axl didn't make the list
L_Shqjv7t2c;Can anyone tell me where to get cheap but new galaxy s9?
L_Shqjv7t2c;╔┓┏╦━━╦┓╔┓╔━━╗ ║┗┛║┗━╣┃║┃║ 0 0 ║ ║┏┓║┏━╣┗╣┗╣╰╯║ ╚┛┗╩━━╩━╩━mrwhostheboss ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;And the pixel 3a is £399
L_Shqjv7t2c;Poco F1 is not £29
L_Shqjv7t2c;Can anyone help me out I'm looking for a phone with a good camera, battery and storage anyone got any suggestions
L_Shqjv7t2c;Addition of OnePlus 7 makes this $500+ comparison , which also makes the whole video click bait.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Best budget phone is redmi note 8 pro. And if you care about display more then go with realme xt. That's all. I'm a mid-range loving guy so I don't know anything much about flagships. So sorry.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I came here not for the phones but for his voice!
L_Shqjv7t2c;I hope you can help me... I’m from Mexico, but I wanna buy the K20 pro but idk where!!!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Im waiting for the unboxing of Asus rog 2 from you
L_Shqjv7t2c;☺☺☺
L_Shqjv7t2c;Hey im from south Africa and most of these phones are super expensive almost 10000 in my counties currency if you were ever interested in a giveaway I would love it . I really love tech but  I can't afford it I always wanted to be like you .
L_Shqjv7t2c;If you ever wanted to do a giveaway I am on Instagram danio_harmse_
L_Shqjv7t2c;You forgot two major game changers..
L_Shqjv7t2c;Oppo reno 10x in flagship market and vivo z1 pro in mid range market!¡??
L_Shqjv7t2c;Funny that in some countries redmi note 8 pro is cheaper than redmi note pro 7
L_Shqjv7t2c;Is K20 pro  as a budget phone still worthy to buy in 2020? or wait another few months to this upcoming budget phones of 2020.Please suggest me,  which one should I go for.  I am in confused.  Thanks
L_Shqjv7t2c;Funny how there are no iPhones here, absolutely no value to iPhones in comparison to pretty much any Android phone these days
L_Shqjv7t2c;Can't believe you forgot samsung s10e in your list !
L_Shqjv7t2c;WTF where is Zenfone 5z, its better than Poco n G7 thinq 😑
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mrwhosetheboss, there is a phone at 263 dollars and it is good. its called REALME 3 PRO. check it out, great value for its price..
L_Shqjv7t2c;No phone can beat mi 9t...beast
L_Shqjv7t2c;yo u missed the oppo reno z its better than all the phones in a much cheaper price.
L_Shqjv7t2c;video of best 2019 phones under 500bucks. a list w/o any 2018 or older phones. Title kinda misleading, should have titled as best phones you can buy right now under 500bucks.
L_Shqjv7t2c;How about Huawei's P20 Pro? Should be around $500 now.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why not Razer smartphone  ??? 😠😡🤔
L_Shqjv7t2c;I need a new phone in the 300-400$ price range. I live in the US and am looking for a phone with a long battery life and good storage. I also watch lots of videos  and movies. I don't game whatsoever, and i don't care for cameras. If anyone can recommend a phone it would be really helpful.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Pocofone F1 price error in GBP! (It says  29 GBP)
L_Shqjv7t2c;Nowadays it doesn't really matter what phone you get as long as it's acceptable you won't really noticed that much of a difference because everything comes down to features now
L_Shqjv7t2c;I got the Mi 9 for 386$
L_Shqjv7t2c;You credit it a lot of people for the sources of mid range and low budget phones Arin,it shows what phones you are using and the ones you don't care about,lucky you you have the means.
L_Shqjv7t2c;mi 9 way better than k20 man
L_Shqjv7t2c;the moment you realize mid range phones are better than the flagship ones
L_Shqjv7t2c;Note 9 500$
L_Shqjv7t2c;MRWHOSETHEBOSS I LOVE U SO MUCH I BEG U TO MAKE A VIDEO TOP PHONES UNDER £400 2019 PLS IM GETTING A NEW PHONE AND IDK WHAT TO GET 😂😂😂 THANKS BROOOOOSKI
L_Shqjv7t2c;I like the most is your sound rather than phones
L_Shqjv7t2c;best photophone? google pixel i guess.
L_Shqjv7t2c;You can buy a LG V40 for less than $300.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why Samsung's note 9 is missing from the list?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Nice video,I like your personality, but next time if you say under $500 don't put phones who are $499 or even a little above $500. Your video started of good but than you brought up the phones which are more expensive or even.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Does redmi have Google play store? In other words is is useful in America?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why did you have just putted pixel 3a xl and not the smaller version 3a. I mean 3a is actually a better buy then the xl version. And i think pixel should have been in the top 5 positions. Because of its camera performance fast update and it also handles everything perfectly because of its stock Android.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I have the Samsung Galaxy A50, and what I can say is, for the money, there ain't nuthin out there that even comes close to this amazing phone! No point in covering what it can do/has (which is a lot!), only that IF wireless charging HAS to be an option, then the A50 won't work for you. Otherwise, the A50 is the best smartphone for the money!
L_Shqjv7t2c;The list pretty accurate.. almost nailed it.. however, I would say Asus zenphone 6 should be at no. 1. K20 pro is a good phone undoubtedly. But Zenphone 6 just takes the cake in the given price segment. Granted there's no amoled on the Asus but the features in the phone just make it the top pick in the segment. Loved the video though.
L_Shqjv7t2c;2:40 why is she driving backwards
L_Shqjv7t2c;can someone help me? I'm not sure if I would buy the Samsung s10e for (530euro) or wait till the xiaomi mi 9 t pro comes to Europe for 350/400euro
L_Shqjv7t2c;you didn't talk about mi8, its a very good smartphone even now
L_Shqjv7t2c;Rather keep my iPhone 7 (new) why you guys what a need phone just get a 8 or note 8 than or 7 or 7 pkus
L_Shqjv7t2c;Idk where your getting these prices. When I check eBay or Amazon it's a totally different story
L_Shqjv7t2c;Great video and informative 🔥🔥🔥
L_Shqjv7t2c;Amazing video, as always!
L_Shqjv7t2c;I am justing looking at the thumbnail for hours. ❤️
L_Shqjv7t2c;Definitely i’ll catch you in the next one!
L_Shqjv7t2c;That was amazing it was the best comparisons ever well done
L_Shqjv7t2c;And please make more videos like this
L_Shqjv7t2c;And again and again well done that was so good
L_Shqjv7t2c;Realme X can replace RN 7 Pro easily!

L_Shqjv7t2c;Hi Aaron,
L_Shqjv7t2c;You missed umidigi S3 pro, it is a good phone in period,
L_Shqjv7t2c;I would like you to revive it!!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Well s9 shall have been on a good position
L_Shqjv7t2c;Still have to wait for k20 pro launch😑
L_Shqjv7t2c;Thanks for the reminder bro i want a camera phone and that's my choice the Huawei P30 Pro but the problems thier facing right now, and they are on sale right now maybe ill be waiting for the decision after the 90 day period..😐😑
L_Shqjv7t2c;no Nova 4  in the list!!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Lol. I never knew MATE 20 also exists. I thought its only MATE 20 PRO 😂
L_Shqjv7t2c;I'm going for the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom.. already pre-ordered.
L_Shqjv7t2c;perfectly balanced video
L_Shqjv7t2c;Which one would be good among mi 9 and k 20 pro for photography?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Do any of these phones work with Verizon in the US?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Anyone see the video of Real Racing 3 was in reverse?
L_Shqjv7t2c;I bought the Mi 9 for 399$ and in my eyes, it's the most affordable smartphone at the Moment, at least in Europa, because we don't get the 9T Pro.
L_Shqjv7t2c;The Axon 10 Pro seems like a bargain for the price, especially with its clean OS. I hope you could review it.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I dont buy new phone every year m still rocking with my s8+
L_Shqjv7t2c;”If you did wanna spend more than that ( referring to $500 )...”

L_Shqjv7t2c;Your voice should be on Google Assistant.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I doubt if the poco f1 is available for 29$ only
L_Shqjv7t2c;Samsung s10e: am i a joke to you?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Anybody got the Zenfone 6 ..
L_Shqjv7t2c;I AM ONLY MAN I HAVE 38 YEARS ,6 YEARS I DONT HAVE PHONE....
L_Shqjv7t2c;Go for Nokia 8.1
L_Shqjv7t2c;one more device must be include..xperia 1
L_Shqjv7t2c;meizu 16th is the best
L_Shqjv7t2c;OP7 is under 500 USD..🤔🤔
L_Shqjv7t2c;Now i wonder which 1 should i buy, red magic or k20 Pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is oppo reno 10x zoom?????
L_Shqjv7t2c;Do under 200$ please. 😅
L_Shqjv7t2c;In 25k Should I go for S9+ ( 6months old ) Or brand new K20 pro. ????? I am highly confusion ???
L_Shqjv7t2c;Mi 9t is the k20 not the k20 pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;What kind of below $500 list is this if you are adding phones above that price? I'm talking about your pick number 4: One Plus 7 for $549
L_Shqjv7t2c;I just bought the Mi9 128Gb for $424.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I would prefer the K20 Pro, but there is no Global version yet, with B20 (800MHz) to work with LTE on rural areas in my country.
L_Shqjv7t2c;So I think, for the moment, the Mi9 is still the best choice.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Only Chinese...  Why???
L_Shqjv7t2c;Please do a top 10 phones under 200$
L_Shqjv7t2c;Thats the way of content making . You just know what people want .
L_Shqjv7t2c;why the Asus 5z is not in the list over poco ?
L_Shqjv7t2c;not Oxygen.      oxygenos
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why don't you take Realme As a good device. It is also under $210.
L_Shqjv7t2c;One plus 7 pro is above $500
L_Shqjv7t2c;I think you forgot the realme x.
L_Shqjv7t2c;This is the best budget bang for your buck phone
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where is Oppo Reno 10x zoom...? better deal than most of thephone listed out there..! Atleast better than One Pus 7 pro and that too in a good price range.
L_Shqjv7t2c;You covered me right at the end! Xiaomi mi 9 SE!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Why you have not include realme x
L_Shqjv7t2c;Wow! I have been educated today. I didn’t know you could get a smart anything for under five hundred dollars. I am a major Apple fan-girl, but not a fan of Apple’s major rise in prices. I have a feeling after my I-phone eight, I am going to reach a point where I can no longer stay in the ecosystem. I am totally blind and I’ve never used any other brand of smart phone so I don’t know what other options (as far as usable screen readers and software) that are available right now. By the time I finish paying off this eight, something new might be around, but you can’t be too careful thinking ahead about this sort of thing since these devices are such an integral part of our lives.
L_Shqjv7t2c;I love my Xiaomi Mix 3 :) I'm not that strict about displays, although it is a good display. The phone is simple and awesome.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Phenomenal list! Amazing video, man! Top notch!
L_Shqjv7t2c;Where's REALME 3 PRO ? 🤔
L_Shqjv7t2c;Love this video, change the headline though make it the best phones to buy now
L_Shqjv7t2c;Great video bro.. 👍👍👍👍👍
L_Shqjv7t2c;Can I have one device from your big collections smart phone,pls pls pls 😂😂😂
L_Shqjv7t2c;Thank you boss. I was confused with asus and mi9. Now I'm again confused with asus and k20.
L_Shqjv7t2c;Thanks
L_Shqjv7t2c;Galaxy A20E/A40?
L_Shqjv7t2c;That's a lot of phones..... 🤗
L_Shqjv7t2c;Very informative
L_Shqjv7t2c;why is the real racing footage in reverse, is it on purpose my man?
L_Shqjv7t2c;you are great
L_Shqjv7t2c;can you review Oppo reno 10x or reno 5G
L_Shqjv7t2c;Bro what about realme 3 pro🙄???
L_Shqjv7t2c;WOW!!!!
L_Shqjv7t2c;K 20 Pro awesome
L_Shqjv7t2c;I recommend F11 Pro
L_Shqjv7t2c;Pocofone f1 £29 wow hook me up
L_Shqjv7t2c;Galaxy s8?
L_Shqjv7t2c;Not redmi , I don't want to see adds 😂

l4h7U6SGOFw;Wallet: Used Nokia 3310 on Sale
l4h7U6SGOFw;Xiaomi K20 Pro,owned for 3 months now and so impressed, fantastic phone while incredible value for money from Wonda Mobile
l4h7U6SGOFw;LCD screen on a Samsung phone? That's weird.
l4h7U6SGOFw;It makes me sad when most of these aren't available in store of mass public. Not everyone need iphone or the latest samsung galaxy.
l4h7U6SGOFw;Sometimes you just need a decent device that does Twitter and calls. That's it...
l4h7U6SGOFw;i love how everyone bullies apple about the headphone jack
l4h7U6SGOFw;Instead of oneplus you could put nova 5t no one knows wth is that phone
l4h7U6SGOFw;Xiaomi is one of the best smartphone manufacturer 👍
l4h7U6SGOFw;My wife is using Xiaomi Mi A3 and she love the phone. For basic staff is great. The selling point is the battery, is amazing.
l4h7U6SGOFw;Ah glad someone noticed my pick Mi a3 Highly underrated Just for a 720p display Trust me guys This should be not a deal Maker or breaker Thanks ASBYT.
l4h7U6SGOFw;Dude all this phones are everywhere.. we all knew that they existed.
l4h7U6SGOFw;I really like Xiaomi's Mi A- series of phones. It basically took over the old Moto G's position back when everyone had a Moto G,G2 and G3 years ago. Good times.
l4h7U6SGOFw;Watching this on my iphone 5s because I’m broke Af
l4h7U6SGOFw;Xiaomi phones are cheap and really good
l4h7U6SGOFw;OP7T is amazing, the Realme X2 pro is amazing for the price, the Xiaomi Mi A3 is the best for the price, overall specs for the price alongside with the software updates is unbeatable, honourable mentions the other Xiaomi's mentioned in the video 👍🏽
l4h7U6SGOFw;"U got my @""not list"" 👍"
l4h7U6SGOFw;I actually didn't know most of these phones bro and I love the Realme one. I think it's super cool and I love the feature of it. it's just amazing.
cpIEWsQpRMk;That moment when MKBHD is better dressed at the smartphone awards than he was at the streamy awards.
cpIEWsQpRMk;In an indian newspaper ..There was an oneplus 6T ad....It mentioned this video..this award.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Back when 5.5 inch display was considered big...
cpIEWsQpRMk;Samartphone looooool.   Am I the only one?
cpIEWsQpRMk;Who’s here after smartphone awards 2019?
cpIEWsQpRMk;"""The OnePlus 6T is going to be a tough act to follow"""
cpIEWsQpRMk;Aaannnnd in come the OnePlus 7 pro
cpIEWsQpRMk;I’m super late but in my country’s national daily, there was an one plus 6t ad where “best smartphone 2018” by MKBHD (youtuber) was printed. 😂😂
cpIEWsQpRMk;smartphone awards by mkbhd :-

cpIEWsQpRMk;Pls make it real
cpIEWsQpRMk;Who is here after Watching Smartphones Awards 2019?

cpIEWsQpRMk;Who else here after his smartphone awards 2019
cpIEWsQpRMk;Why is your intro the Israeli National Anthem 😂😂
cpIEWsQpRMk;If this keeps going this way, believe me, mkbhd awards will be an official and most awaited awards in every year both for user and the company
cpIEWsQpRMk;"Who else noticed the typing error ""the best small samart phone"" lmao"

cpIEWsQpRMk;You should do a security category for 2019.
cpIEWsQpRMk;"""Good phones are getting cheap"
cpIEWsQpRMk;"Cheap phones are getting good """
cpIEWsQpRMk;~Mkbhd 2018
cpIEWsQpRMk;"""Good phones are getting cheap."""
cpIEWsQpRMk;"""Cheap phones are getting good."""
cpIEWsQpRMk;Thanos snaps
cpIEWsQpRMk;Half of it is still true.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Why not to make an award for best phone for communication: Best signal coverage, bands, voice quality in calls, etc. In fact, that is what smartphones were invented for right?
cpIEWsQpRMk;I am now waiting for the 2019 edition the next month
cpIEWsQpRMk;Mkbhd: Shiny Smartphones
cpIEWsQpRMk;Jre: Okay
cpIEWsQpRMk;3 more days to 2019 version.

cpIEWsQpRMk;0:55 you'll see the best big samartphone
cpIEWsQpRMk;I feel proud
cpIEWsQpRMk;As a OnePlus 6t owner 😙
cpIEWsQpRMk;OnePlus gunning for that MVP 2019!
cpIEWsQpRMk;I was starting to sweat when OnePlus 6T didnt get an award after i just bought one lol
cpIEWsQpRMk;2:35 Best Small Samartphone
cpIEWsQpRMk;seems legit
cpIEWsQpRMk;Watching on my note 9 kind of satisfying
cpIEWsQpRMk;I was waiting for the smartphone of the year to be the 6t and was hype when it was actually that
cpIEWsQpRMk;"Ppl in 2018: ""oh nice OnePlus6T is the best phone of 2018...sure hope they can keep it up next year"""
cpIEWsQpRMk;"2019...OnePlus 7 Pro: ""I'm I a joke to you?"""
cpIEWsQpRMk;Me: I think it's about bed time
cpIEWsQpRMk;MKBHD: not so fast pal
cpIEWsQpRMk;Anyone waiting for Smartphone Awards 2019?
cpIEWsQpRMk;honestly was praying for him to pick up the OnePlus 6T before he did😅
cpIEWsQpRMk;0:55 caption error🤨🤨
cpIEWsQpRMk;"2:35 you spelt smartphone as ""samartpnone"""
cpIEWsQpRMk;When you wear a suit for declaring smartphone awards, you know it's serious.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Im voting the samsung s10 for smartphone of the year in 2019
cpIEWsQpRMk;Looking sharp...when is ur 2019 smartphone awards
cpIEWsQpRMk;cant wait for 2019 lmao
cpIEWsQpRMk;"2:33 ""BEST SMALL SAMARTPHONES"" how many of u noticed???"
cpIEWsQpRMk;Can we take a moment to appreciate the production quality of this video? Insane! Good job, MKBHD
cpIEWsQpRMk;I thought the sign on the left was EXO’s logo for Tempo era 😂 omgsh
cpIEWsQpRMk;02:35:00 AM
cpIEWsQpRMk;Also can’t wait for smartphone awards 2019
cpIEWsQpRMk;First time in mkbhd smartphone awards that the MVP didn't come in any category even not the honarable mention but directly the mvp
cpIEWsQpRMk;Well watching this in 4th quarter 2019 to select and buy samartphone best for me and hoping 2018 models price are much cheaper to buy in 2019😉
cpIEWsQpRMk;Marques preparing for the smartphone awards by looking back on all the phones released in 2018
cpIEWsQpRMk;Marques: It's rewind time!!!
cpIEWsQpRMk;It's 2019 but I am still using Iphone 4s on IOS 6.0.4, that alone says that this machine is still going strong.
cpIEWsQpRMk;"""What are you gonna do with all these smartphones? You should give away some that you don't need."""
cpIEWsQpRMk;I’m so happy I saw my fellow iPhone XR in the thumbnail
cpIEWsQpRMk;9:13 Top budget phones.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Thank you Mark Ass, very cool!
cpIEWsQpRMk;Is the intro song a version of the Israeli national anthem, because it sounds like it?
cpIEWsQpRMk;If he was doing this 10 years before, then all the awards were taken by NOKIA itself single handedly. Am glad it's at least in the race now...
cpIEWsQpRMk;I forgot this had the special intro that the 2019 one doesn't but oh well, he made more vids during December so eh
cpIEWsQpRMk;The song in the beginning, does it by any chance have something to do with the national anthem of Israel?
cpIEWsQpRMk;2:24 pewdiepie headphone!!!!  marass brownlee is doing his part
cpIEWsQpRMk;Are we gonna ignore that he has Pewds headphone at 6:37 ??
cpIEWsQpRMk;Waiting for this 2019 year's too!
cpIEWsQpRMk;Watching on my Mate 20x..... And my 20x is MAD. VOLUME is getting louder battery lasting longer, speed is getting faster, screen getting bigger turning into the Hulk. 💪💪💪💪💪. Cool video Brotha. We both know the truth.
cpIEWsQpRMk;its 2019 and still no SONY, they're the most improved of 2019
cpIEWsQpRMk;It feels so...
cpIEWsQpRMk;Professional
cpIEWsQpRMk;Pixel 3 1camera1st
cpIEWsQpRMk;IPhone xs 2 cameras 2nd
cpIEWsQpRMk;Huawei 3cameras 3rd
cpIEWsQpRMk;I just got a 1+6T after suffering with a Nokia 6.1 for the past 9 months. I will never buy a Nokia again. The OnePlus absolutely lives up to the hype.
cpIEWsQpRMk;"MARKASS ""PINECONE' BROWNLEE"
cpIEWsQpRMk;I am currently using OnePlus 6T and I love it! Waiting for the 2019 smartphone awards!
cpIEWsQpRMk;I was about to complain about the abscence of the OP 6T but suddenly it won phone of the year 😂😂
cpIEWsQpRMk;I guess this year we will have the Smoothest Smartphone category.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Lol, gotta love this guy. Very passionate reviewer
cpIEWsQpRMk;Watching this in 2k19 biggest bust of the year gonna go to pixel 4😂
cpIEWsQpRMk;Bro I dig the Christmas lights behind you and suit. Made the phones feel special, especially the $1000+ ones. Haha!
cpIEWsQpRMk;You know you’re the top tech youtuber when you wear a suit for a video 👌🏽
cpIEWsQpRMk;Anyone came back from Smartphone Awards 2019 to see if you can afford 2018 ones?
cpIEWsQpRMk;Prediction: best 2019 small phone, Galaxy S10e.
cpIEWsQpRMk;"""Good phones are getting cheap"
cpIEWsQpRMk;"Cheap phones are getting good"""
cpIEWsQpRMk;Talking about battery life.

cpIEWsQpRMk;Will Smith is satisfied now
cpIEWsQpRMk;2:34 anyone else noticed that they spelt smartphone wrong ?
cpIEWsQpRMk;When you realize that phones win awards and not you .....
cpIEWsQpRMk;I'd like to have one of those small samartphones.
cpIEWsQpRMk;When I heard Anderson .Paak in the intro, I knew this was going to be a special video.
cpIEWsQpRMk;"That moment when 5.5"" is considered small..."
cpIEWsQpRMk;samartphones are the future!!!😅
cpIEWsQpRMk;Good recap, I am sooo hyped for phone awards 2019

cpIEWsQpRMk;JerryRigEverything: Most Durable smartphone awards 😂

cpIEWsQpRMk;I love the smartphone awards!❤ next 2019!
cpIEWsQpRMk;The Oneplus 6t isn’t the best at anything
cpIEWsQpRMk;But it is good at everything
cpIEWsQpRMk;0:55 Best Samartphone?
cpIEWsQpRMk;I expected him to say Apple Watch for the best small smart phone
cpIEWsQpRMk;Sleeping with all those phones would be amazing.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Are you planning making smartphone awards for 2019???
cpIEWsQpRMk;Incoming lawsuits from people named “Samart”
cpIEWsQpRMk;And apparently, Marques will be representing himself 👨🏾‍⚖️
cpIEWsQpRMk;Him be flexin’ with all his phones
cpIEWsQpRMk;"Looking back at this in retrospect after watching the 2019 awards. SMH at the iPhone XS supposedly having ""one of the fastest chips"", when it was completely destroyed by the HTC U12 Plus in real world speed tests."
cpIEWsQpRMk;Can’t wait for the 2019 version
cpIEWsQpRMk;Who else thinks 6-inch display is best and comfortable?
cpIEWsQpRMk;Clap Clap , Welcome to Samartphone Rewind 2018
cpIEWsQpRMk;'The best big samartphones'.. LMAO.. 😂🤣
cpIEWsQpRMk;Slightly surprised Marques didn’t reuplod this video without the “best small samartphone” typo...
cpIEWsQpRMk;I luv u bro...I'm waiting for last moment.coz I'm using OnePlus 6t.
cpIEWsQpRMk;I'm looking for a phone that has:
cpIEWsQpRMk;Good display
cpIEWsQpRMk;Decent battery
cpIEWsQpRMk;Seeing on my OnePlus 6 🥰🥰🥰
cpIEWsQpRMk;00:56 lol samartphone 😂
cpIEWsQpRMk;I just bought a Samsung Note 9 for $300 two weeks ago and after seeing the 2019 awards I had to watch the 2018 awards to see if it got the MVP award. At least it checks every box for 2018.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Can't wait for the 2019 awards :DDD
cpIEWsQpRMk;Thank you Mark Ass, very cool 👌
cpIEWsQpRMk;It's almost that time of the year again... I can't wait!
cpIEWsQpRMk;Neat presentation and good judgement 👍🏻
cpIEWsQpRMk;8:54 who's that 👀
cpIEWsQpRMk;I think the best budget smartphone is probably the Moto g6 (probably because it's my daily driver)
cpIEWsQpRMk;As an owner of the 6T I was getting a little worried for a bit there 😬😅
cpIEWsQpRMk;Watching this on my 6t amazing phone, I think I gotta get the oppo find x tho too..
cpIEWsQpRMk;2019 MVP one plus 7 pro
cpIEWsQpRMk;loving your content, Cheers !
cpIEWsQpRMk;Samartphone bruh you gonna take this and run with it “that was a pun”
cpIEWsQpRMk;This vid will trend not because of these smartphone awards..
cpIEWsQpRMk;But due to the fact that mkbhd wore a suit!!:P
cpIEWsQpRMk;I am so late and thx for intrudicing the best Smartphones in 2018!😉
cpIEWsQpRMk;(Sorry for my english 😔)
cpIEWsQpRMk;No Pixel 3 XL for Smartphone of the Year :(
cpIEWsQpRMk;Love these samartphones　xD
cpIEWsQpRMk;13:10 yeahhh...currently using oneplus 7pro and i love it so muchhh
cpIEWsQpRMk;I was afraid that OnePlus would not be mentioned in the entire video, then, BOOM, MVP babieh!
cpIEWsQpRMk;Yeahhh, i have the smartphone of the Year 🤗
cpIEWsQpRMk;DID HE JUST USE THE ISRAELI ANTHEM AS HIS INTRO VIDEO

If you have any of those phones stocked and no longer being used, I'd appreciate having something from my idol as well as rock a cool phone. Haha! Thanks!

cpIEWsQpRMk;Can i have one!😍😍
cpIEWsQpRMk;"The moment, when ""small"" smartphones have 5.8 inches :D"
cpIEWsQpRMk;0:56 Samartphone
cpIEWsQpRMk;Razer phone most improvement LMAO

cpIEWsQpRMk;anyone tell me the intro music name
cpIEWsQpRMk;Who's here from the live??
cpIEWsQpRMk;I love daily driving my galaxy s8. Doesnt get the best gas milage, but it really is quite fast with its turbocharged 3.5l v6 engine. Very comfortable seats as well.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Hi... friend....this video is awesome...i saw this video so late...i have a great idea to improve this award concept next time..if you like to know that...just reply me
cpIEWsQpRMk;next year maybe you can add 1 more category: best wearables
cpIEWsQpRMk;i wish i could have one the smartphone cause it's really cool
cpIEWsQpRMk;Mark ass Brownlee - Will Smith - 2018
cpIEWsQpRMk;That moment when you hand out awards but can't even spell smartphone. 0:55
cpIEWsQpRMk;Oppo’s os looks very similar to iOS..
cpIEWsQpRMk;Whats the name of the music in the intro
cpIEWsQpRMk;Where is 1+ ??
cpIEWsQpRMk;As a One Plus fan that's been following them since One Plus One, I was prepping a comment in my head about how sad it was to see them not win anything. They're in a weird middle ground where they aren't the cheapest anymore, but aren't the best performing. A weird middle ground they've moved into.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Watching this from nokia 1100
cpIEWsQpRMk;Anyone remember the note 7?
cpIEWsQpRMk;2:36 Samartphone
cpIEWsQpRMk;2:36. Who else noticed the spelling error?
cpIEWsQpRMk;The black diamond on your wall on the left is a bit off...its bothering me...sorry if I ruined the rest of the video for you guys lol

cpIEWsQpRMk;These are my dream smartphones, only dream can't afford it. but its AWESOME sir brownlee
cpIEWsQpRMk;Though u re busy with flagships, can u do a video on minimal phones? That would be very nice. Keep up the good work.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Do 2019
cpIEWsQpRMk;"That moment when 5.5"" is considered small..."
cpIEWsQpRMk;I agree with the battery life. Even though it's not as high end as the mate 20 pro my huawei nova 3e's battery lasts the whole day with 20 or 30 percent to spare
cpIEWsQpRMk;The Note 9 was the best smartphone ever until the s10 plus came out.
cpIEWsQpRMk;REASONS: Headphone Jack, Big Battery, Fast Charging, The Pen, Good Design, Memory Configuration and, even though the camera is not the best it is still great. (I'd choose the S9 plus, the difference in the Battery is too big.
cpIEWsQpRMk;You know you spelled best small smartphones wrong 😀
cpIEWsQpRMk;2:35, SamartPhone
cpIEWsQpRMk;When the budget award winner is out of your budget...
cpIEWsQpRMk;Okay then.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Hey bro give me any phone plse...@mkbhd

cpIEWsQpRMk;best big samartphone.....what is samartphone
cpIEWsQpRMk;I literally ordered the OnePlus 6T a day before this video and I've been super worried since I know no one who owns one and only went off online reviews. Even while watching this video I was hoping to see the OnePlus 6T on one of the lists but the fact that you'd call it the Phone of the Year has made all my worries disappear! I can't wait for it to finally deliver.
cpIEWsQpRMk;I cannot stop staring at the wonky square on the wall. I saw it and cannot unsee it
cpIEWsQpRMk;Best design? OnePlus 7 pro
cpIEWsQpRMk;Samart phone.....

cpIEWsQpRMk;One thing I really appreciate about your content is the presentation. Honestly, I don't even care about technology that much. I watch because of you. You've created an amazing brand.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Pocophone F1 😁😁
cpIEWsQpRMk;The Xiaomi Mi Max 3 has a bigger battery than the Huawei Mate 20 Pro.
cpIEWsQpRMk;Wait.. Isn’t Samsung the first company to use AMOLED?

cpIEWsQpRMk;I thought best budget phone and small sized phone is iPhone SE
cpIEWsQpRMk;Who notes that best small samarthphone 🤣🤣🤣
cpIEWsQpRMk;Just upgraded from Oneplus 1 to the 6T i was still happy with the Oneplus 1 but a bad drop finally killed it :( But at the same time I get to be blown away by the 6t now xD

MiH1D2wsEx8;How many channels do they have?
MiH1D2wsEx8;elle sait même pas et si oui y est
MiH1D2wsEx8;I like having a GPS built into the phone. Smart phones have their great perks. The only thing I don't like now that's happening because of phones is the lack of communication. I see parents that just scroll through their phones while their kids are trying to ask them a question. When a baby starts crying they just hurry up and hand them their phone instead of taking a more personal approach. I'll go into a Dave & Busters and see some people sitting down at the table playing on an app instead of playing the actual games. People putting on movies for a movie night and staring at their phone the entire time.
MiH1D2wsEx8;True!!
MiH1D2wsEx8;very true all now on the phone
MiH1D2wsEx8;What is the kid gonna do if she has no smartphone?

WjckDtz2XhE;Which one is YOUR favourite!? 😋
WjckDtz2XhE;$116 for the phone? Not bad
WjckDtz2XhE;You mean $116 000...
WjckDtz2XhE;Dior is the new iPhone X competitor
WjckDtz2XhE;Who else got this recommended in 2019?
WjckDtz2XhE;Edit: I was scrolling through the comment section and didn't even realize I had this comment. Got clickbaited by YouTube algorithm again lol
WjckDtz2XhE;The thing I don't get about the Razer phone is why they would not have a headphone jack. Especially if it's supposed to be a gaming product. People want a quick response time and wireless headphones aren't any good for that.
WjckDtz2XhE;Dior-0:10
WjckDtz2XhE;kodak-0:53
WjckDtz2XhE;Pepsi-1:57
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer-2:44
WjckDtz2XhE;I think you should make your own phone😆
WjckDtz2XhE;0:53 LOL, I am actually watching this video on a Kodak Ektra....
WjckDtz2XhE;You say I'm mrwhosetheboss so is that a name or a question😂

WjckDtz2XhE;2019 : 64 mp camera and thats nice
WjckDtz2XhE;Another great video from the BOSS...
WjckDtz2XhE;I bursted out laughing when I saw and heard KFC smartphone lmao
WjckDtz2XhE;KFC:We'll make a phone.
WjckDtz2XhE;Chicken:Am I a joke to you?
WjckDtz2XhE;Pepsi one was a bit funny 😂
WjckDtz2XhE;Dior reveries : $116.000
WjckDtz2XhE;01:45:00 AM
WjckDtz2XhE;why dont they just make a smart camera
WjckDtz2XhE;that also can connect to wifi
WjckDtz2XhE;and call ur friends
WjckDtz2XhE;*SOULJIA BOY SMART PHONE*!!!!!!
WjckDtz2XhE;Yoooo i am your biggest faaaaan😘😎😎😎
WjckDtz2XhE;Introducing The Durex Phone
WjckDtz2XhE;"With great virus PROTECTION ;)"
WjckDtz2XhE;That KFC phone is hilarious, imagine if KFC did something like that in the states, oh the songs that would be played.
WjckDtz2XhE;Not first but I'm here nonetheless!

WjckDtz2XhE;Get the boss to a million... come on guys he deserves it

WjckDtz2XhE;Awesome video and didn't know some of these products exist, keep it coming.
WjckDtz2XhE;Tbh if I had to chose between an iphone and a Razer phone I would chose Razer
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer has plans for years to make a phone so I’m not really surprised by that.
WjckDtz2XhE;The way you move your hands and look at them, it's so cringy. It's too much bro. Great vid as always nonetheless. I would just like to point that out.
WjckDtz2XhE;everyone makes smartphones now.

WjckDtz2XhE;Nice video the only smartphone I heard on this list was Razer. KFC smartphone is smart, making it more comfortable to hang out and socialise in store could potentially bring in more money
WjckDtz2XhE;Good but no andorid updates after 1 years like xiaomi
WjckDtz2XhE;Are you single?

WjckDtz2XhE;Didn't expect kfc would do that
WjckDtz2XhE;Good job. Learning something new here. But still not sure about your colors on the new camera. Seems to be lacking some vibrancy.
WjckDtz2XhE;I like Razer phone
WjckDtz2XhE;How is razor unexpected???
WjckDtz2XhE;are you from india
WjckDtz2XhE;Pepsi p1s
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer phone
WjckDtz2XhE;Mr boss U need better editing  skills... ... Please please
WjckDtz2XhE;.
WjckDtz2XhE;DIOR😀
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer phone does make sense
WjckDtz2XhE;What an edit of voice
WjckDtz2XhE;razer phone makes sense?
WjckDtz2XhE;Xperia clone with 120hz display and worse camera and... no headphone jack
WjckDtz2XhE;Wait - Kodak black has a phone or is it the camera company
WjckDtz2XhE;hi mrwhosetheboss
WjckDtz2XhE;LETS WAIT FOR EA ORIGIN SMARTPHONE.
WjckDtz2XhE;pepsi phone i buy 3 but two of them with malware
WjckDtz2XhE;1000th
WjckDtz2XhE;I love your videos Mrwhosetheboss and I am telling this as a friend, the way you you move hand while talking is actually bad, the first thing is that you're simply moving it without much sense, and the second is that it should be done without concentration without effort, something that people do just unaware that they are doing it, I can see you look at how you're moving your hand every 3 seconds. The third is that there is no effort taken in those movements, the hand gestures are done so lethargically.
WjckDtz2XhE;At least the Pepsi phone has a higher resolution display than the iPhone 11.
WjckDtz2XhE;Cool bro
WjckDtz2XhE;My notification arrived 13min later,😣
WjckDtz2XhE;So, who is the boss?
WjckDtz2XhE;I heard the Pepsi smartphone has a malware that installs unsolicited spying apps, which is very weird and dangerous. So don't even bother to buy one.
WjckDtz2XhE;Boss...
WjckDtz2XhE;I've considered the RAzer Phone, but since it didn't reach PT yet, I've just got the oneplus 5T. But the Razer seems a great machine.
WjckDtz2XhE;And then he forgets the Pizza Hut phone
WjckDtz2XhE;Coolest one was The Razer phone as it is a practical design.
WjckDtz2XhE;Bet ya 2 of em will be pepsi and razer
WjckDtz2XhE;KFC one looks similar to iphone 6
WjckDtz2XhE;Old camera.
WjckDtz2XhE;Razor phone for sure
WjckDtz2XhE;You look more at your hands than at the camera.
WjckDtz2XhE;oh
WjckDtz2XhE;do this
WjckDtz2XhE;razer phone vs nvidia shield tablet
WjckDtz2XhE;PEPSI SMARTPHONE
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer phone is the best and powerful .
WjckDtz2XhE;nice
WjckDtz2XhE;Where do you go if you need help with something on your KFC phone? I doubt they’ll be able to help you at a KFC
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer chroma toaster
WjckDtz2XhE;Nice Video
WjckDtz2XhE;Can u look at the camera a bit more?? jeez! you wanna talk to your hands???
WjckDtz2XhE;Pepsi as I am the dealer
WjckDtz2XhE;How is that Marshall phone DAC comparing to the LG V30?
WjckDtz2XhE;The Marshall was awesome, too expensive for me at the time. If they did an other one with good battery life, good enough cameras and powerfull enough, I'd be in. And nothing surprising about the Razer, I loved the design, but Hey I loved Sony Z design. Razer made more than 1 phone, and it's like ASUS ROG phone.
WjckDtz2XhE;Weird choices
WjckDtz2XhE;You forgot the RED hydrogen
WjckDtz2XhE;Drink Pepsi

WjckDtz2XhE;I hope you notice this comment
WjckDtz2XhE;Pls make you videos a little zoomed out giving space for people who invested 1000$ on a phone (you know which) so that they can pinch to zoom and still not lose any important part of the screen.
WjckDtz2XhE;Why is my prescription eyeglasses was made by dior also its the frame not the lens lol

WjckDtz2XhE;The Marshall one looks cool
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer for the display.
WjckDtz2XhE;Just the other day I was at one of those 'Japanese' thrift stores and I saw that Kodak now sells keyboards and mice, but they are on the cheap end and the products reflect the price. I kinda feel sorry for Kodak because since the demise of film cameras they seem to have lost their way, unable to really figure out what to do next. So this video made me think that they need to get on a market that's really selling well these days and that would be smartphones, despite the market starting to plateau. Even at this point smartphones are the most relevant pieces of tech that everyone uses, so maybe Kodak can make a mark on this market and make their name a household name again. But two years after the making of this video it seems like they've given up and now are just content making cheap keyboards.
WjckDtz2XhE;The Huawei KFC phone is P9 lite mini

WjckDtz2XhE;"this video was not bad but after watching many of your videos this video lacked something ;)"
WjckDtz2XhE;Where is Lamborghini alfa 1
WjckDtz2XhE;KFC and Pepsi smartphones? What's next? Mountain Dew and Burger King?
WjckDtz2XhE;Isn't Red about to make their first smartphone?
WjckDtz2XhE;Ok im literally in the drive thru at kfc and hes like KFC MADE A PHONE and im like wtf YouTube recommended me this and ive never been recommended somthing like this
WjckDtz2XhE;I would be happy if Tesla gets into the smartphone industry
WjckDtz2XhE;Canada
WjckDtz2XhE;bell
WjckDtz2XhE;I briefly owned the Puma phone a few years back. It ran a feature phone style os and was quite unique. The phone looked ok but was way too slow to use. Would be a good inclusion if you do a follow up vid :)
WjckDtz2XhE;Lol all are dead
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer
WjckDtz2XhE;1st
WjckDtz2XhE;That KFC phone should have been in the shape of a chicken drumstick.
WjckDtz2XhE;One suggestion
WjckDtz2XhE;.
WjckDtz2XhE;.
WjckDtz2XhE;.
WjckDtz2XhE;How about making a list of the worlds best rugged phones.
WjckDtz2XhE;I liked Razer
WjckDtz2XhE;Why do you keep talking to your hands.hard to focus on the video.
WjckDtz2XhE;Only razer phone is one that someone could buy as daily driver. In terms of gaming and sound it's the best phone. And in other aspects it's not that good but still pretty nice one.
WjckDtz2XhE;Some crossover phone didn't came out as expected features,but is quiet cool,at least is Limited,but without more Commercial.
WjckDtz2XhE;Where's lamborghi
WjckDtz2XhE;Wow I'm currently watching this video on Kodak Ektra... This Ektra isn't that bad, man it's a Deca-Core processor!! And who said the iPhone X's camera is better than Ektra? I tested that and the Ektra is way much better than iPhone X!
WjckDtz2XhE;Lamborghini also created a phone you missed it
WjckDtz2XhE;KFC phone? Why was it not made for the job itself? They could have started a delivery service ... But still it's impressive!
WjckDtz2XhE;these companies didnt make any of the phones listed!!!!!!  they were made for them under licence by mobile phone manufacturing companies.
WjckDtz2XhE;Sorry mate, but I can't stand your hand gestures, it's driving me up the wall. Makes it real hard to watch your videos, which are quite good.
WjckDtz2XhE;No offence you sound squeaky compared to now
WjckDtz2XhE;this was recorded in a toaster but it got better
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer for life.
WjckDtz2XhE;Has Kodak phone, but not RED. 😵
WjckDtz2XhE;I really like your work but your hands are too distracting and the gestures don't make sense and are not consistent
WjckDtz2XhE;I definitely want a Razer phone especially if they release want with 10gb and lots of storage. No I am not a gamer but I listen to YouTube and music videos, this raggedly phone belongs to someone else this or any iPhone 7 plus
WjckDtz2XhE;Everybody now about razer phone
WjckDtz2XhE;The Dior phone surprised me the most also if Dior are making phones then I wouldn't be surprised if Vuitton didn't do one,  along with other high end fashion designers following suit.  merry Christmas Mrwho'stheboss to you and your family🎅🎅🎅
WjckDtz2XhE;tbh, except razer, these are junk phones. even if ppl like audio quality,  compared to lg v30, marshal is trash
WjckDtz2XhE;my black friend asked me iff i could come up with a racist gift that he would actually like. i think the KFC phone is the awnser.
WjckDtz2XhE;Why now YouTube 🙄🙄🙄
WjckDtz2XhE;I'm guessing RED didn't make it because it hasn't been released yet..
WjckDtz2XhE;Where is the lamborghini phone?
WjckDtz2XhE;Kfc phone is manufactured by Huawei
WjckDtz2XhE;Limb category promising athlete doubt relieve barely.
WjckDtz2XhE;you should do a review of the samsung j7 pro a midrange samsung phone available in asia and Europe i bought one the other day wanted to know if i made a good choice cause im not an expert on phones but it has a full metal body which is kinda strange in new phones
WjckDtz2XhE;How you move and look at your hands it's a little cringy
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer is normal
WjckDtz2XhE;StanDby not stanby
WjckDtz2XhE;No.1 should be lamborghini
WjckDtz2XhE;The kfc phone was nothing special... just red huawei p9 lite mini
WjckDtz2XhE;Maybe if diaminds weren't madly overpriced for being so mundane
WjckDtz2XhE;Kodak is also into fashion and hypebeasts are buying too
WjckDtz2XhE;Can phones other then apple's run ios? Not an emulator, not an app and not a case. Full on from the start ios
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer the only good one
WjckDtz2XhE;Marshall headphones are nothing more than a rebadged urban ears. Expensive for what they are and the quality they provide
WjckDtz2XhE;Now that's an ugly phone (Dior)
WjckDtz2XhE;No use full vidio
WjckDtz2XhE;early. kinda late but...
WjckDtz2XhE;Why no red phone
WjckDtz2XhE;Hwy friend there is one more in our country that is cat this is a company of very heavy vehicles which made a monile named cat just check it out on youtube it may be there or on google
WjckDtz2XhE;the reason a expensive 10k+ phone wont really work is cause a phone isnt like a watch that u buy and it works basically forever... its probably outdated in 2-3 years if it is a flagship and the battery will die at some point and its getting slower and slower... the only thing that would work is make a phone that looks the same and have expensive cases^^
WjckDtz2XhE;Talking about Razer without talking about their acquisition of Nextbit
WjckDtz2XhE;Lamborghini phone should also be there in this list
WjckDtz2XhE;Recommended in Sep 2019, I don't know why but the content was still impressive and interesting.
WjckDtz2XhE;I hope they will manufacture the PORNHUB phone... w/c is u can access vip on pornhub... i know it will be a success... lol
WjckDtz2XhE;$116.000 is very misleading. Isn't it $116,000? #justsaying
WjckDtz2XhE;This is CRINGE AF
WjckDtz2XhE;I guess the KFC phone is finger licking good
WjckDtz2XhE;Pepsi owns Quaker and Fritolay
WjckDtz2XhE;You forgot the Polaroid phones which was nothing but junk. I had two of them and both was crap..
WjckDtz2XhE;Dior runners, got a bag for sale
WjckDtz2XhE;His name is not Aaron but Arun
WjckDtz2XhE;That kodak phone would suck today lol budget phones have better cameras
WjckDtz2XhE;The most shocking were the KFC and pepsi. hahahaha They should focus on their food products rather than making shit
WjckDtz2XhE;Lamborghini made  smartphones too. Its called alpha one if im not mistaken.
WjckDtz2XhE;Well... tbf the Razer phone was totally expected. Razer bought Nextbit not so long ago and that really gave it away. Besides the company's area of expertise is electronics and like all other big brands (apple, samsung, etc) it's not uncommon to have laptops and phones..
WjckDtz2XhE;Anyway, nice video, some were indeed really unexpected
WjckDtz2XhE;Google is da best guys Google Pixel 3 is so op Google Pixel 4 is coming soon
WjckDtz2XhE;Mate, it's beyond frustrating that you use unnecessary enumerating gestures every goddamn time!!!! :D
WjckDtz2XhE;The Marshall phone is the more interesting on the list, just needs better specs.
WjckDtz2XhE;I like you're channel but I hate all the jump cuts
WjckDtz2XhE;Lol that dior phone must be trash
WjckDtz2XhE;my fav. is. DIOR handcrafted phone
WjckDtz2XhE;I like the Pepsi best if u think the same give this comment a like
WjckDtz2XhE;Wtf is he doing with his hands??
WjckDtz2XhE;I'd take the KFC phone into their restaurants and play nothing but Nickelback.
WjckDtz2XhE;Saala fake accent
WjckDtz2XhE;.
WjckDtz2XhE;Son, you really should have your own show Aaron. Well versed in gadgets, but some of these are they available ? ...in the United States? Please no made in China they don't last long . Aaron please tell more about Razor and if flip phones is it worth it? Flip phone tech mentioned on YouTube that you can't place a protector over the screen. What is your survey on the Flip Phone(  ANDROID PHONES ONLY I WOULD Want to know)  is it worth it? Is there any phone worth purchasing which is waterproof except
WjckDtz2XhE;The Pepsi phone probably gave users diabetes.
WjckDtz2XhE;Not a surprise you don't say anything about blaupunkt. They try and lose it.
WjckDtz2XhE;Marshall headphones aren't designed by Marshall, the company licensed the brand out to a Swedish fashion/acoustic company (i know, interesting combination, right?) Zound Industries. Zound has leaked eternities ago that they're looking to make Android phones that would fit their consumers' interests, and this is apparently the result.
WjckDtz2XhE;Razer’s phone is not so unexpected cuz why don’t we have a gaming phone
WjckDtz2XhE;"Imo that's a pretty wrong analysis of the Razer Phone niche, most ""hardcore"" pc gamers despise mobile gaming and having a Razer mouse would'nt make any one buy one of these. If anything, the target buyer is probably the opposite of that, and I'd say the people who builds their own PCs and shit would hover more towards the 5T, because of how good it is for the price."
WjckDtz2XhE;Your gestures with your hands are pretty bad, repetitive and irritating. You should take a look at it.
WjckDtz2XhE;I don't know why but in the last few months you haven't produced any real tech content. It has all been about selling phones or talking about weird things that no one cares about. Most of your videos now look like click bait. What happened to this channel? I had high hopes from you..
WjckDtz2XhE;Your hand gestures are odd. Why do you touch your index finger as if you're about to start listing or counting something, and you are actually not? 0:00, 0:03, 0:17, 0:25, 1:41 (not the index but still counts), 1:57 (oooh almost did it), 2:46, 2:50, 3:16, 4:04, 4:09, 4:19
WjckDtz2XhE;Pepsi p1s sucks lol
WjckDtz2XhE;I know it because i used to own one and its strange,it downloads its own application every hour
WjckDtz2XhE;But of course if you disable the wifi it wouldnt download by itself
WjckDtz2XhE;You go to a kfc,you see the huge line and think that you will never get to order,you take out the phone,put the worst music you can think of and boom,you are the only one in the line
WjckDtz2XhE;I thought seriously about buying a Marshall London, but I just can't justify the price for a phone with such low specs. It is unique though, so if I had more money than brains I'd be all over it.
WjckDtz2XhE;54 views 70 likes no dislikes...
WjckDtz2XhE;Good to know no one has their screen placed up-side down.. (Can we get another reply from MrWhosetheboss like the powerbank vid with almost the same comment???????)
WjckDtz2XhE;Dude your hand gestures are so distracting and don't even match up with what you're saying. Do you not know what to do with your hands?
WjckDtz2XhE;Those are all fake
WjckDtz2XhE;The pepsi phone display is better than the iPhone 11 that is really sas
WjckDtz2XhE;Can you give me a Free Pepsi phone
WjckDtz2XhE;Lol every mobile  gamer can agree that tablet is better than phone
WjckDtz2XhE;Ur hand gestures is annoying
WjckDtz2XhE;Ur hand gestures is annoying
WjckDtz2XhE;Pepsi phone is a joke. Even the pepsi drink sucks. Coca-Cola is much better.

_jm0OjEqrts;Moi j’ai l’iPhone 11

_jm0OjEqrts;Alors les huawei sont sur côté ?
_jm0OjEqrts;j'ai le xiaomi redmi note 7 depuis hier et je le trouve super !
_jm0OjEqrts;Super vidéos. Après pour Samsung si on l'achète 'bien' on le revend bien. J'ai acheté mon S10 550€ et je le revendrai jamais sous les 400 d'ici quelques mois. Donc en coût d'utilisation c'est encore moins que les iphones.
_jm0OjEqrts;Quand aux xiaomi c'est vraiment dommage qu'ils n'aient encore que des haut parleurs monos. Quand on y a goûté, impossible de revenir en arrière.
_jm0OjEqrts;Ta oublié le mate 20 pro
_jm0OjEqrts;hyper drole mdrrrr
_jm0OjEqrts;Questions aux internautes et à Dadyy : Mi9 T pro ou Samsung S10E ?
_jm0OjEqrts;J'ai commander mon xiaomi mi 9t pro ya 1semaine, et ça comfirme mon choix😁😁
_jm0OjEqrts;iPhone 11 Pro Max, expérience utilisateur imbattable
_jm0OjEqrts;Redmi note 8 pro👍👍👍
_jm0OjEqrts;Grand merci à toi, depuis les precedent test, je me suis procuré le mi 9 t pro, j'en sui hyper satisfait, c'est une machine de guerre !! Continue comme ca 😉
_jm0OjEqrts;"Pour moi l'iPhone Pro Max est le meilleur smartphone sinon; Rapport qualité prix c'est le Xiaomi MI 9T Pro ( que tu ne m'as toujours pas offert ) est pas mal !"
_jm0OjEqrts;On a tous une préférence pour telle ou telle marque, donc ta vidéo et cool car même si tes super fan de Xiaomi , t'enfonce pas trop les autres .
_jm0OjEqrts;Perso je suis passé d'un Huawei P20 que j'adore ( tout et parfait sur se phone ) a un géant OnePlus7 T pro McLaren !
_jm0OjEqrts;Quoi moi jau le vieux J5 2016 Galaxy jregarde des film tout les jour avec y tien toute une journée et le telephone du top 1 y dure moin long temp
_jm0OjEqrts;Le redmi note 10 sort quand en France svp ? il m’intéresse de ouf !
_jm0OjEqrts;je prend le k20 pro mrc tu m'a super bien aider!!!!!!!!
_jm0OjEqrts;le meilleur c'est le Samsung S10+
_jm0OjEqrts;Je viens de changer pour un note 10 plus
_jm0OjEqrts;Pixel 4
_jm0OjEqrts;Au fait on est en 2020 ?
_jm0OjEqrts;C'est drôle il n'y a pas le Xiaomi mi 9
_jm0OjEqrts;il est nulle ton classement patates
_jm0OjEqrts;Le p30 pro pas dans le classement car il n'a pas sa place dans le classement mieux vaut être sourd que d'entendre ça. Le mi note 10 magnifique ?? alors que c'est une pâle copie du p30 pro en plus lourd et plus épais avec des finitions moins premium. Une tuerie en photo ?? alors qu'il faut 5 secondes entre chaque prise de photos en 108 Mp. Des performances bonnes pour un téléphone de 2018 et même pas de Dolby Atmos... sans parler de l'avis sur le Oneplus 7 pro à la limite de la caricature. Ouais ouais ouais comment dire....je pensais voir une vidéo constructive et pertinente là j'ai l'impression d'avoir regardé une publicité de xiaomi + apple au passage sur fond de rhinoshield. On va pas dislike par respect pour le travail demandé pour réaliser cette vidéo mais ça le mériterait presque.
_jm0OjEqrts;Le meilleur et le Samsung galaxy trend
_jm0OjEqrts;Toujours aussi bons tes tests ! J'ai totalement confiance. Merci beaucoup daddy. Et ce mi note 10 .... Il est trop tentant. Il va faire des ravages et faire frissonner la concurrence. J'ai regardé les tests photos... Ohlala ! Et classé premier dans le dxo mark !!!  Bonne journée
_jm0OjEqrts;Un Vivo Nex 3 aurait pu faire partie des meilleurs je pense.
_jm0OjEqrts;Ranger vos B*tes les gars, 2019 c'est fini dans 20 jours, nos portable seront hass been dans 2 moi 😢😁
_jm0OjEqrts;Plus sérieusement j'ai très hésiter sur le mi 9tpro et oneplus 7t pro, pour moi les deux ce rapproche mais le Xiaomi et un cran en dessous quand même, mais le prix n'est pas le même c'est vrai.
_jm0OjEqrts;J'ai vu le mi note 10 a 370€ sur Rakuten, je l'ai acheté ya 1 mois à 450, je le conseil chaudement, pour tout ce qui est consommation de contenu multimédia, et phots...je crois qu'à ce prix là on a pas meilleur appareil !
_jm0OjEqrts;Je vien de la chaîne duo
_jm0OjEqrts;Tu pourrais demander a Rhinoshield qu'il fasse une coque pour mi 9t pro stpppppp j'en veut trop une
_jm0OjEqrts;Franchement mettre un titre pareil et ne pas avoir le P 30 pro je trouve ça du foutage de gueule, surtout que tout le monde sait que c'est le meilleur smartphone 2019 en termes de photos et de batterie,  je trouve ça absolument pas professionnel, voilà .
_jm0OjEqrts;L'Iphone 11 pro max est presque parfait, mais l'encouche dans un téléphone est VRAIMENT dérangente
_jm0OjEqrts;Le mate 20 pro que je possèdais avant étais ouf😊
_jm0OjEqrts;Mon reuf dort un peu ta des sernes tu peux ranger ton portable dedans

x0EZv0LhNIk;6:36 it's a great display made by samsung.
x0EZv0LhNIk;The galaxy note 9 has the best camera. How dare you!
x0EZv0LhNIk;Thanks for recommendation of poco f1.... I just ordered online..... Thanks bro
x0EZv0LhNIk;I skipped the part about iphone. Simply not interested. N O T!
x0EZv0LhNIk;Great video. I’m a one plus 6t fan but the poco phone for my son. Brilliant price.
x0EZv0LhNIk;You wasted much money to make it so i subscribed
x0EZv0LhNIk;One plus 6t mi mix 3 is my best choice.. i love those two smartphone
x0EZv0LhNIk;NOTE 9, One Plus 6T and Mi A2 are the best!
x0EZv0LhNIk;I was about to end the video but then I saw the back of the phone the one and only Pocophone f1 I soo agree
x0EZv0LhNIk;Already have the best smartphone of the year!(according to Marques Brownlee)

x0EZv0LhNIk;LG V40 should be here!:)
x0EZv0LhNIk;The F1 is great  price, 845 chip , 4000mah battery
x0EZv0LhNIk;Mi Mix 3 with bigger battery, 90hz screen, inscreen fingerprint, and SD 855. Would be a dream phone.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Watching on my one plus 6T
x0EZv0LhNIk;I won the one plus 6t and it is pretty good though I would say my favorite phone on this list is either Xiaomi mi mix 3 or one plus 6t
x0EZv0LhNIk;Btw which one do you prefer ..i dont think you told us
x0EZv0LhNIk;I really dig the fact that Mi A2 was included in the your list amidst the lot of flagship phones.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Can you do a Honor 10 vs Honor 10 lite or a Honor 10 lite vs huawei p smart 2019
x0EZv0LhNIk;Honor V20 blows everything away.
x0EZv0LhNIk;im buying the pocophone f1 as we speak XD 8-19 business days tho :( and the screen protectors
x0EZv0LhNIk; are 18 business days

x0EZv0LhNIk;My S6 has reached the end of its life span. Time to do some research

x0EZv0LhNIk;Thank you and finally the next stepping up against the Pixel 3! I've been ranting here and there about my horrible experiences with the pixel 3 and most snowflakes weren't able to handle it.. If it works for you then absolutely all the power to you, but the price increase and therefor what you get for it is hugely disappointing.. All other you've mentioned are pretty much spot on!
x0EZv0LhNIk;Already ordered for the Mix 2s for 380 usd before watching this.
x0EZv0LhNIk;I hope it was a great choice.

x0EZv0LhNIk;And after all that.. What phone should i buy?
x0EZv0LhNIk;I like what you said about being stuck in the Apple ecosystem. I have personally had that issue myself and I want to get out, which is why I watched this video. I've been browsing phones recently and in terms of getting the biggest bang for your buck, I think I may get the Oneplus 6t. On top of it being an essentially beautiful phone, I have always been a huge fan of McLaren.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Xiaomi MI 9?
x0EZv0LhNIk;was getting excited on the first one till the no headphone jack feature
x0EZv0LhNIk;What was that on 6:12???!!!!
x0EZv0LhNIk;I want this one plus 6t
x0EZv0LhNIk;Best intro
x0EZv0LhNIk;Hi mate. Love your videos and you are good to watch lol. I’m fed up with my iPhone 7. I use Spotify and I cant get rid of the default Apple Music on my phone which I hate. So whenever I turn my car on it defaults to Apple Music. I want it to default to Spotify. I also want to ask my phone to play a song but Siri doesn’t recognise any other music provider. I’m thinking of selling it and buying a Huawei phone. Thoughts????
x0EZv0LhNIk;I hope Samsung will address the camera issues in their coming future updates. In certain lighting conditions it didn't perform good compared to my older iPhone 7 plus.
x0EZv0LhNIk;would u recommend getting rid of my se for the p20 pro
x0EZv0LhNIk;Mi Mix 3 Best one
x0EZv0LhNIk;I just I just a new phone #

x0EZv0LhNIk;You missed the NOKIA 7 Plus, which is an awesome phone, but also HMD/NOKIA as an amazing comeback company from the jaws of Microsoft, who tried to break them apart with the end of Windows Phone... and now in just 18 months NOKIA are becoming one of the best devs around...
x0EZv0LhNIk;No s9 plus???
x0EZv0LhNIk;Note 9 camera is awesome! Best low light camera I have ever had!
x0EZv0LhNIk;What were you doing at the time of 2:01 minutes?

x0EZv0LhNIk;Thnx for the aspect ratio😍and you should also.put s9+
x0EZv0LhNIk;I think ALL smartphones are good 🙂
x0EZv0LhNIk;Any of themmm
x0EZv0LhNIk;"I am very happy with my S7 which has taken some amazing shots over the past 2.5 years (of course, I bought it at a premium price back then); my next phone will be more middle priced since the camera improvements have probably slowed down quite a bit and I will be most satisfied with a price-for-quality kind of a deal"
x0EZv0LhNIk;I am buy a vivo v15
x0EZv0LhNIk;Xiaomi Pocophone F1

x0EZv0LhNIk;I'm on a Thunder Purple OnePlus 6T. It is so good that I think I will rock it till it dies. Thinking of getting a Mi A2 for my daughter. Because of the Android One program.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Budget phone? HELL NAW
x0EZv0LhNIk;LG K30 is my favorite phone.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Xs max for me. Note 9 for me. 6t for me. Poco for my brother. And again the pixel 3 xl for me.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Loved all the phones.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Which one is thw best?
x0EZv0LhNIk;what is the intro music?
x0EZv0LhNIk;Awesome
x0EZv0LhNIk;nah!!! Xiaomi mi note 7 will kill your damn Phones!
x0EZv0LhNIk;My favourite is the Samsung Galaxy s10, to bad he didn't review it.
x0EZv0LhNIk;I heard from your VID that for you pixel 3 is top 2 for camera. What is the best camera phone for you??
x0EZv0LhNIk;Why do you have 33,680 unchecked emails, or just emails notifications on the Gmail app?
x0EZv0LhNIk;Iphone 4s is the best phone ever
x0EZv0LhNIk;After using Windows Phones for years, I switched to the One Plus 6T. I detest both Android and Apple OS, but with my Alcatel Idol 4S being the last decent Windows product that we're likely to get, Android was the lesser of two evils. I actually love the Android Pie with Oxygen OS because of the 6T's rapid response---It's almost as easy to use as my Windows 10 was. The camera may not be the best out there, but it suits my needs. I don't need a headphone jack and the built-in storage should last me years, since my previous 64 GB SD card lasted me over 4 years and still had a lot of space on it....
x0EZv0LhNIk;Best smart pohn apple and offo
x0EZv0LhNIk;UMIDIGI UMI Z2 PRO
x0EZv0LhNIk;Where's the asus?
x0EZv0LhNIk;Best buy now is LG G7 for 400,-
x0EZv0LhNIk;Where is my j6 is 2018
x0EZv0LhNIk;how do you feel about the regular pixel 3?
x0EZv0LhNIk;still waiting pocofone F2.....
x0EZv0LhNIk;✋🏻👍🏽 agree with iphone photo quality 😭
x0EZv0LhNIk;Go Xs Max
x0EZv0LhNIk;where is the mi 9 or wauwei p30 pro?
x0EZv0LhNIk;These are like gold chains to me
x0EZv0LhNIk;@asbyt What of the samsung note 8? Goes for less than $500 on eBay?
x0EZv0LhNIk;So you bite your nails too. :P
x0EZv0LhNIk;What happen to the LG V40?
x0EZv0LhNIk;I think the Sony experia z3 has come out of the bad Sony phones that came before it and I hope Sony continues to up its game in 2019...
x0EZv0LhNIk;Vivo NEX?
x0EZv0LhNIk;POCOPHONE F1 IS MY TREASURE
x0EZv0LhNIk;06:11:00 AM
x0EZv0LhNIk; wtf !!!!!!!!!
x0EZv0LhNIk;"Okay. I can't remember if this correct or not BUT I believe the ""downside"" of the Mix Mix 3 (in ASBYT's case Beautifying photos) isn't really a downside. You have to take into consideration that he has bought the CHINESE ROM EDITION, hence the features in it are targeted to the Asian market. If I am correct, I believe in the GLOBAL ROM VERSION the beauty mode within the camera can be disabled COMPLETELY unlike the Chinese ROM."
x0EZv0LhNIk;Lol. Ok 👻arhrico
x0EZv0LhNIk;https://amzn.to/2DacyhW
x0EZv0LhNIk;That's fart 2:04
x0EZv0LhNIk;06:11 a little pink guy breaking out...
x0EZv0LhNIk;My current favorite smartphone is the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 just because it doesn't have a notch and it has a headphone jack. And the S-Pen just is an added advantage. So yeah, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
x0EZv0LhNIk;V40 it's Quad HD full vision 1440 x 3120 resolution 537 pixels per inch 32-bit Hi-Fi quad DAC 5 cameras with manual camera modes and pro video modes the list goes on my dude
x0EZv0LhNIk;I love absyt videos
x0EZv0LhNIk;Can i have anyone of that.? 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
x0EZv0LhNIk;I phone lovers like here and samsu g lovers comment
x0EZv0LhNIk;Thanks for the 18:9 aspect ratio 👌🤙🤝
x0EZv0LhNIk;The 6T is still just about my favourite device of 2018, but it's a shame about the pointless fingerprint sensor and the extra bulk it's gained from the 5T though. The only 2 things stopping me upgrading from the 5T. The Pixel 3 XL is by far the biggest disappointment of 2018, possibly the most disappointing device ever released actually, you hit the nail bang on the head, what the hell were they thinking?!
x0EZv0LhNIk;You forgot the sony xz3. He beat them all :)
x0EZv0LhNIk;I REALLY WANT TO GET A NEW HUAWEI PHONE 😣 Sadly, I'm in the US and I might not be able to use it. GAHH 😫 WHY?!
x0EZv0LhNIk;Xiaome is cool
x0EZv0LhNIk;Lol I thought it wasn't gonna be on the list
x0EZv0LhNIk;Huawei mate 20 pro 😍😍
x0EZv0LhNIk;It is the the beat phone but for the price so no and what happened to the Huawei mate 20 pro
x0EZv0LhNIk;Huawei???
x0EZv0LhNIk;Xiqomi mi A2 owner, and it is greeeeeeeaaaatttt 😁
x0EZv0LhNIk;Hi u are awesome
x0EZv0LhNIk;Leave note 9 alone ... the only phone got the word SMARTPHONE !
x0EZv0LhNIk;the mix 3 is fooking beautiful
x0EZv0LhNIk;My fave is s 10 plus
x0EZv0LhNIk;Is there a such thing as a fastest 4g phone?
x0EZv0LhNIk;My TOP 5:
x0EZv0LhNIk;-Xiaomi MIX 3 (best for design)
x0EZv0LhNIk;-Mate 20 Pro (good for camera)
x0EZv0LhNIk;-iPhone XS (overpriced, but very very good phone)
x0EZv0LhNIk;IN MY OPINION, YOU WILL BE MY HUSBAND VERY SOON.
x0EZv0LhNIk;"In myyyy opinion lol thanks for the overview; I'd never heard of Xiaomi. Whats wrong with Honor 10 lite? compared to Xiomi Mi A2 isn't the storage better?"
x0EZv0LhNIk;Mate 20 pro
x0EZv0LhNIk;with phone are u saying is the best i hate what u say about the Samsung note9 open your eyes pls
x0EZv0LhNIk;Mi MIX 3....
x0EZv0LhNIk;The A9
x0EZv0LhNIk;Poco f1 is best,powerful and fastest smartphone as a midrange phone . I have been using it for 2 month and I would give it a 5 star rating.
x0EZv0LhNIk;https://youtu.be/LSsE7ST47Ig
x0EZv0LhNIk;What's your personal favorite?
x0EZv0LhNIk;When I had my iPhone 6 apple did the update to ruin the battery, when I went to have it replaced at the apple store they treated me terribly, I then paid out my contract which was $300, and got the iPhone 8, 4-5 months In i had nothing but problems with it and i had the warranty, i was taking it to apple every second weekend, and they wouldn't do anything about it. So I traded my iPhone 8 for a Samsung s8 plus, and I have not had a single problem since, there hasn't been a day i have regretted it. I cant even imagine using an iPhone again. I love the features of Samsung. The Samsung s6 has more and better features than the newest iPhone.
x0EZv0LhNIk;I want the ipnoe xs mas too
x0EZv0LhNIk;Mate 20 pro
x0EZv0LhNIk;In terms of war performance?
x0EZv0LhNIk;Though it hasn't been released either in China or globally, I think that one of the best, premium, affordable phones going all the way through the year of 2019, will be the Honor V20, imo beating out the Oneplus 6T in terms of price, power and camera.
x0EZv0LhNIk;You could also consider the Huawei Nova 4 to be a serious competitor, to the Oneplus 6T, which has been released to China, just not worldwide.
x0EZv0LhNIk;Im using nokia 8 hmmm all i can say small screen but great
x0EZv0LhNIk;I refuse to listen to someone that recommends an iphone
x0EZv0LhNIk;U could of done the p20 lite
x0EZv0LhNIk;Are you using any of them ??
x0EZv0LhNIk;#1 phone to buy is the Note 9 without a doubt
x0EZv0LhNIk;In top 7 .. Which one is the BEST...🤔🤔🤔
x0EZv0LhNIk;My address 162 b.h.s. Allapur Allahabad India
x0EZv0LhNIk;HOW ABOUT OPPO F9 ? CAN ANYBODY TELL ME
x0EZv0LhNIk;Does one plus 6t support dual volte simultaneously?
x0EZv0LhNIk;Cool! I'll buy me the Google Pixel 3 XL soon!
x0EZv0LhNIk;2:20 redmi note 7 costs the same and its hell  alot of better
x0EZv0LhNIk;Lemme at that phone
x0EZv0LhNIk;if you have the budget note 9 all the way
x0EZv0LhNIk;What if you lost it 😱😱😱
x0EZv0LhNIk;The v40 should be up there
x0EZv0LhNIk;Umidigi one pro!!!!!
x0EZv0LhNIk;Blu is my top one😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😋😎
x0EZv0LhNIk;Technology advancements are fascinating but arent the top phones overpriced??
x0EZv0LhNIk;You have to say  something  about  the zenfone 5   or zenfone 5 max pro m2
x0EZv0LhNIk;Samsung Galaxy S9 + it has the best display I've ever seen in person the Dual stereo surround sound speakers (Dolby Atmos )and the phone is super fast and zippy it's just an all-around awesome phone and I almost forgot the cameras are some of the best on any smartphone on the market.
x0EZv0LhNIk;i'm just watching but not buy them:-(
x0EZv0LhNIk;Where is Samsung A7 2018
x0EZv0LhNIk;Honor view 20 da best
x0EZv0LhNIk;Why are phones so goddamn big these days. It's more like a tablet top 7!
x0EZv0LhNIk;What about Honor Magic 2?
x0EZv0LhNIk;Bro can i have that Note 9.,,?birthday presence for me...your the best!!!
x0EZv0LhNIk;funny at 6:20
x0EZv0LhNIk;Lol... You forgot honor view 20..its a beast

rvK2eedlaXY;Few points to note:
rvK2eedlaXY;1. This is a summary of the best smartphones to get in 2019 SO FAR, for if you wanted to buy a phone now.  Obviously there'll be plenty more, and I will summarise all of them at the end of the year!
rvK2eedlaXY;2. The rank order is personal preference, and it may vary somewhat for each buyer depending on exactly what features you're looking for.
rvK2eedlaXY;Ok Google.
rvK2eedlaXY;How come you haven't hired Arun's voice yet??
rvK2eedlaXY;Most comments are about his voice.. understandable
rvK2eedlaXY;i love how iphone doesn’t even make it in the top 10 thats just hilarious
rvK2eedlaXY;That voice
rvK2eedlaXY;Can I use your voice to replace siri?
rvK2eedlaXY;Dude, I need your voice for my Google maps pronto.
rvK2eedlaXY;I like how half of the top 5 smartphone is Samsung.
rvK2eedlaXY;I get Trypophobia looking at the Nokia 9 Pureview's cameras
rvK2eedlaXY;imagine Arun sitting by a fire place in an ancient castle reading a story?  Ya we'll pay for that! Great voice and great review
rvK2eedlaXY;And what are the features of your voice?
rvK2eedlaXY;10. Pixel 3 XL
rvK2eedlaXY;9. Pocophone F1
rvK2eedlaXY;8. One plus 6T
rvK2eedlaXY;7. Mate 20 Pro
rvK2eedlaXY;Why is everyone just commenting on his voice
rvK2eedlaXY;love the clarity of your voice man. forgot this is a review lol
rvK2eedlaXY;So.... when you yell, do you still sound beautiful or...?
rvK2eedlaXY;“Alexa, change your voice to Arun’s” Alexa: “Downloading Arun’s voice”
rvK2eedlaXY;In love with the man's voice and accent
rvK2eedlaXY;Did you know:
rvK2eedlaXY;Most of phones on the world is made by China, yet most of the phone inside the review are made on china.
rvK2eedlaXY;Next time can you pls say wich one is the best choise for that price range
rvK2eedlaXY;Like 150 to 300
rvK2eedlaXY;300 to 500
rvK2eedlaXY;500 to 700 .....
rvK2eedlaXY;"Never thought I'd be alive when the Galaxy Note 9 would be on a ""not recommended"" list"
rvK2eedlaXY;Strange, strange times we live in
rvK2eedlaXY;You should actually categorise according to budget and also name the best in each category(feature wise like camera, battery, all rounder, multimedia etc)
rvK2eedlaXY;Man. That list just got wrecked by the Huawei news.
rvK2eedlaXY;The infinity or edge less screen on smartphone won over all scepticism and become the way of seeing a mobile phones display  throughout all smartphone makers🎸✌🍟🍒🏧⚽🎾🎱
rvK2eedlaXY;Omg I love your accent.
rvK2eedlaXY;"My Google assistant got activated when you said ""ok google"" 🤣🤣"
rvK2eedlaXY;You sound like a charming villain...and I love it.
rvK2eedlaXY;Wow that voice 😍. I forgot to pay attention to the actual review. You should work for Audible.
rvK2eedlaXY;Poco f1 down here,cant be more happier
rvK2eedlaXY;I'll buy whatever phone company hires you to exclusively do their voice over, alarm feature, put me to sleep feature, bed talk feature. You'd fit well in every category
rvK2eedlaXY;LG G8:
rvK2eedlaXY;- Headphone Jack
rvK2eedlaXY;- DAC with best in class audio performance
rvK2eedlaXY;- Expandable Storage up to 2TB
rvK2eedlaXY;Once ive heard ur voice, i forgot about my purposed to see “which phone is better” to grab. Damn mannn.
rvK2eedlaXY;Im using my s10+ and I love Love LOVE my phone!!! No regret!
rvK2eedlaXY;I’m curious to see where the OnePlus 7 Pro would fall! Awesome video!
rvK2eedlaXY;Just know that by end of May 2019, Huawei fell off the list, due to embargo enforced by the USA. Many manufacturers of software will not let their stuff work on Huawei anymore.
rvK2eedlaXY;.so is it safe to say that his voice is the best on the line of reviewers/vloggers???
rvK2eedlaXY;can you do this kind of video again before 2019 ends...please
rvK2eedlaXY;I've came here to read comments, too early i guess ill just come back after some time 😁
rvK2eedlaXY;Sadly, I can't afford any of these phones
rvK2eedlaXY;Is it just me or does he kinda sounds like Simon Cowell....
rvK2eedlaXY;So I'm assuming the S10+ is to he best phone?
rvK2eedlaXY;all those updated smartphones and yet i'm still using my motorola phone haha
rvK2eedlaXY;S10 5G for must of us Unreachable!
rvK2eedlaXY;Greetings from Mexico City Mexico

rvK2eedlaXY;Bro what are you going to do with all these phones just give me one
rvK2eedlaXY;Chinese brands are gonna take over the world.
rvK2eedlaXY;Samsung really killed it this year.
rvK2eedlaXY;Was going to buy the OP6T, but dad gifted me an S10.
rvK2eedlaXY;It's plain SUPERB.

HVDK6nu5VE0;N'est ce pas le moment de craquer avant Noel ?? Bon visionnage ! ❤️
HVDK6nu5VE0;De toute façon a moins de 300€ c'est que Xiaomi pour moi et pour beaucoup de monde je pense ♥️
HVDK6nu5VE0;Xiaomi c'est la vie. A la maison nous avons la balance, la lampe, les écouteurs, le PC portable, l'enceinte... et rien à redire. C'est du Xiaomi ❤❤❤❤
HVDK6nu5VE0;00:00 qu'es ce que c'est trop bien la vie d'artiste
HVDK6nu5VE0;Bon ça va, j'ai bien prononcé Huawei là ?
HVDK6nu5VE0;J'adore les vidéos où vous présentez des smartphones pas trop cher parce que la majorité des gens achètent ceux là et pas des s10 ou des iPhone 11 pro. 👍
HVDK6nu5VE0;Moi j'ai un Galaxy A40 et il est très bien 👌
HVDK6nu5VE0;Le Redmi Note 8 pro reste le meilleur rapport qualité prix grâce a son Mediatek Hélio G90T optimale pour du gaming
HVDK6nu5VE0;Très bonne vidéo pour les petits budgets 😊
HVDK6nu5VE0;Le Redmi Note 8 Pro succède aux RN7 Pro (Pas vendu en Europe) et RN6 Pro (lui vendu en Europe)
HVDK6nu5VE0;J'ai le dernier Xiaomi (le Mi 9T) et oui, il est ouf
HVDK6nu5VE0;Tu présentes le a40 mais j'ai eu le a50 pour 280€
HVDK6nu5VE0;"""Du coup""  j'ai mis un pouce bleu...!"
HVDK6nu5VE0;Je confirme le mi9 lite est un rapport qualité prix juste énorme a tout niveau 🤜
HVDK6nu5VE0;Bravo pour les 200000 🎉
HVDK6nu5VE0;J'ai acheté le Huawei P Smart Z et franchement il est magnifique
HVDK6nu5VE0;Autant prendre le galaxy a50 que j'ai eu a 220€ sur rakuten ^^
HVDK6nu5VE0;Super classement mais le mi 9t se trouve facilement a moins de 300€ sur beaucoup de sites français via des vendeurs chinois market place avec des stocks en France comme sur Cdiscount, Fnac... Et donc pas besoin d'attendre des semaines pour le recevoir (aux alentours des 265 euros avec maximum 3 jours de livraison et si membres premium la livraison peut être faite le lendemain) c'est possible de le trouver encore moins cher sur des sites chinois fiable comme Aliexpress, gearbest... Pour moins de 250€ avec environ 2 à 3 semaines de délais de livraison. Sincèrement le mi 9t mets 1000/0 à la concurrence sur cette gamme de prix, Samsung A40, A50, A60, A70 sont tous en dessous à tout les niveaux que se soit le design, finition (verre et métal) pour cette gamme de prix Samsung vous propose du plastique 🤣 (les tarba) le processeur du mi 9t est largement au dessus de celui du A70 qui est vendu a 400€ (snapdragon 675😂) les photos du mi 9 t sont superbes, sont autonomie au dessus de la moyenne, son chargeur rapide, sa caméra pop-up rétro éclairé par led qui clignote aussi pour les notifications, le soucis du détail pour ce téléphone c'est simplement hallucinants et son écran OLED est super lumineux et bien calibré ya rien à dire c'est du super boulot. La seule concurrence du Xiaomi mi 9t vient directement de Xiaomi/redmi avec des model comme le mi 9 SE ou le redmi note 8 pro et peut être le realme x2 qui très bon sur le papier niveau spec... Pour ceux qui ont moins de 150 € de budget je vous conseille le Xiaomi mi A3 qui se négocie aux alentours des 140€ sur Cdiscount ou même 130€ sur d'autres sites... Niveau perf/design/prix c'est imbattable 😉 le prix d'un Samsung A10 qui est pourri à tout les niveaux 🤣 si vous cherchez un smartphone à moins de 100€ (90€ environ) selon moi il y a l'excellent Umidigi A5 pro qui est juste hallucinant tant par sa finition que pour son hardware. Ça c'est cadeau c'est pour moi 😂 le LG G6 (équivalent du Galaxy S8) en reconditionné se trouve à 80 € sur des sites comme Cdiscount et croyez moi c'est la meilleure affaire à moins de 100 euros, ce téléphone aujourd'hui est toujours performant et joli 😁
HVDK6nu5VE0;j'ai le Mi9t depuis un mois et j'en suis super satisfait. une tuerie
HVDK6nu5VE0;Classement juste 👍🏼👍🏼 impeccable
HVDK6nu5VE0;J'ai le mi 9t il est trop bien

Mui7h5HPspg;They could add a headphone jack
Mui7h5HPspg;I still use a 1980s cell phone. Cant use it for too long without my nose bleeding but it works fine
Mui7h5HPspg;Aren't you worried Paramount is going to copy-strike you for using all that Sonic movie footage?
Mui7h5HPspg;New on Alternate History Hub: What if smart phones never existed
Mui7h5HPspg;Samsung: USE PENCIL ON PHONE
Mui7h5HPspg;Apple: BUY THE EXACT PHONE YOU HAVE BUT WORSE FOR $1000
Mui7h5HPspg;Microsoft: please purchase a windows phone. PLEASE
Mui7h5HPspg;What scares me is this could prompt manufacturers to put the practice of planned obsolecence into overdrive
Mui7h5HPspg;damn people want 5G and gigabit wifi and i still have 77 KB/s wifi
Mui7h5HPspg;Thank you Vladimir Lenin for teaching about smartphones
Mui7h5HPspg;Tyler, I could've lived a good long life without all that Sanic in my eyeballs.
Mui7h5HPspg;One Word: Holograms
Mui7h5HPspg;I want holograms to be used in some smart and innovating way.
Mui7h5HPspg;we need a holographic phone which cannot be seen by the others and controled by the mind... duuh...
Mui7h5HPspg;Archival footage from 2007 of an Apple Desktop attempting to run Crysis 1 at 0:05.
Mui7h5HPspg;Remember those old Nokia's that were made of titanium plastic? I miss those days
Mui7h5HPspg;I Just want more battery
Mui7h5HPspg;The age of being excited for new phones will soon be over. But, the age of exciting advancements in VR, I believe at least, will follow
Mui7h5HPspg;"""You can play full-scale AAA games."""
Mui7h5HPspg;picture of crudely-drawn Pikachu
Mui7h5HPspg;@2:40 removable batteries. I have an Lg G5, probably the most recent flagship-ish phone with a removable battery
Mui7h5HPspg;I tried to buy a cheap Nokia phone today. The salesman kept bringing up the galaxy s10 and he kept trying to add it to my phone plan. When I told him I just want a cheap phone for making calls, he looks at me as if I committed a war crime. This cycle happened for a good 10 minutes until I gave up and walked out.
Mui7h5HPspg;Phones will get bigger and bigger until we’re back to room sized
Mui7h5HPspg;Instead of focusing on cameras, I'd like them to focus on storage capacity. It's rather annoying that apps keep getting bigger by the day but, the storage space for said apps remains the same.
Mui7h5HPspg;Well, they need to jump to 8k screens for those cheap VR headsets.
Mui7h5HPspg;The other issue with 5G is that the only companies that currently sell 5G equipment are essentially Chinese Communist Party (CCP) extensions and given it’s history of general untrustworthiness... I don’t see that being an acceptable source anytime soon.
Mui7h5HPspg;"I miss the good old days. Does anyone else remember ""Irritated Birds"" ?"
Mui7h5HPspg;*Sniff*, such a classic...
Mui7h5HPspg;I had a nice chuckle when I saw Google + icon scroll by when he mentions “social media”. RIP. 7:23
Mui7h5HPspg;2:40 this morning my dad dropped his iPhone 6 into his coffee, somehow, and just bought an iPhone 10r. Same type of thing I guess.
Mui7h5HPspg;i know why they removed the headphone jack! so they can reintroduce it as a new feature!
Mui7h5HPspg;I hope bottom bezels don't go away. I actually like having a physical home button at the bottom of my screen. I feel like less and less Android phones are having that.
Mui7h5HPspg;Smartphone development is slowing down for various reasons and, in my opinion, that is a good thing. The VCR was around for two decades without the tech evolving much and became a reliable go to device.
Mui7h5HPspg;"Not everyone enjoys completely relearning and getting accustomed to ""break out"" amazing technology every three to five years. It's disrupting to say the least."
Mui7h5HPspg;I still have an iPhone 6s Plus
Mui7h5HPspg;It performs well, no slowdown, great camera
Mui7h5HPspg;And I refuse to give up the headphone jack
Mui7h5HPspg;Problem with this video is that he is trying to predict innovations before they even happen, which is very difficult to do. People would say the same thing when talking about flip phones being the height of convenience, and boom smart phones
Mui7h5HPspg;"Take a shot everytime Cody says ""we'll get to that, we'll touch on that later, ect."""
Mui7h5HPspg;You glossed over overheating and battery life, but I'd say those are the two biggest issues facing phones right now. They're horrendously inefficient, requiring regular recharging, and the overheating issues cause phones to wear out and break faster. You know the incessant memes of sending an email on an iPhone and losing 10% of your battery, and things like that.
Mui7h5HPspg;How can you not mention the rise of AI in smartphones?
Mui7h5HPspg;My phone must be nearing 10 years old, I bought it new and still does everything I need it too
Mui7h5HPspg;Well you kinda said the same thing over and over again
Mui7h5HPspg;I was thinking about this today. It doesn't seem like phones can improve as fast as they have in the past.
Mui7h5HPspg;I like how the style of the animation has diverged from AltHistHub!
Mui7h5HPspg;kudos, Tyler, Cody & Jimmy!
Mui7h5HPspg;Xiaomi and Oppo both revealed prototype phones with under-display selfie cameras about 2 days ago
Mui7h5HPspg;Hey, don't forget about bloatware.
Mui7h5HPspg;We can't have a power efficient phone without more bloatware.
Mui7h5HPspg;"1950s: ""we will have flying cars in the future."""
Mui7h5HPspg;"2019: ""We will have flying phones in the future."""
Mui7h5HPspg;You know what I'd like? Is someone to at least attempt to create holographic displays, nothing too flashy but just something. I'd dig it
Mui7h5HPspg;Five years ago, when I was still in highschool, I used to dream about how the future would look like in 30 years. I have come to the conclusion that it will not be as different as I once thought.
Mui7h5HPspg;"Literally was just thinking ""I hope knowledge Hub uploads a video soon"""
Mui7h5HPspg;0:21 Warsaw in the background, yeah!
Mui7h5HPspg;Holographic Tech is probably the next massive thing but that might take a decade or more to become mainstream
Mui7h5HPspg;Imagine AirPods in 20 years from now.
Mui7h5HPspg;"Hasn't Moore's law been ""coming to an end"" for years? When will the end actually happen? Can someone sk00l me on dis"
Mui7h5HPspg;Turn the music down in future episodes pls
Mui7h5HPspg;On today’s episode of Lenin Explains we get to hear about how long until Smartphones stop getting better.
Mui7h5HPspg;"""Instant access to all the information the world's greatest minds have compiled"""
Mui7h5HPspg;My Galaxy Note 4 works perfectly fine, and I can replace it's battery myself.  There's no reason for me to replace it.
Mui7h5HPspg;Besides, it's CPU is good enough, it's screen is good enough, and has a micro SD card capability up to 256 gb.
Mui7h5HPspg;They could improve the audio quality when you're Actually Calling someone
Mui7h5HPspg;I’ll take a longer battery life and quicker charging.
Mui7h5HPspg;"heck , id take a foldable ""smart""flipphone, if the screen would LAST"
Mui7h5HPspg;Phone repair industry is thriving. I replaced my USB port and got a new battery for $150 including labor. Its like buying a new phone and everything still works on it a year later.
Mui7h5HPspg;They will literally get linked to our brains
Mui7h5HPspg;Our phones are smart, smarter than smartphones. Arirang phones, the best phone that money can buy
Mui7h5HPspg;iPhones need longer battery life again ASAP.
Mui7h5HPspg;How to improve Smartphones?
Mui7h5HPspg;Well, getting rid of the corporate censorship would be a step forward!
Mui7h5HPspg;They could try modular devices again.
Mui7h5HPspg;Fun fact: The iPhone 6 was the first foldable phone.
Mui7h5HPspg;So smartphone tech has basically plateaued.
Mui7h5HPspg;Instead of using a foldable phone I’m using pic to chat on my ds
Mui7h5HPspg;VR /AR glasses will probably replace smartphones.
Mui7h5HPspg;3:50 Notch: cries in swedish
Mui7h5HPspg;When selling smartphone hardware becomes insignificant to the consumer, I can see phone manufacturers shifting to software as a service to maintain profitability.
Mui7h5HPspg;Imagine instead of having access to Google or Apple for free, it's now a $9.99/mon subscription. The transition will be similar to how the gaming market is now pivoting to software as a service due the decline of physical and hardware sales.
Mui7h5HPspg;I will always welcome phones that are more durable with a longer battery life and more storage. The only thing holding the modern world back is battery technology. If it wasn't for diminishing battery life most people would keep their phones longer.

Mui7h5HPspg;1984, and/or there will be a demise of corporations related to “tech.” Tim (of) Apple may have foreseen this.
Mui7h5HPspg;2:57 NO I LOVE I BEZELS
Mui7h5HPspg;When tech slows down and it always does, a breakthrough is coming it's way, and if it dosen't it stagnates and die
Mui7h5HPspg;YouTube put this in my recommendations urrrg— Wait this is pretty good!
Mui7h5HPspg;Subscribing! 💛
Mui7h5HPspg;drinking game: take a drink everytime Tyler squints his right eye
Mui7h5HPspg;they could (read as SHOULD) have more than enough memory for some apps that become more and more bloated every update
Mui7h5HPspg;In my head I compare what we've been going through, technologically speaking, to the industrial revolution.
Mui7h5HPspg;Phone tech will improve when there’s finally a battery that can take on intense tasks and last for days without standby
Mui7h5HPspg;Could it surpass metal gear?
Mui7h5HPspg;Remember 5 years ago when the Galaxy's and the LG's and the HTC's and the iPhones and Huawei's ans the OnePlus's all looked different and unique? Instead of all having notches and curved screens
Mui7h5HPspg;"""No body likes thick bezels"""
Mui7h5HPspg;Knowledge hub: phones will look same
Mui7h5HPspg;Google: hold my project ara
Mui7h5HPspg;I kinda like the idea of them converging. Converging on a Platonic near perfect form would be cool.
Mui7h5HPspg;You're living in a dream world, Neo'ledgeHub. Software doesn't get optimized over time, it always gets slower.
Mui7h5HPspg;Perhaps the future of smart phones is integration. I could see them becoming the core of a fully mobile augmented reality system using an augmented vision and haptic interface if not full cybernetics. Fans of the Mass Effect series know what I'm talking about: Omni-tools!
Mui7h5HPspg;I'm just waiting for when phones reach a point where they're just a small tube that open up into a slate of glass.
Mui7h5HPspg;I think you missed one big issue and that’s storage capacity
Mui7h5HPspg;12:29:00 AM
Mui7h5HPspg;It's granted, spelled with a D!
Mui7h5HPspg;Not granite hahahah
Mui7h5HPspg;4:10 It already does though.
Mui7h5HPspg;Music was a bit too loud.
Mui7h5HPspg;Good otherwise, keep it up.
Mui7h5HPspg;"""5G 5G 5G 5G!!!!!"""
Mui7h5HPspg;Well every single phone ad is basically “we haz gud camra”, so I guess they’ll just keep trying to make phones mini DSLRs.

Mui7h5HPspg;First you say marvel movies are going down, now you're telling me smartphones will get boring. Getting to be a real Downer knowledge hub :p
Mui7h5HPspg;Bravo, on the beautifully worded times the modern man needs to see.
Mui7h5HPspg;The future might be mostly phoneless with body integration with virtual and augmented reality and implants.
Mui7h5HPspg;I've been asking myself this same question for the past two years.
Mui7h5HPspg;Think i might upgrade my 2015 phone soonish just waiting for pixel 4
Mui7h5HPspg;I just got a oneplus 7 pro yesterday after having a pixel XL for about 3 years. I would easily still be able to use the Pixel if the battery didnt basically die.
Mui7h5HPspg;The background music is too loud. It's kinda hard to hear and understand what you are saying.
Mui7h5HPspg;A smartphone that flips like a flip phone?  Cool, that it genuinely brings me back to the mid-2000s phones.
Mui7h5HPspg;And a smartphone that opens like a tablet?  Best of both worlds!

4kYeQAcZ3mw;Austin Evans: “Not only is there a battery”
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Yes it’s good to have a battery in a phone
4kYeQAcZ3mw;“This is for obscenely rich people”
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Austin: Owns one
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I came here to feel better about my  phone
4kYeQAcZ3mw;You need a case if your phone says Doogee on the back.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;To those who actually need a cheap phone, the iPhone 5S is a good bet going for like $50 on ebay. It runs iOS 12 and can take decent photos, not bad for $50
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Edit: Agree with a lot of comments here, if you have a bit more money the iPhone SE is a much better buy as it is a lot faster. You will probably be paying a bit over ~$100 for one in good condition used, but you'll be getting a significantly more powerful device.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;2:16 whenever I walk out of the house, this is peoples reaction.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Why does the Doogee have more battery capacity than my S8 🤣👌
4kYeQAcZ3mw;"3:38 ""This just feels *ANCHIENT*"""

4kYeQAcZ3mw;Yeah, I need to upgrade...
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I just skipped that commercial after only 5 seconds just to watch LastPass commercial for 40 seconds ...
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Not too bad TBH
4kYeQAcZ3mw;My first phone had a 930Mhz Quad Core Mediatek with 512 MB RAM and a 720p display
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Then again, it ran the lastest Android Lollipop and got updated to Marshmallow (YES, A 60 $ POTATO RECEIVED A COMPLETE SOFTWARE UPDATE)

4kYeQAcZ3mw;(Ed: wrong timestamp)
4kYeQAcZ3mw;1:48 don't call battery as an accessory
4kYeQAcZ3mw;If Apple hears it they might not give it in the box

4kYeQAcZ3mw;4:06 OMG the lens flare off that screen blinded me!  You got these from a cereal box right?
4kYeQAcZ3mw;How about a comparison of smartphones in the $100-200 price range. What if I have a small budget, but not like: a buck fifty, two paperclips, and a cork?
4kYeQAcZ3mw;0:07 dayum! He just flexed so hard on us!
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Well at this price you can get an iPhone 5c or even an iPhone 5s for $50.!!! 🤷‍♂️

4kYeQAcZ3mw;"I had a Doogee X5 Pro back in 2016 when my S7 edge was stolen. I paid £60 for it and it wasn't half bad...until the screen started to fail and had streaks all over it. It had 16GB of storage, a quad core 1GHz CPU, 720p display (5""), Android 5.1 and a 2400mAh battery. It wasn't anything particularly special but it was actually very usable and while it was a plastic build, I thought it felt decent. Doogee is pretty respectable to be honest."

4kYeQAcZ3mw;that a new challenge for you. go full early 2000s. use a setup of stuff from like 2003
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Lol I laughed my ass of when he said don’t do that fast bad idea 0:40
4kYeQAcZ3mw;While I hated my Blu phone (only a backup but still) gotta give to them for the unboxing experience

4kYeQAcZ3mw;Are u on speed ?
4kYeQAcZ3mw;"3:50 i thought he took the pic of ken with that phone ;)"
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Please check out other things like hazardous bloat-ware, especially Ken xin da had some devices with software collecting your data so this video is a little bit unprofessional, a  more deep look would be nice. Even some 30k YouTubers getting this right!
4kYeQAcZ3mw;the ken phone look like xiaomi
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Please do a drop test 😁
4kYeQAcZ3mw;When 6 is still new to you

4kYeQAcZ3mw;HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY ALL FINS!!🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮
4kYeQAcZ3mw;my smart phone was $35 brand new  =3
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Hey i own all these
4kYeQAcZ3mw;1.25 says quad core processor, packaging says otherwise.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Damm you man..iam still using a 5.0.1 android
4kYeQAcZ3mw;1:24 “512 gigs of ram backed up by 8gb of storage” tf
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I'm using Redmi Note 3 with Android 6.0 from 2 years works great 👍
4kYeQAcZ3mw;What I would do: root it & install kernal Editor as well as ram expander to turn it into somewhat of a good phone.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;LastPass: never remember a password again...we got you covered
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Me: forgets LastPass password. Nice
4kYeQAcZ3mw;1:16 quad core???
4kYeQAcZ3mw;First
4kYeQAcZ3mw;that BLU A4 phone is a complete rip-off of Lenovo Vibe B(A2016)
4kYeQAcZ3mw;You failed, the TCL lx phone was out at that point.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I am glad that you are reviewing this phone
4kYeQAcZ3mw;When you already have lastpass but still have to watch the add
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Still better than Apple
4kYeQAcZ3mw;4:00 UI looks like MIUI
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Nice video bro ❤
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Its written dual core in the box n your saying its quad core 😶😶
4kYeQAcZ3mw;@austin you didn't try a sim card. The phones only work on 2G in America. I've bought all 3 for my daughter and no 3G service on any Provider I tried.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I Cant even afford these
4kYeQAcZ3mw;5:29 dab
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I'm obscenely rich
4kYeQAcZ3mw;A 62 dollar whatever phone: 3360 mah battery
4kYeQAcZ3mw;My iphone 6s: 1715 mah battery
4kYeQAcZ3mw;this sounds biased ?
4kYeQAcZ3mw;First
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I removed LastPass from my phone as it kept asking to save a password when I was typing in a chat with other people, or just filling in anything but my password. One of the most annoying apps I've ever used.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Dogee all the way !
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Samsung galaxy tab a 8.0 2017 had android 7.0.1 upgraded it to android  8.0.1 love this tablet so much
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Watching on a Galaxy S10
4kYeQAcZ3mw;This is why I don’t like Austin because he’s always making fun of those who can’t afford higher end phones.  That’s probably why he even made this video.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;I'm getting a j5 pro
4kYeQAcZ3mw;"The first one ""with the new android 6.0"" honestly could be worse"
4kYeQAcZ3mw;My Huawei y3ii runs on Android 5.1 lolipop
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Does Ken wear makeup (3:54)?
4kYeQAcZ3mw;4:34 this phone is absolutely the Same design as the redmi note 3.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Please do another how to spend XXX.xx dollars on amazon video. I love them so much, ken needs stuff for his kids
4kYeQAcZ3mw;“
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Do this vid again only buying from banggood and gearbest
4kYeQAcZ3mw;So... reviews of smartphones consist of a camera review? I've noticed this trend with a ton of YouTubers.
4kYeQAcZ3mw;The blue phone is exactly like my cousins
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Watching this on a 150 pound phone
4kYeQAcZ3mw;The ken one kinda mimics the xiaomi mi4i
4kYeQAcZ3mw;"wait... ""Ken"" Phone?"
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Ken, you made a phone?
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Guys Alcatel tcl lx $38!?!? Amazing buy for the price go check it out
4kYeQAcZ3mw;Not been on your channel before, are you always shouting?
4kYeQAcZ3mw;my phone is a blu neo x mini nearly $15
4kYeQAcZ3mw;But I like writing down my password
4kYeQAcZ3mw;4:01 I THOUGHT THE MUSIC APP WAS TIKTOK WTF

_x0mAh-6q1I;Thanks for the video. Now i can finally decide on what phone i want to buy, and that will be the Nokia 6.1 Plus. The reason why i want that one is that i want a phone that can fit in my pocket, most of these phones on your list is Above 6.0 inch. And that is too large for me. Plus the Ram and the GB Storage is great. I can put a lot of pictures and apps in it..

1lDOLdqwjGU;Managed to get a world-exclusive hands on with a pretty radical new phone today, video coming end of August - All I can say right now is... expect a massive curve - Stay tuned!
1lDOLdqwjGU;“People don’t buy crazy”
1lDOLdqwjGU;That’s the truth right there
1lDOLdqwjGU;People watch crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;People share crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;But people dont buy crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;Very very true lines
1lDOLdqwjGU;So thats why Apple is not innovative. They don't want to fail
1lDOLdqwjGU;Thank god he doesn't strech his videos. Amazing quality as always, Arun!
1lDOLdqwjGU;There is this new feature called a 3.5 mm port. It's very useful for listening to high quality music and just overall very convenient. Hopefully this feature comes to flagship smartphones soon!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yes they failed because of Jerry Rig Everything 😂😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;Again thank you for going straight into the video, no waffling on at the start.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Small but appreciated
1lDOLdqwjGU;who else thinks this guy is highly underrated?
1lDOLdqwjGU;"5:08 ""And five years later, some people are buying OnePluses over iPhones"""
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me: 😮😱
1lDOLdqwjGU;Damn your production quality 🔥💥
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well, of course the Energizer phone was bound to fail.
1lDOLdqwjGU;It’s a mid range phone with a f*cking power bank inside it 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;His voice and background gives me so much positive vibes that I forget all the bads of the day for 5 mins.
1lDOLdqwjGU;How not to fail in the smartphone business:
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Step 1) Don't remove the headphone jack;"
1lDOLdqwjGU;...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Thank you.
1lDOLdqwjGU;They are not companies they are corporations and corporations do the same whatever the product not just phones it's all about money
1lDOLdqwjGU;What's up with your weird zoom ins witj your face? 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;Haven't watched, but my hypothesis is that this video is gonna be 11/10 👌
1lDOLdqwjGU;Phones were much more diverse before iPhone and Android became the dominant OS. I don't know why. Maybe it was the lower prices.
1lDOLdqwjGU;BcZ I CaN't SeLl My KiDnEy To BuY ExPeRiMeNT....
1lDOLdqwjGU;Buying a phone is like getting married
1lDOLdqwjGU;It takes a lot of considerations
1lDOLdqwjGU;Didn’t feel so good with the multiple camera angles tbh..... that may come down to personal preferences tho anyways beautiful video as always  
1lDOLdqwjGU;: D
1lDOLdqwjGU;Fails coz they didn't reach the criteria that follows by other companies like customer satisfaction,built quality etc...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovation never fails, it takes time to develop, once it develop it is the King 👑.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why on earth other YouTubers don't talk like this topic and only review phones. This is awesome
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love how he changes the camera angle every now and then. It makes it feel like he’s talking to an audience and we’re part of it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;buy a budget phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;change within  1 year or 2 years
1lDOLdqwjGU;we don't care if you say that you are first.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Am I the only one feeling uncomfortable to watch him talking to different cameras?😖
1lDOLdqwjGU;what’s easier to fix in a few years
1lDOLdqwjGU;A high demand flagship
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arun my man this is just so amazing, how you manage to educate and inform whilst still entertaining at the same time. God bless🤗
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me: sees video uploaded 2 minutes ago.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Wow i am early
1lDOLdqwjGU;looks at views
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me:  oh
1lDOLdqwjGU;😍😍 oh my...you have the sexiest voice..
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't think the ROG Phone 2 is going to fail. It hasn't even had it's global release yet, so I think the images and voiceover in the video are a little misleading. Asus are a powerhouse in computing and gaming and have the resources to back it up.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I like that T-shirt ❤
1lDOLdqwjGU;Can you share a link or something!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because most of them are gimmicks, not actual helpful innovations.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Edit: Welp, commented to early, very nice informative video.
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:48 - 3:19 needs to be shown to ALL phone elitists
1lDOLdqwjGU;No one cares that your obscure brand has top tier specs
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why they fail:
1lDOLdqwjGU;-Cost too much
1lDOLdqwjGU;-Innovate in a way that one cares too much about.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovative smartphones are for us enthusiasts
1lDOLdqwjGU;Meanwhile
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Daily dropout-""Heyyy !!!"""
1lDOLdqwjGU;02:37:00 AM

1lDOLdqwjGU;Great points Arun, love your videos and topics you choose. Keep up the good work.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Next vid: why we need innovation over consistency in our phones
1lDOLdqwjGU;I took a risk of switching from Android to iPhone... Now I am regretting 😞
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovation has found its way towards extreme
1lDOLdqwjGU;Wow I really enjoy your content
1lDOLdqwjGU;Will be interesting to see which of these experimental phones' features are integrated into main-line phones in the future
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sir vivo nex2 is the most underrated  innovative smartphone cause you don't know also
1lDOLdqwjGU;I wish that Arun you have 10M subscribes....
1lDOLdqwjGU;Literally speaking the best Tec review...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Cuz people don't want to sell their kidneys
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love your videos of these kind. They are thoughtful and informative. Why don't you start a podcast? I'll definitely listen to it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Bro youtubers use a phone for 2 years or 2 months.. LOL😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;We use the shit outta our phones till 3-4 years 😂 even some middle class dads till 5 long years (my father's friend still using iphone 4)😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;Dude....love the way you put perspective on your findings, keep up the good work and keep uploading your videos
1lDOLdqwjGU;OMG all that camera swaps... STOP pls xD
1lDOLdqwjGU;“Consumers don’t need innovation they need compromise” - FPT
1lDOLdqwjGU;You need to podcast brother! Enjoyed listening to your insight. Thank you
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching this on an A80.
1lDOLdqwjGU;""" Peace of mind "" that is what is important for me too..! Like this vid..having something best in something is good but it's better to always get a well rounded all arounder daily driver"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Just like the ZenFone 6 is unavailable to buy in the UK 🙃
1lDOLdqwjGU;0:52 I knew that Energizer phone was a waste of time.
1lDOLdqwjGU;For the same reason, Motorola's folding smart phone will fail.
1lDOLdqwjGU;It's pretty obvious.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video, but you could do away with changing camera angles every 10 seconds, otherwise amazing content.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love the setup brother. Cheers.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Always looking forward to your content Arun. Keep it up :)
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because it is the best among all, then after sometime you get all the greatest stuff, no more innovation, people ditch it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;9 mins after being uploaded and so much comments... Good production!
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love how leveled, detailed and concise your arguments are, great job man!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Loving the new style of videos. The new camera angles were a nice touch.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I need specks that I can count on to run graphically demanding applications and other intense apps. LG V30 +
1lDOLdqwjGU;I just cameback from a shopping run then you uploaded this, amazing content as always!👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;This video made me nervous with the start showing the ROG II. I am so eager for that phone!
1lDOLdqwjGU;I bought crazy , i got the rog phone 2
1lDOLdqwjGU;And it's the best decision of my life .
1lDOLdqwjGU;You're my favorite Smartphone tech review! Always on point, Video has a lot of visuals... I just love it all!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching this on my Asus Zenfone 6. The best decision I made over the standard Oneplus 7
1lDOLdqwjGU;This is what I would say professional quality. Content improves daily. :) Thanks
1lDOLdqwjGU;That wallpaper on 4:20 is beautiful 😍 can anybody help me find that wallpaper...????
1lDOLdqwjGU;Damn Arun, quality alongside quantity🙏❤️
1lDOLdqwjGU;Waiting for my One plus 7 pro to be delivered :D
1lDOLdqwjGU;You have a serious obsession with fails 😂 love your videos keep it up 👌🤙
1lDOLdqwjGU;PhD in tech no doubt 🔥❤
1lDOLdqwjGU;Damn your production quality 🔥💥
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video by the way! Love your voice UwU ❤️
1lDOLdqwjGU;Simply amazing as always, keep it up Arun!!!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sir you are a EXCELLENT teacher
1lDOLdqwjGU;So damn true !! Great mind and great thinking from you ! Thanks for the amazing video 😍👌
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey Arun, small point. Your B roll camera should be positioned a little away from your face. And for some reason the quality looks grainier than your main camera. Otherwise though your videos rock!
1lDOLdqwjGU;@1:31 on point! You nailed that answer.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your voice is soothing ❤️🙂
1lDOLdqwjGU;I really appreciate the knowledge I get from your videos ✌️✌️✌️👌👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;When you talk about OnePlus <3 .. Proud owner of onePlus
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video! As a phone/tech reviewer YouTuber,  I believe you're underrated. I never thought I'd that idea. Thanks
1lDOLdqwjGU;watching with my ROG Phone 2... gonna say that I'm really satisfied with this. super.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love the new camera angles!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;I need this guy as my Android app
1lDOLdqwjGU;5:09 exactly me 😂😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;The energizer phone could of worked if it rounded it's back and lost some of that battery idk like 20% off
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love the dewy look every time camera zooms in. Share what moisturizer(s) you use. 👍👍👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;So you mean ROG phone 2 fails big time :( I was really excited to get one, now I have to consider other phones
1lDOLdqwjGU;Two years? I basically try to keep my phone a live and functioning as I can, meaning I do 6 years on average with a phone xD
1lDOLdqwjGU;I’m currently wearing the same T-shirt as you! Hoooray Primark! XD
1lDOLdqwjGU;cant believe I just found out about you. amazing videos. such detail.
1lDOLdqwjGU;been watching your videos for quite some time , I wish that you can integrate someway for viewer to subscribe while watching the videos. it will surely help you sir.
1lDOLdqwjGU;10PM Aug 21 2019~
1lDOLdqwjGU;Quality content as always. 😍
1lDOLdqwjGU;5:10 the turn to camera is hilarious 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;You're doing it in 4k, that's good but you should upload them in 1080p 60 fps! Just a simple suggestion cause your videos have great visualizations!
1lDOLdqwjGU;"0:12 you should've said ""gone, reduced to atoms"""
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hopefully first 🤣
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video and informative 🔥🔥🔥
1lDOLdqwjGU;02:50:00 AM
1lDOLdqwjGU;The way he said R.O.G hurt me...
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""Even an I phone""🙄🙄"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why is it that when I zoom to fill my phone's display, the end of video links get shifted down and to the right?
1lDOLdqwjGU;The thumbnail ?? I want that mobile information in my brain right now !!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Samsung has so many types and series. that's keep company safe from low, mid, and high end war.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Zenfone 6 are good inovation to keep you face out from the Stalkers😂😂😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video, this is surprisingly well thougjt
1lDOLdqwjGU;"5:11 ""Some people are buying OnePluses, head turns toward side camera over iPhones."""
1lDOLdqwjGU;That some quality head-turning for added effect right there
1lDOLdqwjGU;This legit seemed like a university lecture xD
1lDOLdqwjGU;the two camera angles is amazing. makes it more lively.....
1lDOLdqwjGU;The animations in your Videos are so good!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me sees my a80...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Also me: ha funny
1lDOLdqwjGU;OMG! Why i keep pressing the volume keys on the left on my phone to lock it. I just cant bear the truth that my phone is not te Note 10 plus 😂😂😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love from Bangladesh 😍
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love the sense here. Kudos to you! Love the shimmer on your face
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching this on my ZenFone 6 😂😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;You have ruled out the most important factor. The reason all these experimental phones flop because 90% of the average consumers are non-tech savvy persons.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm happy with my P20 Lite even after 1 year. It's  all about the user experience.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Central part of their lives 👍🏽
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching this on my brand new grom today oneplus 7 pro
1lDOLdqwjGU;Im a travel vlogger and i would love to buy that energizer phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;Amazing Video Bro And Conclusion About The Topic Best NewsGiver About Technology 🙏
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nicely explained 🔥
1lDOLdqwjGU;00:50 OMG i actually had that phone I loved it so much but then I lost it and was so sad :( I still miss it
1lDOLdqwjGU;Oofff your voice lmaoo its so soothing
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video, as always. Just avoid the shift to the side camera, it's too distracting. It might be a subjective feeling but I don't think it's worth the extra work when filming and editing.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love you channel.❤
1lDOLdqwjGU;You're so smart and awesome!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hello i am from Indonesia😍
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great well gifted voice 👍🏻

1lDOLdqwjGU;Very short & informative, excellent job!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me throughout the entire video: Talk about OnePlus, Talk about OnePlus, Talk about OnePlus
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arun: Let's talk about OnePlus.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me: YEEESSSSSSS!
1lDOLdqwjGU;0:00 yep my pixel 3 xl went quite on yt after a werk
1lDOLdqwjGU;1+1,2,3,3t,5,5t,6,6t,7,7pro together review 😁😁
1lDOLdqwjGU;Oh only know I understand how A80's camera works!!! Lol
1lDOLdqwjGU;I had trouble to imagine how it works and never watched any videos but only see pictures.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I watch crazy,
1lDOLdqwjGU;After that,
1lDOLdqwjGU;I just ignore crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;Loving the second camera angle
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love the second camera shots
1lDOLdqwjGU;That sudden camera angle change tho ! 5:11
1lDOLdqwjGU;really hit the nail on the head again with this video, well done!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great insights. Thanks man
1lDOLdqwjGU;You're the Boss!!!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Still  Huawei Mate 20 pro is my fav phone though i can't afford it 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;is it me or this video has audio issue !!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your explanations are purely based on facts, experience and logic. Awesome.....
1lDOLdqwjGU;Legend says it's impossible to get a heart from Arun
1lDOLdqwjGU;Those transitions tho 😂😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;I hope more YouTubers promote these smartphones with long term reviews.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I see you've discovered vincero
1lDOLdqwjGU;I really like your shirt..🥰🥰
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your videos are oversharpened.
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:15 felt related 😬
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yes bro Amazon is disappearing 0:10

1lDOLdqwjGU;SPOT ON Arun 👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;JL 🕊️
1lDOLdqwjGU;8/21/19 - in Pennsylvania USA
1lDOLdqwjGU;Loving the new camera angles Arun!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Just came back from school and you uploaded 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;That's an intelligent upload man. It's nice.
1lDOLdqwjGU;love the different camera angles!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ironically, I got an a80 commercial.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The lesson is, before you make a crazy innovative smartphone, make a highly competitive flagship level phone first in order to establish your brand and customer trust
1lDOLdqwjGU;Awesome as always Arun.  Your content was packed with facts and to the point.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Mrwhosetheboss: Mr , whose the boss?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me: umm me!
1lDOLdqwjGU;2nd view
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your voice and presentation is awesome...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Please don’t change camera quickly...old video style was better
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm buying crazy have you seen the S20 ultra 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;Incredible video quality 💯💯💯
1lDOLdqwjGU;Its one of the best video u ever made👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sometimes innovation can bring to the public some new technology
1lDOLdqwjGU;My cousin's still rocking a Note 3 Neo for more than 5 years...
1lDOLdqwjGU;I myself am very satisfied with my
1lDOLdqwjGU;2in1-convertible laptop and my
1lDOLdqwjGU;ELEphone S8
1lDOLdqwjGU;"(""cheap version"" of the Mi Mix, Xiaomis experimental line)"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good job. Keep them coming.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The way you talk is so soothing 😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your shirt looks fresh as hell, what brand is it from?
1lDOLdqwjGU;what about the battery fiasco with the note 7? That didn't seem to hurt the note brand..people are still clearly excited over it
1lDOLdqwjGU;4:28 SUPERSAF SPOTTED 😁
1lDOLdqwjGU;3:25 what's the name of that brand
1lDOLdqwjGU;The way you looked into the camera @ 5:00 was frickin' weird. Like you were staring into my soul.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Lol don't be scared to say OnePlus some people is buying over Samsung and Apple not just Apple. Plus Saturday I went on Asus site to check out the Zenfone 6 and guess what they was all sold out.. He talking like Zenfone 6 is doing bad.
1lDOLdqwjGU;So I would say media is the big problem when come to  innovational to shine cause every time something great pop up y'all shut down by promoting Samsung like clock work.  Instead of just keep Samsung out of the equation let other companies eat too. That's what make me think Samsung is paying or giving some type of incentives to y'all reviewers. If I can watch a tech phone reviewers with out mentioning Samsung name in a mist of a phone review that don't have nothing to do with Samsung. That will be amazing.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great ad for Samsung, enjoy ur spoils👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;Amazing video. You nailed it sir

1lDOLdqwjGU;Mrwhosetheboss: OnePlus
1lDOLdqwjGU;Google Auto Captions: WOMP BOSSES
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:50 Why didn't you mention the OnePlus 7 Pro?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I mean it is too expensive! Who want to take Risk for such High Price..
1lDOLdqwjGU;Just look at Vivo and Oppo There most of the phones don't Android 9 pie!
1lDOLdqwjGU;I bought Asus Zenfone 6(or)6z for my mom
1lDOLdqwjGU;         And Rog for myself
1lDOLdqwjGU;I am crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching it on asus 6z
1lDOLdqwjGU;Start a podcast man!
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love the zenfone 6
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""I want something easy and reliable that I KNOW works well."" - this is why people love Apple devices."
1lDOLdqwjGU;I want to know best camera phone upto now
1lDOLdqwjGU;Air power 🤣
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:48 🤔 It's also got a 3.5mm socket.
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:09 I thought the bald guy is Johnny sin
1lDOLdqwjGU;But didn't the asus zenfone 6 succeed?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good that u recognize meizu
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well explained bro

1lDOLdqwjGU;BTW commenting before viewing coz i know when Arun post its gonna be lit
1lDOLdqwjGU;Will i get A heart please?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I just bought the asus ZenFone 6 🙃
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well then, I guess we'll see how the Pixel 4 does?
1lDOLdqwjGU;hmmmm….. I have a asus zenfone 6 :(
1lDOLdqwjGU;MKBHD subscribed ✅
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arun, I gotta say....
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your becoming Handsome and Smarter Day by Day...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Wait but isnt oneplus a sub brand of the company owning Oppo and Vivo?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nice topic for a video. Informative and enjoyable.
1lDOLdqwjGU;@Mrwhosetheboss - speaking of the Asus Zenfone 6, how is it coming along? I had considered picking one up but need to have the US bands both for city and rural as well as LTE. I gave two phone numbers and would like to make some YouTube videos but on a budget. My second choice is the LG G8 as there is also pro-mode on that camera and it does pretty decent videos (4K) but not sure the call quality is up to par. Samsung has prices itself out of my range and honestly not sure the value is there any more.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I use iphone I upgrade after 5 years of ios finishes 😃
1lDOLdqwjGU;Like the multiple camera angles
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good job 👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;I still use a flip phone with 480p screen video😐
1lDOLdqwjGU;Make a mi 9t pro review
1lDOLdqwjGU;Im finally on time
1lDOLdqwjGU;Now what to comment
1lDOLdqwjGU;I bought an OnePlus 7 pro over iPhone XR... So OnePlus all the way!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:36 what phone is that?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Pls do unboxing of realme 5 pro. Pls. Thanks
1lDOLdqwjGU;i love mr who's the boss
1lDOLdqwjGU;No headphone jack is so innovative apple
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Jon Prosser from FPT said it better : ""The market doesn't need innovations. They need compromises."""
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nice reviews for all smartphones...
1lDOLdqwjGU;That 2nd camera almost makes him look like Hasan Minhaj
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well people don't buy crazy but they sure are crazy...
1lDOLdqwjGU;The iPhone XR actually sells...
1lDOLdqwjGU;The Oneplus 7 pro and the Galaxy s10e are at the same price with triple the value.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The mi 9t is half the price with more value.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I like your contents very much. Your creations are different from the others very uniquely, just not a mere summary of the  infos available everywhere else. You analyze the information, put your own insights. Keep up the good work.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Truly Great Quality Content.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hats off to MrWhoistheBoss 👏👏👏❤️
1lDOLdqwjGU;All the video said is: Use your brains 🤣
1lDOLdqwjGU;The Pixel 3a being the most important smartphone of 2k19 proves that
1lDOLdqwjGU;Let’s set this clear. I’m an Apple fan. As we all know Apple after jobs death is not innovative. That is because Apple, the largest company has many people believe in them and it has great expectations. Innovation is very risky, especially for Apple, because they launch iPhones once a year and if they fail they are going to lose a lot of possession. They have to wait for the next year. Things aren’t as we all thing guys. From the other side of the coin we have Samsung for example. Samsung launches products very often and if one fails , no problem. They count on their other products.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey 👋 could I get that one plus one
1lDOLdqwjGU;YouTube I'll karanam Anu paranju nadakunaa anaa onu support chayuu plzz
1lDOLdqwjGU;Honestly bruh you say smart stuffs
1lDOLdqwjGU;"That's why I've waited to ""join"" the ""bezelless"" designs, I wanted something refined, and got that with the S10+, but the trend was going for more then a year before it was even revealed... I need something reliable, so indeed: people don't buy crazy..."
1lDOLdqwjGU;133
1lDOLdqwjGU;You mentioned OnePlus and it's two developers when actually they were always part of Oppo which is a sub-brand of BBK. They could afford to experiment, they just chose a good way to do it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;P.S. Writing this on OnePlus One.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Dat oili boi skin tho.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good work,very well said
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:36 Click bait
1lDOLdqwjGU;53 Views and 115 likes... Is youtube drunk again?!
1lDOLdqwjGU;I have the same shirt 😂 u shop at primark
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love OnePlus best software on Android
1lDOLdqwjGU;Please make a video on Oneplus X in 2019
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love your content
1lDOLdqwjGU;#True
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""People don't buy crazy"""
1lDOLdqwjGU;That sums up the whole video
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hello on time today
1lDOLdqwjGU;Uwow.. Im early this time baahaghaha
1lDOLdqwjGU;Very well said 👏 👏
1lDOLdqwjGU;Damn you sound like a huge smartphone company owners
1lDOLdqwjGU;You're right, I'm buying OnePlus over any other brand.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I also like Google pixel series.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""Some people are buying OnePlus' over iPhones"""
1lDOLdqwjGU;...How did he know that?
1lDOLdqwjGU;He look handsome actually when video closed up to his face...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Is it aaron or arun? I've always been confused about it.🤔
1lDOLdqwjGU;Isn't it due to this innovation mobile phones are getting better?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video BTW
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well I do prefer you just talking straight to one camera instead of two. Just my opinion tho :v
1lDOLdqwjGU;90 Hz display...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ineffective*
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey Boss, I'm one of your subscribers that watched  every of your video. I just observed your collection of smartphones and jelous about it favoring that can I have one of your smartphone that you don't use? I just want a better gaming phone than my current 20USD phone☺️❤️❤️.
1lDOLdqwjGU;True phone reviewer.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ill buy rog 2 over iphone n samsung bcus im pubg player
1lDOLdqwjGU;100% true analysis Brother. I bought zenfone 6 and it went dead in a month only.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I would love to have a Handphone that I only need to charge once a week.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Apple's truly innovation is the Apple price!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Mr who's the boss can you look at the bold n1 for a review
1lDOLdqwjGU;Is it worth it to buy the ROG 2?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Bruh. I have my iPhone 7 Plus for almost 3 years
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nice watch, man
1lDOLdqwjGU;The more optional innovative smartphones the company makes (like Samsung) the more likely they are to fail.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Very well said!
1lDOLdqwjGU;There's so much treble in your video mate.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Youre like a disney prince ❤
1lDOLdqwjGU;"5:30.... Did I heard.... ""Thanks for not watching""....?"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Or is it just my imagination
1lDOLdqwjGU;cut the price down.. innovation will work
1lDOLdqwjGU;I've got a 3D camera and I really miss the 3D screen from my phone, and because the logic and incompetence of the buyers it is really hard to buy a phone which supports 3D.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Coz it's expensive
1lDOLdqwjGU;I genuinely appreciate this kind of videos. Shows how much thinking goes into marketing and boy is it an intelligent way of thinking.
1lDOLdqwjGU;wow, the idea to make this video is incredibly good.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Spam 0:00
1lDOLdqwjGU;It is so satisfying
1lDOLdqwjGU;Let me begin by thanking you for another great review. Brownlee's reviews have become too commercial and lack real depth market analysis which you do like a champ. Keep them coming mate
1lDOLdqwjGU;That camera shift at 0:32
1lDOLdqwjGU;You just screwed Asus 😆
1lDOLdqwjGU;He watches all the cameras at the same time
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think pop up is this year's inovation
1lDOLdqwjGU;one word explanation
1lDOLdqwjGU;i love my oneplus
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm quite early here this time!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Can you give me your rog phone 2....
1lDOLdqwjGU;What phone is that in the thumbnail of this video
1lDOLdqwjGU;thanks for the clear indication of smart phones, I PREFER note 10.+
1lDOLdqwjGU;BeSt videos keep it on
1lDOLdqwjGU;You: why am I not using the Asus rog 2?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Me: cuz you're stupid
1lDOLdqwjGU;bro were u from
1lDOLdqwjGU;Osm video brother 😘😘
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think you look sweaty in these videos. It's probably a lighting issue. It doesn't change my viewing experience or anything like that, just thought it was odd.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Exactly what i have to say.... When spending money to buy a smart phone like a Huge investment that loss.
1lDOLdqwjGU;All facts 💯
1lDOLdqwjGU;Im early boi
1lDOLdqwjGU;I always go for something unusual my last phone was a Samsung galaxy note edge and my new 1 is a mi mix 3
1lDOLdqwjGU;RED are the biggest scammers in tech lol. Nice thumbnail
1lDOLdqwjGU;Analyzing the market like an engineer. Well done sir.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I paid attention to your video and let me bring back when Nokia was the king of phones and was some models has crazy has it could be.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well I guess foldable phone failed
1lDOLdqwjGU;what's up with that 200x zoom on your face with the second camera? 😁😁😁
1lDOLdqwjGU;I use a phone until a) it breaks b) it cant make calls c) its laggy beyond use d) battery exchange is not reasonable
1lDOLdqwjGU;You should review the Samsung Galaxy A20e
1lDOLdqwjGU;Cool give me the Asus ROG phone 2 please thanks
1lDOLdqwjGU;Also you can buy cases that expand the battery 1:30
1lDOLdqwjGU;Can't wait to see that new phone at the end of August.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Those rog are awesome
1lDOLdqwjGU;Haha ikr. Always go like that
1lDOLdqwjGU;oof ma boi spittin truth right there
1lDOLdqwjGU;Consistently good content Arun, both tech enthusiasts and the tech novice can enjoy your content. Keep it up, cheers from Australia 🇦🇺
1lDOLdqwjGU;What did he say 🤔🤔
1lDOLdqwjGU;A quality video.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good analysis. Agree completely with the point about risk for the buyer.👌
1lDOLdqwjGU;
1lDOLdqwjGU;No way I would buy that for 11k
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ok I’m here.. I bought 7 pro 😍 over ‘I’
1lDOLdqwjGU;a quality video as usual great job
1lDOLdqwjGU;I still own the Sony Xperia Play (loved seeing it pop up) and I absolutely loved it. It had a lot wrong with it, but it did such a good job of nailing its gimmick. I'm all about LG now though, they just give me every feature I want. Faster software updates would be nice but I can forgive them for that because I love the products! I've liked the look of the ROG2 but I feel like the camera is going to be a compromise that doesn't outweigh the gimmick
1lDOLdqwjGU;Mrwhosetheboss, I am very much impressed by your presentation, knowledge concern and ofcourse the suggestions made by you or rather I should say we can make our decision concern. So thank you very much for your videos. One personal question... Your good name please and from where you  are?
1lDOLdqwjGU;.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Any giveaway?
1lDOLdqwjGU;please make a Q&A
1lDOLdqwjGU;Bro i bought asus 6z :( did i do something wrong?
1lDOLdqwjGU;My phones last 5 years lol
1lDOLdqwjGU;You explained excellently
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ur videos are the best!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Man you have a good physique
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think you've missed a point, although it's related to the 'big name/off sub-brand' point.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Virtually nobody puts down cash for a phone.  Does it happen?  Sometimes, yeah.  Is it normal?  Or frequent?  Not even close.  Most people get a phone from their provider, and virtually all providers bill these days.  A new, innovative phone from Xaomi?  Try finding that one at the Verizon store.
1lDOLdqwjGU;That's y I bought the OnePlus 7 instead of the OnePlus 7 pro.
1lDOLdqwjGU;My favorite U 🧪 Channel
1lDOLdqwjGU;The new camera angle made me close the video
1lDOLdqwjGU;Dude turn on the AC
1lDOLdqwjGU;I actually had an iPhone XS 256GB and went for the OnePlus 7Pro 5G. Soooo much better
1lDOLdqwjGU;Who got K20 pro ad before the video 😂😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;I totally agree with you, Arun. You've spoken my mind.
1lDOLdqwjGU;U put everything very easy and understanding i like that and u give us good knowledge that we need
1lDOLdqwjGU;When you know innovations need to pay attention to the mass consumer's pocket, that's the real market penetration, not marketing campaign nor expensive investments.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I wonder if i should go for rog 2 now!
1lDOLdqwjGU;So he's saying Rog 2 failed huh?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I mean they sold a ton in China and when is yet to be sold internationally
1lDOLdqwjGU;So it didn't exactly fail right?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well, now that you said it. It makes sense. Although I am still on my Huawei P30 Pro and will be cause I have exactly two years to pay it of. It is interesting to see comparisons from such a big range of phones. In 100 of those crazy phone there might be a few that will be seen as future of phones, it is good to have diversity in that sense.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Please 2160p60 :3
1lDOLdqwjGU;Can you try vivo iqoo neo?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey Brother make a video - On How Motorola ruined by Lenevo 😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arun plz review samsung A series because i want to buy my new mobile.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Massively appreciate your work bro you are doing great.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm watching your videos since 2017 nd i never missed a single video.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love watching your videos your eiditing is fantastic or your pics nd I'm loving your videos from pakistan.
1lDOLdqwjGU;A WOW video.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hello bro

1lDOLdqwjGU;brilliant research...you made a good point
1lDOLdqwjGU;18,000 battery ummmn
1lDOLdqwjGU;good job on the cuts. they look good. but place the camera a bit far from yourselves. it will massively improve the effort you put in for those cuts.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey boss...turn your air conditioning on mate...my s10 plus really shows ur perspiration
1lDOLdqwjGU;I like the new thing aruns doing by turning to a second more zoomed in camera to transition for a new point or to emphasise what he's saying more
1lDOLdqwjGU;Boss is right 😁
1lDOLdqwjGU;873rd
1lDOLdqwjGU;Im expecting for the holographic phone to appear here
1lDOLdqwjGU;Most smartest  cutest intelligent youtuber.  My fav tamilan who famous across the world.. great boy
1lDOLdqwjGU;0:50 Wow, that's the PlayStation Xperia phone, so good to see it here. But it wasn't released tho.
1lDOLdqwjGU;What's the device in the thumbnail called?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I bought a oneplus over an iphone😅😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;Which is the phone on this video's cover photo
1lDOLdqwjGU;Bro I am using S9 but I want to keep a small but smart phone also under $200--$300
1lDOLdqwjGU;nailed it
1lDOLdqwjGU;Does this sound like science?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Price!!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm still switching to Asus Rog 2 from oneplus 7 pro once the global version release because I'm not satisfied with the performance in terms of gaming, battery tends to drain faster, the curved display sucks and annoying..
1lDOLdqwjGU;This was a great exploration of this topic.
1lDOLdqwjGU;What is the phone at 2.36?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yupp people dont buy crazy phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Crazy price ? Xiaomi redmi k20 pro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love you bro
1lDOLdqwjGU;I Love S10 and Its My dream Phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I still has iphone 6plus and 7 plus
1lDOLdqwjGU;Wow that explains many things. Next time I’ll show this video to IceUniverse when he says Samsung or any big boy smartphone manufacturers are being conservative.
1lDOLdqwjGU;>Innovation
1lDOLdqwjGU;>No headphone jack and lower resolution screen
1lDOLdqwjGU;I dont even know why I'm subscribed since we dont get all these high end devices in south Africa,  6gbram is max, MAYBE its coz i love the way you explain .  I have been tring to get red magic3 camo 12gb but i cannot even tried buying online but no shipping to south Africa, QUESTION: Is there a restriction on high end devices for south Africa?
1lDOLdqwjGU;TBH Asus > OnePlus (Copycat company)
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nice and true lines,
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""People watch crazy"
1lDOLdqwjGU;People share crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;But people don't buy crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;""""
1lDOLdqwjGU;These different camera angles are great!
1lDOLdqwjGU;We want more quality youtubers like him.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Is this RED PHONE 2?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching this with my Royal flex pie
1lDOLdqwjGU;Unbox the realme 5( 140 usd).  four camera 5000 mAh battery. sd 665
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hello?
1lDOLdqwjGU;"So, moral of the story is ""be good enough""."
1lDOLdqwjGU;It's always a risk when buying a new device cuz you're going to be stuck with it for two years so it better be good.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I use a Samsung Galaxy S8 & I am very happy with it =D
1lDOLdqwjGU;This is depressing
1lDOLdqwjGU;because we literally made the best phone design thanks to apple when they announced the iphone, the most perfectly made phone, at this point, we are basically just making this first gen iphone better
1lDOLdqwjGU;What is this second camera angle? I find it off-putting.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Is there any Ali who's early?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nice bro
1lDOLdqwjGU;I am still waiting for the phone who can cook for me.
1lDOLdqwjGU;2 years ago... I designed a phone with a camera that flips up exactly like the asus zen phone and am barely finding out that they used the exact same design (exept mine was side ways) damn it!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sooooo should I be Happy having my OnePlus 6 for not being crazy ??
1lDOLdqwjGU;Btw only that sadly crazy is that sd845 is old :(
1lDOLdqwjGU;You should open a new company... 😅 You have a clear idea what user needs
1lDOLdqwjGU;dahh we love circus but ain't doing that
1lDOLdqwjGU;I have jad this phone for four years Help
1lDOLdqwjGU;U mean to say Asus ROG 2 is a flop?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Two things: 1) really nice production. I like the way you're trying to add more cinematic quality to your vids.  2) crazy does sell but not necessarily in the device it first appeared in. A lot of what goes into a phone is inspired not just by in-house innovation but by the competition. In my opinion folding phones haven't failed. They just haven't taken off, as yet. Once they do, everybody will be cranking them out.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Each n every videos of ur....just awsome......👌👌👌
1lDOLdqwjGU;Make phone like pc , can upgrade ram , processor , camera and display .
1lDOLdqwjGU;LG: What do you mean?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Wtf 666 comment im 667
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yeah..........
1lDOLdqwjGU;Phones are not as expensive as FOOD lol 🤣🤣
1lDOLdqwjGU;This man should make his own phone series or hold a conference to advise those CRAZY smart phone companies
1lDOLdqwjGU;"I really like how you're moving away from unboxings and ""top 10 apps"" reviews and doing more high quality opinion pieces. You're actually letting your audience know what you think about a subject they care about rather than being a shill for the latest product. Keep it up."
1lDOLdqwjGU;Talk about well-rounded the S10 5g is rounded!😄
1lDOLdqwjGU;best tech guy out ther hands down
1lDOLdqwjGU;The camera switch needs to stop lol
1lDOLdqwjGU;which phone is best by performance, durability and camera among one plus 7 pr0, p30pro, s10 pro and k20pro..... plzzzzz tell me
1lDOLdqwjGU;i guess energizer phone with 18k mAh battery best for mobile hotspot on the go...😊
1lDOLdqwjGU;the camera angle and zoom keeps changing every 2 seconds. it's quite annoying tbh
1lDOLdqwjGU;25th
1lDOLdqwjGU;Never this fast
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey, don't turn around so frequently
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yes I am agree with you
1lDOLdqwjGU;Approved.
1lDOLdqwjGU;and here i am watching with my asus zenforce 6. i guess i buy crazy if we take your word as a fact.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I bought OnePlus 7 pro over s10 plus
1lDOLdqwjGU;INNOVATIVE = TRYHARD
1lDOLdqwjGU;you are unable explain why the most Innovative Smartphones fail.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video content as always, but I'm not a huge fan of the constant jumps to a zoomed-in shot of your face whenever you finish a sentence. Perhaps try additional angles or using less zoom?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Quality wise best channel.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Dude, you are properly earning a spot in the UK scene. I can't think of anyone to compete with you around here.
1lDOLdqwjGU;your videos are way exceptional than the others. I don't judge channel by subscribers and my personal opinion is you are way better than many overrated tech tubers these days. Loved your videos 😍
1lDOLdqwjGU;Someone hire this dude for there marketing department
1lDOLdqwjGU;It is all about price and what you get from it. GOOD User experience is based more and more on software, instead of hardwares. New stuffs usually have a lot of software bugs.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Supersaf behind on the right 4:28
1lDOLdqwjGU;Aron theres no neeed to wear makeup
1lDOLdqwjGU;But Rog 2 is successful in China, no?
1lDOLdqwjGU;4:50 hey that my phone, and love it😍😍
1lDOLdqwjGU;Except the software 😂😂😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;Atleast 2 years? Every phone i owned i kept for atleast 4 years. And every time i regret buying a new one because the prices increases to much compared to my monthly income :/
1lDOLdqwjGU;First
1lDOLdqwjGU;Imagine being an internationally operating brand with a revenue of billions, and then you beg for a million dollars to make a phone on indiegogo
1lDOLdqwjGU;YouTube is drunk 2 views and 42 likes
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nokia 9 Pure Views
1lDOLdqwjGU;Asus Zenfone 6
1lDOLdqwjGU;Rog Phone 2
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nubia Redmagic 3 etc
1lDOLdqwjGU;Awesome
1lDOLdqwjGU;Cause too expensive
1lDOLdqwjGU;Straight Fact
1lDOLdqwjGU;You are completely right..I took a risk and it cost me a lot and now I'm upset and so depressed
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because they're expensive, that is
1lDOLdqwjGU;When will you do a Galaxy Note 10 Battery Test?
1lDOLdqwjGU;That's why the basic phones are always the best
1lDOLdqwjGU;Pin my comment
1lDOLdqwjGU;Wise words
1lDOLdqwjGU;Lol, so inovation and progress comes from small time businesses not big time, lol
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm currently thinking about getting a new phone. The S10+ or Oneplus 7(T) plus. In 256 od 512GB what do you think
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why is the zenfone with them? Its great
1lDOLdqwjGU;I can't find where to buy a Zenfone6  -- and I don't know if it will work on my network. But, I haven't given up.
1lDOLdqwjGU;First 10min
1lDOLdqwjGU;If the Asus Rog phone 2 is sold easily with the whole console package, I would have snatched it in a heartbeat. Indonesia here.
1lDOLdqwjGU;For samsung i would love to see them launch phones every 2 years instead of  every years since they would likely last 2 years or longer without any issues
1lDOLdqwjGU;Agreed !!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video
1lDOLdqwjGU;👍
1lDOLdqwjGU;Great video
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sustained performance vs burst high performance
1lDOLdqwjGU;It’s painful to listen to someone confuse novelty with innovation so many times in one video. I couldn’t even finish. You’ll want to look up “innoveracy”.
1lDOLdqwjGU;2:37 what phone is that??!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;R.I.P. iPhone
1lDOLdqwjGU;I really want rog2 but u know ...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Its just me and emmm can i get 1 piece of your flagship mobile because i always watch your videos .
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hoping your kind to me.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Have a good day and thank u 😉
1lDOLdqwjGU;I buy crazy...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Is changing phone from Huawei Nova 4 to Mi 9t worth it?
1lDOLdqwjGU;That weird zooming towards your face and then you look at the camera, it feels like you're some sort of anchor man or something delivering the news
1lDOLdqwjGU;Although, I have to point out that marketing plays a key role here and the ROG Phone II and Zenfone 6 aren't crazy phones. They are well rounded flagships with very different demographics
1lDOLdqwjGU;This is soooo true
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey tambi
1lDOLdqwjGU;Still using my Galaxy Note 3 with Note 7 software. Apart from the camera still happy with device 7 years later.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Maybe you should make your own phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;realme phones are best and less price too durability support updates all are the best #realme
1lDOLdqwjGU;This is also one of the reasons why its hard to shift from ios to android. The risk of using a less secure os and something youre not used too is hard. Change is always the problem and people just don't naturally like change.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love your videos
1lDOLdqwjGU;I LOVE these crazy phones, but I can't afford to shell out 1000, so I have to stick with a phone I can make payments on.  How many people are in the same boat?
1lDOLdqwjGU;One plus is backed by vivo.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love  you and your videos Arun as they're always so polished but the glances to the side camera are a little contrived and don't quite mesh somehow...sorry.  Perhaps dial it back a little? 💖😍
1lDOLdqwjGU;pls do a charging test and battery drain test
1lDOLdqwjGU;pls do a charging test and battery drain test
1lDOLdqwjGU;pls do a charging test and battery drain test
1lDOLdqwjGU;You need some face wipes.
1lDOLdqwjGU;100% true.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well said
1lDOLdqwjGU;Really straight video
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arun:
1lDOLdqwjGU;I want to know who said the phone needs to last at least two years ?   That is a CRAPPLE trait and B.S. ?  We should be able to buy a phone and it last for practically forever !!!!   That 2 year stuff has been shoved down consumers proverbial throat and SCREW APPLE for doing it ❕❕❕
1lDOLdqwjGU;good info arun
1lDOLdqwjGU;You know what would sell like hell?
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Replaceable batteries, heavy duty cases, hundreds of GB instead of cloud bs, and ""only"" up to date processor power would have to be modern."
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't need a bendable Tupperware lid.
1lDOLdqwjGU;ZTE axon M. Just throwing that out there...
1lDOLdqwjGU;It was so cool in my opinion and I'm still going to buy it some day
1lDOLdqwjGU;
1lDOLdqwjGU;I had Ulefone Power 5 for about 1 year and it is my all tim favorite phone . But I was sick of the low narow-angled camera and so I recently switched to Huawei mate 20Pro.
1lDOLdqwjGU;If there was a phone that is thick, durable, lastsa week with a single charge AND has a good camera that would be the ultimate  phone for me. No curved screen, no notch, no ugly cases cause of the class back. The Ulefone Power 5 with some Huawei camera would be great.
1lDOLdqwjGU;But how does apple experiment ???
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey Arun, can you please give me a phone? You got a lot lol
1lDOLdqwjGU;You don't have enough experience in business to know. Please try to be less Tech Altar and aim more for MrMobile - both doing better at what they do.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nokia was once so innovative they failed. I remember the most ridiculous and outrageous design choices of their phones ever released.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Be it life or finance, people tend to play safe. And that's when they stop growing
1lDOLdqwjGU;well apparently a lot of people bought the rog2
1lDOLdqwjGU;u should try build a phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;Wrong Arun
1lDOLdqwjGU;Uravrgconsumer buys all the phones out there
1lDOLdqwjGU;Lg's down fall was that they inovated the smartphone industry
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your second camera angle feels wierd..
1lDOLdqwjGU;So where's the ROG2 phone?? Is it cancelled?? I wanted to buy it!
1lDOLdqwjGU;That's where the A series comes in for Samsung I guess.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not loving the new camera angles
1lDOLdqwjGU;Please give Hindi in captions
1lDOLdqwjGU;I would totally buy he ROG phone 2 if I had the money
1lDOLdqwjGU;why does everything he say seem to be obvious to me??
1lDOLdqwjGU;If samsung/ apple would do a 18 000 mah battery phone, i'd buy it. I didn't buy the 18 000 mah phone cuz it was a chinese phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;sort of like that  Huawei Camera under screen that was meant to be announced on 17th - Oct. and nothing
1lDOLdqwjGU;People don't buy crazy? The world ain't ready for me bro😆😭
1lDOLdqwjGU;Can you please talk about Huawei  mate 20pro  problems. Like the green Grinch or the green box that denies us access to anything in the phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;Still, it's good, that companies are trying to impress, IMHO.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Also, iPhone really was a crazy phone in those days. And it was a success.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Consumers pick real innovation like 64 Bit Processors,  Touch ID, Face ID, Wide Angle Cameras .... not a Flipping Camera
1lDOLdqwjGU;I only hear of crazy smartphones in videos like this, but in my country, netherlands, thereis nothing. No ads, no phones in the stores
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arun is a great speaker
1lDOLdqwjGU;*EVERY OTHER TECH YOUTUBER -- NOTE 10
1lDOLdqwjGU;MRWHOSETHEBOSS -- SMARTPHONE FAILS*
1lDOLdqwjGU;This guy copied your entire concept  of video
1lDOLdqwjGU;https://youtu.be/8fM3SjInZ2U
1lDOLdqwjGU;Right I tried different phones news from no popular brands. Like essential phone.xiaomi. umidigi. I Stick Whit one plus . I tried also pixel phones an I rather prefer OnePlus
1lDOLdqwjGU;I have Redmi Note 7 Pro, and trust me guys this phone is on another level, for 300+ this phone is amazing
1lDOLdqwjGU;Camera angles kinda weird the side one
1lDOLdqwjGU;Means i was playing safe from the year 2013😂😂😂 ahh i was not buying crazy😅😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sony Xperia p
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sony Xperia ion
1lDOLdqwjGU;Samsung galaxy s3
1lDOLdqwjGU;
1lDOLdqwjGU;onepluses... over... iphones
1lDOLdqwjGU;Right view using Samsung Note 10+ + New Sound feature?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yet Xiaomi is innovative.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Bro it's actually a bit distracting when you change the camera angle every now and then.... Just putting it out😬😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;Phone blocks anyone?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yup
1lDOLdqwjGU;I would choose a oneplus over an iphone any day
1lDOLdqwjGU;It should be real life mostly used Crazy features may be. Like the camera by 6z or a80.
1lDOLdqwjGU;https://youtu.be/R6C1VrXCr_s
1lDOLdqwjGU;Don't think ROG2 will fail tho
1lDOLdqwjGU;TBH, my s10 plus takes better photos than my p30 pro. despite crazy zoom and night mode :(
1lDOLdqwjGU;But the asus rog phone  2 is pretty successful
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because Jerry Riggs everything
1lDOLdqwjGU;I agree with your video here, but if the Asus ROG Phone 2 is more durable, or at least not as fragile as the first one, I will buy crazy this time around!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your graphics team!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watched video without reading comments. Was this video that crazy?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I like the statement that people love crazy, people like sharing but people don’t buy crazy things😀
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sponsored by s10 5G. He forgot to mention.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Smart people buy smartphones
1lDOLdqwjGU;Crazy people buy crazy phones 😦
1lDOLdqwjGU;stop using another camera angle,it looks weird, but very informative video
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well said
1lDOLdqwjGU;Man i would say a person uses their phone for 3 years at least i think 2 years is too quick to switch and expensive
1lDOLdqwjGU;hi u should use the use the iphone again
1lDOLdqwjGU;As Jon Prosser from Front Page Tech said,
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""The industry doesn’t need innovation, it needs compromise."""
1lDOLdqwjGU;The only phone I cared about in this video was the Asus ROG 2.  He hinted at something happening to it.  Did they decide not to put it out for sale or what?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Some one tell me where to buy rog  2 i not able to see on internet
1lDOLdqwjGU;Huawei is still in the news
1lDOLdqwjGU;This posh guy didn't perform very well at English did he?
1lDOLdqwjGU;so true I was lil afraid before buying oneplus 5 one and a half year back , this phone is still amaze me , gonna buy oneplus 7t when my 5 dies , although I dont think it will die soon , dropped in dirty water , had to wash it then , but after putting it 4 hrs in sun light after that its working as good as new , fall off almost 100 times still no problem at all
1lDOLdqwjGU;I just buy the oneplus 7 pro over an iphone xs max and the samsung galaxy s10+.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I just love it soo much💘💘💘
1lDOLdqwjGU;That's Asus gaming phone is a beast I would upgrade to that phone if sprint supports it
1lDOLdqwjGU;ROG phone didn't disappear anywhere
1lDOLdqwjGU;2 years ? Lol.
1lDOLdqwjGU;My old samsung s4 mini is 5 years old.
1lDOLdqwjGU;More so than actually commenting on the content, I'll shake things up a bit by commenting on
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm loving the dynamic changes to the focus on the cameras, such as changes in camera POV and zooming in. Problem I saw was that the patterns seemed repetitive so it might be a good idea to randomize the patterns or in some cases, drop a camera halfway through the video. What I mean is that fully ignore one camera at some point in the video so it doesn't look too repetitive.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm probably the last
1lDOLdqwjGU;READ ME PLEASE can you please give were you found that animated wallpaper (4:20) that are you using in every video! I'm searching it desperately!
1lDOLdqwjGU;stick to one camera angle please
1lDOLdqwjGU;This is gonna sound strange but just listening to Aaron's voice is like the best part of a video 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;When Sony and Ericsson got seperated... That day innovation leaves the mobile industry... Mainly in Design Department.
1lDOLdqwjGU;bro advertisement is the hero....who  spends how much and how long ,affects...
1lDOLdqwjGU;pls dont cut so much...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Lots of.truth but.you forgot.the most important: When you anouncing a phone, dont make it available a year after!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;A nice one.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think this all can be pretty neatly summed up in a few sentences: the costlier something is the less creative and innovative people can afford to go with it. As mobile devices became more and more important part of people's everyday lives they became a more and more pivotal business for the companies to make them - in short: going wrong with mobile devices have been becoming a more and more expensive mistake for both the producers and the consumers. The more you can lose the less you are taking chances - and being creative and innovative is taking chances.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Still Rog 2 is great, Note 10 same as note 9.
1lDOLdqwjGU;And also People only attract by camera
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ya so true, that's the reason note series n s series are perfect without much change
1lDOLdqwjGU;OnePlus 7 pro is a phenomenal device. Live to use it and it is getting better over time.
1lDOLdqwjGU;It's weird how hwawei does soo many innovations. Yet they succeed.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Any news on poco f2?😑
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""People buying one plus'es over iPhones"""
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't see what bad in that decision, Apple is extremely bad now
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not loving the new camera angles.....plus the top of your head isn't clearly visible
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not sure about the camera angle change all the time.....🤨
1lDOLdqwjGU;oneplus is damn smart and persistent..  from a company.. like I clearly remember the time when no one knew oneplus, even tech enthusiasts like me we just aware of this new company, but with invite system and all that... and now even my parents know and trust oneplus...  and every time they fail, oneplus 2, oneplus x, 2 consecutive fails in the second year of the company, 3 phones in total with the last 2 completely ignored by the masses. they struck back like crazy with the oneplus 3 and 3T being massive hit.. they had another misstep oneplus 5. then they struck back with 5t, 6,6t now they're a little bit new in proper premium segment so they made a mistake with the 7 Pro... the 7 is decent but they focussed too much on the pro, so the 7 got no redesign no new features and even didn't launch in many countries.. so lets see how they get over this..
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because the media hates new concepts
1lDOLdqwjGU;Last for two years? Uh, i use an old android phone thats still running android kitkat, and a new phone will still serve the same purpose as the phone im currently using so i dont upgrade until this phone breaks
1lDOLdqwjGU;because they aint cutting edge
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovative Phones:CURSE OF VANISHING
1lDOLdqwjGU;Mrwhoosetheboss is the boss of YouTube's tech community
1lDOLdqwjGU;They tryna be crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;I used to watch unbox therapy regularly before n later i got so irritated with his talking n unsubscribed....today i saw this fellows one video and now its the second  video ,n i can tell absolutely gorgeous....he didnt expand his video throu unwanted talking......even last video about 100k$ phone also he made it in limited video ,so thats the plus point i am seeing that unbox therapy...keep continue bro.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Zenfone 6 was quite a success tho, it was priced well. And if we look at IDC/SA stats, Huawei P30/pro duo were selling better, than S10/S10+ or Xs/Xs max duo.
1lDOLdqwjGU;It is not always, that innovations are failing.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The best feature and Design phone does'nt exist!
1lDOLdqwjGU;A phone with!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Screen like samsung!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Features like redmi!
1lDOLdqwjGU;When's that note 10 and 10+ battery test?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I just hope the ROG phone doesn't die !
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because Apple isn't doing it. Change my mind.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovation without consumer preferences in mind will never sell.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Crazy phones are great, but they come out too expensive...
1lDOLdqwjGU;I have a oneplus 7 pro and I don't regret buying this
1lDOLdqwjGU;Entrepreneurs wants innovative products while customers biggest interest is practicality and efficient price
1lDOLdqwjGU;OK GOOGLE!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;However technology has to evolve.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Some have to take risks. Makers and buyers.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Otherwise we'll return to the caves where we began from.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The likes are from Apple
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hence why I bought the iPhone XR lol ticks all the right boxes and much more without gimmicky features that could ruin the experience down the line.
1lDOLdqwjGU;MR WHOSETHE BOSS. UR a  very knowledgeable guy i watch all your videos and yes it actually make sense...love and support
1lDOLdqwjGU;New companies don't want to prove themselves. I'm really proud of the essential phone even though the original plan was to sale a high-end expensive phone. The camera is terrible and the battery life is just okay but I really enjoy the quick updates. If they can make a camera that beats the pixel then it will be worth a luxury price
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching this on my OnePlus 6T.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Def didn't consider an iPhone before a Motorola, Huawei, even Samsung. I went with ""bang for my buck""option.  I'm very happy with my decision."
1lDOLdqwjGU;I bought a OnePlus over an iPhone while i was an Apple Sheep till my last iPhone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I totally agree. I have wanted several of those crazy phones but never bought them. Instead I went with the one plus 7 pro. It does quite well for me.
1lDOLdqwjGU;makes sense
1lDOLdqwjGU;Did anyone else just feel smarter watching this?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Gone for flagship...😒still using s7 edge,becouse no money to buy any new models...
1lDOLdqwjGU;7
1lDOLdqwjGU;My phone is 4year old
1lDOLdqwjGU;Very nice 5 min video.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yeah true
1lDOLdqwjGU;I guess they are impractical
1lDOLdqwjGU;"YouTuber: let's add stuff to see why those things fail; common sense, common sense and let's not forget the biggest thing: common. Ducking. Sense."
1lDOLdqwjGU;Viewer: aha. So it's common sense!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Somehow I dislike each of your videos more. The colors are looking completly unnatural to me..dark parts have no details. Its somehow tiring to watch your videos...but thats a shame because I like the content.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""No reason to ruin a good thing"""
1lDOLdqwjGU;And that's what Samsung did this year with ugly camera cutouts, removing headphone jack and habe too many models of the phones. Will skip Samsung this time. Hope they improve nect year again🙈
1lDOLdqwjGU;In the nicest way possible... please stop looking down your 2nd camera
1lDOLdqwjGU;changing of camera angles is superb
1lDOLdqwjGU;Im watching this with my ancient galaxy note edge. with ancient 3.5m headphone jack and ancient replaceable battery.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Mkbhd: For most informative smartphone reviews and camera comparisons
1lDOLdqwjGU;Linus: Smartphone reviews with a difference and a prominent personal touch
1lDOLdqwjGU;Am I wrong or did you just showed us an Xperia Play phone????? I loved that phone so much!! Please do a video about it even just for reminiscing sake
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because they don't have the budget to pay big youtuber
1lDOLdqwjGU;The start-ups should take tips from the chinese companies like Xiaomi, Oppo, oneplus. They rarely try any crazy gimmicks=. They just bump up the price, lower the specs and not only get crazy media attention but also sales from people who wanted flagship features like latest processor or triple camera set-up on a budget.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arunn can you tell me if you use a case and a screen protector for your phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;Thinking of buying a new phone......which one do you suggest Note 10+, ROG phone 2 or should I wait for some time??
1lDOLdqwjGU;But crazy things lead to the innovation.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Arun bro. dont do that camera angle.. idk it gives me cringe. maybe its just me
1lDOLdqwjGU;I remember when Sony did 960 fps slomo and everyone call this feature a gimmick, but then SAMSUNG did it and now it's a feature. I guess thats another reason why companies plays safe.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nice vid
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm all in for crazy innovations as long as they improve the experience. Not ruin it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;No way i'm buying that heavy and bulky 18000mAh phone or that terrible holo display. that's a gimmick . But,  I'd totally buy 100 megapixel phones, swivel cams, popup, etc because they improve the experience.
1lDOLdqwjGU;you forgot apple, apple users usually using their phone for more than 2 years, like iphone 6, there are dozens of people still using that
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovation is dead
1lDOLdqwjGU;"People won't buy the ""new things"" until apple has done it!"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hi
1lDOLdqwjGU;What happened to Samsung Galaxy J series
1lDOLdqwjGU;Samsung can actually afford to do anything on their phones. They have the money and resources. They have the sheer volume. They have the market share.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'd get one but I'd have to know it's also durable and reliable if not then no
1lDOLdqwjGU;I love testing but if I can't trust it I won't get it
1lDOLdqwjGU;I like innovative phones. See that energizer 18k mah phone. I do plan to have one eventhough its bigger than your bank account. Its just that it wasnt pushed due to lack of support. What bothers me actually is that most radical phones are expensive. This binds me to practical ones which me, mom and my dog would surely love
1lDOLdqwjGU;Crazy phones scares experimented user money
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think they fail coz it's dangerous to use such products as they might break or something bad might Happen to consumer or ....
1lDOLdqwjGU;We don't need such innovation in 2019 and we like simplicity
1lDOLdqwjGU;Can I plz get a phone 😂 bc I only got a iPod and it’s soo. Bad
1lDOLdqwjGU;In simple terms if the phone's selling point is based on a single innovative concept then risk of it failing is more. But if that single innovative concept is not pivotal but supplemented by other good things then it could succeed.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Asus: we are proud to present you the best phone that you will surely crave for
1lDOLdqwjGU;Also Asus: it will not be available in stores
1lDOLdqwjGU;Then tell me why Note 10 remove the headphone jack...
1lDOLdqwjGU;I have a blackshark 2 and will stay with that brand as long as they keep doing what they are, I don't want an all round phone and I don't think companies should make there phones the same as the main brands to get more sales.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ok but aron should make a phone of his own already
1lDOLdqwjGU;Belive it or not he's just spitting straight facts right now
1lDOLdqwjGU;People dont buy crazy👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻thumbs up for that
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well like u said one of the reason one plus succeed because of their pricing, seriously as someone who can only afford mid range phone I'm forever can't buy or be first adopter of innovative phones because of their crazy high pricing..
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think you shouldn't keep the other camera angle more than 2 seconds, or it may start seeming akward.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Whats the latest on the Rog phone 2? i see its shown in this video but its gone quiet?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Oh no
1lDOLdqwjGU;Main reason is their Poor software and lack of costumer satisfaction 🙄
1lDOLdqwjGU;"The most abused and misunderstood word in tech is ""innovative"". I don't think that word means what they think it means..."
1lDOLdqwjGU;People buy apple products because the features are very polished and work so good.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ppl talk crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;Says they are crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;Want to be crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;But they don't live crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;Donate me a phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;your face looks oily
1lDOLdqwjGU;Plain and simple
1lDOLdqwjGU;They fail because people (including myseld) would rather buy samsung or iphone with out even considering the other companies
1lDOLdqwjGU;All I want is a 7” Samsung Note phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey bud......where is yout android apps videos???? Its been a long time to see that type of video.... Reply
1lDOLdqwjGU;Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ ki unboxing kb aayrgii?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hi
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hi
1lDOLdqwjGU;I buy Asus Zenfone AR 2017 still use today, sad is Google kill Tango aps,  that worse
1lDOLdqwjGU;Dear algebra dont ask us to find your X she will never come back.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Dont ask us Y
1lDOLdqwjGU;I can't watch this video bcoz of internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir.
1lDOLdqwjGU;i might stop building a phone that can flush toilet in a distance.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think if more start up companies were focus on the software side instead of hardware they can get further ahead. For me what may me pay attention to OnePlus when I was looking for a new phone was their oxygen OS and how many people rave about it in reviews.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The wisdom in this video is unbelievable all phone companies should see this video
1lDOLdqwjGU;Also tnx for getting  straight to the point
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovative phones don't work but they sure as hell becomes a stepping stone towards next gen tech thus the name experimental
1lDOLdqwjGU;Watching on my Zenfone 6
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm crazy❤️
1lDOLdqwjGU;#DefyOrfinary😎
1lDOLdqwjGU;What about the time Samsung introduced the edge screen idea with the new Samsung edge phone to test the waters. When this phone succeeded and had sales far above expectations Samsung decided to bring it to the S lineup and today it's one of the S phones most iconic features.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I can totally relate! I really want to try a Chinese phone vevo or maybe Huawei... but it’s sure to be a two month headache trying to set it up how I like!
1lDOLdqwjGU;i could listen to this man talk gibberish for an hour straight without realising its gibberish.
1lDOLdqwjGU;someone show this to the ASUS ROG people.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I want that battery phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Country name city name
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hi Arun, care to share what makes choose using the S10 5G rather than P30 Pro in details?
1lDOLdqwjGU;It’s a proven fact that nobody wants to jump in first and regret, so as much as people may seem excited about a new idea, they will always play it safe
1lDOLdqwjGU;Just think you should use some make up for you to not look soo oily. But the videos are all great .
1lDOLdqwjGU;The asus rog phone 2 at the beginning is not a great example
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hi
1lDOLdqwjGU;Didn't like the side camera, keep it straight
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don’t want to buy gimmicks I want a product of true value.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Meanwhile here I am still waiting for a god damn Xperia play 2 -_-  I used Sony since 2012 and was forced to move to Xiaomi this year since Sony started slacking hard !!! They are slowly but surely becoming another Samsung and Apple .
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think the AC is off
1lDOLdqwjGU;But apple isnt innovative and its failing in sales
1lDOLdqwjGU;who disliked dont have brain😥😥
1lDOLdqwjGU;U covered a very good topic. All we need is jus a gud phone..
1lDOLdqwjGU;Which perfectly explains why LG is struggling so hard, it's because they were experimenting too much with their main flagship lines...It gave people a strong sense of inconsistency, which undermined their trust and comfort and familiarity in the brand...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well said.  I agree totally.  The only other issue with Samsung is they always do try new tech on the A series but it never seems to make it to the S series.   It can't all be bad can it?   Lol. Great Vid.  👍🏻
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yeah of course
1lDOLdqwjGU;Food doesn't cost us 800$ or more
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why am I only finding this in 2016
1lDOLdqwjGU;What do you think about the OnePlus 7 Pro? Did you consider using that over the S10 Plus 5G?
1lDOLdqwjGU;so true
1lDOLdqwjGU;This video makes a lot of sense . . . too much sense . . . this will end . . . badly.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Oneplus 7 pro is best smartphone on the planet right now.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Some people are buying OnePlus over iPhones.... Hi I'm one of them
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because u r a Samsung fan boy
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nice video
1lDOLdqwjGU;One thing you are misunderstanding is all of these innovative inventions that fail is what makes technology grow. Without any mistakes and ideas there will be no new tech
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't see Razer failing at all. Theres a second one and I bet there will be soon another. Its design is by far one of the best if not the best of all offered phones  since 2017.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Still looking amazing. Offering incredible power, battery, amazing display, great camera and the design is making every tech geek wet.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I loved my old Sony phone but even I realized that all the accessories from third parties were created mainly for 2 brands. Apple and Samsung. I have Samsung now and had no real problems finding a case for it but Sony....
1lDOLdqwjGU;All of these children in the chat screaming first lol no one cares go to school
1lDOLdqwjGU;A J1 2016 is an example of a innovative (screen only on a budget phone) done right and wrong. Right as it had an OLED, Wrong as it had only 480P, but a perfect battery life. Oh pro tip: charge your phone around 40% to 80%, the wear level of the battery will be less worn
1lDOLdqwjGU;The camera switch isn't satisfying to watch
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because innovative isn't synonymous with useful, and the technology behind cutting edge phones is often not mature enough to be reliable.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good job I did not understand a single word
1lDOLdqwjGU;which phone is that it looks like red phone with dslr camera sensor
1lDOLdqwjGU;🧐😫
1lDOLdqwjGU;This video is 72% lol.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Soo asus rog 2 mobile is not worth or woeth? Because @mrwhosetheboss im buy the phone yesterday brother if you can tell me that?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think Huawei do innovation correctly. Get the camera to as high a level as possible. Once they keep to battery life to a certain standard, that focus alone will win it a lot of fans.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey man don't do this two camera angle thing this does not feel good
1lDOLdqwjGU;This is WAAAAAY over edited. It reminds me of poorly shot action movies where every half second there's a cut for no reason other than to I guess not keep the viewer 'bored'?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Very correctly said
1lDOLdqwjGU;Right
1lDOLdqwjGU;Started to feel Apple was right all the time by polishing their OS over time and giving incremental upgrade every single time.
1lDOLdqwjGU;BUT
1lDOLdqwjGU;average consumer cares about price per product justified with the spec sheet.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nokia joins the chat
1lDOLdqwjGU;Please the extra camera angle is distracting . I like the original camera setup .
1lDOLdqwjGU;Anyone else find the sudden cuts to the side camera a bit unsettling?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Very good video. My mobile is my office. Reliability matters the most and so many phones develop problems or like my Galaxy S 2 years ago just shut down never to wake up again.
1lDOLdqwjGU;What would you do?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I dont see any problems with iPhone xs
1lDOLdqwjGU;People only care about the camera, run smooth on games, good battery life, bigger screen, thats it
1lDOLdqwjGU;I guess not having a long term vision is also something which plays a significant part....... Not everyone can be Elon Musk
1lDOLdqwjGU;Now I know why iPhone gets new features later than others cause they test and upgrades it.most people outside us,uk,eu uses iPhone more than 4 years cause they are expensive.
1lDOLdqwjGU;If u don't use your rog 2 and wanna give away... Im able to any gifts
1lDOLdqwjGU;hi boss
1lDOLdqwjGU;I personally like the way Samsung handled this back in 2013-2014 when they released the Galaxy Curve & Note Edge. The Curve didn't do so well in its limited run, but the Edge showed promise, so they made its key feature (a curved screen edge) a permanent part of their lineup. Nowadays, it's practically the defining trait of a Samsung: a big, beautiful, edge-to-edge display.
1lDOLdqwjGU;People share crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;People watch crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;But people buy Nokia 3310
1lDOLdqwjGU;That’s truth.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Asus ROG Phone 2? I can't even get a Asus ZenFone 6 in Malaysia market
1lDOLdqwjGU;Agreed
1lDOLdqwjGU;Zenfone 6 was a huge success.
1lDOLdqwjGU;OnePlus is the best
1lDOLdqwjGU;True, even Huawei is still seen as ,,Chinese'' brand, even though they manufacture premium products.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Or...... people dont have enough money to buy those phones..😅
1lDOLdqwjGU;You are completely right.I was iphone fanboy once.Then I purchased Oneplus 5t just to experience something new.From back then I never looked back to Iphone.Now I am using Oneplus 7 pro.The best phone on the market.
1lDOLdqwjGU;AGREE.
1lDOLdqwjGU;sadly agree
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why the creepy close up camera shot?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good
1lDOLdqwjGU;Good
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because Apple
1lDOLdqwjGU;They don't buy crazy bcuz it's super pricey
1lDOLdqwjGU;OnePlus is always best
1lDOLdqwjGU;That why i'm prefer using iphone than android..5 years os update..apps quality more polish in ios than android for example instgram have better quality build in apps..camera also quite good both image n video...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Many people care about what phone others see them using. They care about status
1lDOLdqwjGU;ROG phone from Asus isn't crazy, it's practical and normal.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Google assistant need tution from this man 😂😂😂😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;Here is how to innovate phones:
1lDOLdqwjGU;Make phone calls seamlessly
1lDOLdqwjGU;Improve wireless with Jack support
1lDOLdqwjGU;P30 pro is not crazy and it is selling very well.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The two camera angles are really jarring.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Nyc video
1lDOLdqwjGU;That’s exactly why people buy iphone
1lDOLdqwjGU;I guess you got wrong.
1lDOLdqwjGU;People don't buy crazy phone becuase its crazy expensive that's all.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Slap an apple logo on it, anyone who buys the $1,000 emoji machine is already crazy😒😒
1lDOLdqwjGU;1dislike for your youtube name....
1lDOLdqwjGU;I bought a Rog Phone 2 and the software just isn't as good as Samsung (YouTube glitch, keyboard too low to the bottom of the screen and no VoLTE or VoWiFi in any western country). The hardware is incredible especially the battery but the glitches may be enough for me to send it back.
1lDOLdqwjGU;To me the Asus Rog would be top mark if I could buy the phone in a less rgb like stile and with a better camera.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The video feels miserable when he doesn't say '' my name is arun and this is mrwhosetheboss '' at the end i mean that's 50% why i am watching this video.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think the best example is  LG, most of the stuff that is so common on our smartphones first appeared on LG phones. Their ideas were innovating and successful since they caught on and  yet their smartphone brand sank into anonymity.
1lDOLdqwjGU;He's just flexing his Economics knowledge in this video 😂
1lDOLdqwjGU;This kinda explains why Apple is late to a lot of new tech.
1lDOLdqwjGU;If i had the money I'd buy the rog phone it's not crazy.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Stop switching from straight angle to side angle.. you don't gain anything,  it makes people dizzy,  and we lose our focus.. other than that , we love yah...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ps.. great content,  excellent quality,  short and meaningful.. straight to the subject.. love that.. but please.. NO SIDE ANGLES..
1lDOLdqwjGU;Get the point but why put rog phone in there... its not crazyyy~
1lDOLdqwjGU;As of next year there we be nothing special about the Galaxy phone s. They are following Apple down the dark path.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Product design is a risky business, get the core design wrong, you risk everything.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I Buy crazybut Crazy is not always stable and reliable
1lDOLdqwjGU;Apple doesn't have midrange/budget phones to test on like samsung, that's why they make sure that new features are stable before putting on their phones.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I found it slightly annoying that you have a second camera for this shot. Its just a straight up review, u dont need that second camera angle.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Very interesting and quite true. Long term reliability does play an important part. In my case at least, ever since galaxy S2 I've been a samsung fan. But I bought LG g4 little after it's launch. which I liked it alot. That's until it bricked on me out of nowhere which I later found out was a common issue. That brought me back to samsung solely because of it's reliability. Though I was thinking about oneplus 7t5g after it's rumours.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I will buy asus rog 2 over s10 or note 10
1lDOLdqwjGU;More crazy the phone the higher the price become . Other phone much cheaper and have some feature they need .
1lDOLdqwjGU;Most people buy popular phone just like motobike because of repair and sparepart availability .
1lDOLdqwjGU;One thing that did succeed are popup cameras
1lDOLdqwjGU;Or do Huawei does, copy and steal tech, combine with their R&D, and It will get good product
1lDOLdqwjGU;I value your content, but don't like your new step-zooming, rapid-cut editing... just saying 😊
1lDOLdqwjGU;That's so true people don't buy crazy cause they don't wanna willing to take risks
1lDOLdqwjGU;I want to buy a rog phone the problem is i can't afford a high end one atm. I would go for it if i could for sure cause it looks like exactly eaht i want
1lDOLdqwjGU;I will say tho even if the phone was a fail it pointed out what customers do want. A big battery.  If u asked everyone if they would want a big battery or a slimmer phone they would want  a big battery. Energizer just went too far.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovation is not dead it's a continuous process.
1lDOLdqwjGU;So the right way of doing things is to not get too crazy about innovation.
1lDOLdqwjGU;i think people will buy crazy
1lDOLdqwjGU;but the main thing is price..
1lDOLdqwjGU;and service center..
1lDOLdqwjGU;No one talking about the new camera angle
1lDOLdqwjGU;Only legends know he is not making unboxing video
1lDOLdqwjGU;True said
1lDOLdqwjGU;People can and do buy crazy, but it's usually to expensive. It's all about the mid-range now.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey boss so is it safe to buy ROG phone 2,i'm really interested in buying that phone.......any problems with long term usage since you mentioned it in your video,i almost got a scare since its the first phone i am willing to buy irrespective of the price.......do tell me if you know anything.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't think switching camera angles is necessary, i know you want to emphasize something, but it just looks unnatural and kinda weird
1lDOLdqwjGU;Iterative updates, iterative updates is where its at...Next OnePlus we see or the T version of it at least will definitely have that under display camera shown off already. So yeah, we can have long term innovation but only in small jumps.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I was really willing to buy the Energizer phone because of its battery life (although they could have added a jack port). Too bad people didn't care about the project, it was really a really great idea to get a powerful battery that doesn't die after some hours of intense use we all are used to.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I have so much respect for oneplus. The only issue is theyre not on sprint...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Mrwhosetheboss: No reason to ruin a good thing.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Samsung: removes headphone jack
1lDOLdqwjGU;People watch crazy positions
1lDOLdqwjGU;People like crazy positions
1lDOLdqwjGU;But people doesn't try crazy positions 😏😏😏
1lDOLdqwjGU;Agreed n disagree with at same time
1lDOLdqwjGU;These niche phone not meant to sideline S10 nor P30 nor OP7.
1lDOLdqwjGU;These are boundary pushers.
1lDOLdqwjGU;#1. Performance
1lDOLdqwjGU;Your understantind is far far superior to the poor understastinf executives who are well paid  to do that demonstrate.
1lDOLdqwjGU;..and that's why Nokia N-Gage failed.
1lDOLdqwjGU;no one will buy a brick that cost 699 $!! i think all these features should come as a mod
1lDOLdqwjGU;You can see that Samsung is being smart as they have reserved their experiments for the a series and if the features are good enough they might have a chance to be on their a series
1lDOLdqwjGU;disease which need to be cured globally. whoever buy 2 phones in a year are the real noobs.
1lDOLdqwjGU;In terms of Zenfone6, I think it's gonna succeed. It's not too experiencive and as ASUS is popular in Asia even in Japan. It's flip system is also thoroughly useful compared with pop up camera phones and choosing the wide angle lense is with the 2019 ultra wide angle trend so it's exciting. In addition ZenUI got really clean so I'm sure many people will get satisfied with Zenfone 6.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Long story short people like to have a look at rebels but when they talk about them they don't want to be a rebel!
1lDOLdqwjGU;It's a recipe of disaster going down the line of bigger, flashier, crazier the better! for a general ideology that falls in tabooish category people are intrigued but only a very niche percentage tries!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well, another way to look at it is to say that the cell phone innovations’ field is not that volatile - it’s kinda like one huge advancement per sector per decade then forced small advancements in a single device at a time
1lDOLdqwjGU;This guy is too cocky.. He used to be good because he kept things simple without the Mr showbiz turning off now!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovations need time to develop. Everyone forget how Albert Einstein become success in bulb??
1lDOLdqwjGU;Bad innovation gets flushed out:
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not removable battery, less durable screen, remove headphone jack, remove normal USB, monopolies operativsystem, short battery life, removed garranty when repairing and overpriced
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey
1lDOLdqwjGU;i like cake
1lDOLdqwjGU;i like cake
1lDOLdqwjGU;i like cake
1lDOLdqwjGU;You mean all these foldable phones and dual screen phones are bound to fail?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Samsung's flagship @2019 is flatting or declining while their midrange are blooming.  I'm not surprise, all the gimmicky, innovation, new stuffs, testing features are all on the A series and the S series are just expensive and boring.  Isn't that tell us something?
1lDOLdqwjGU;No u
1lDOLdqwjGU;The logo of this channel is kind logo of Angela White
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think when it comes to mobiles , alot if us are stuck in a rut , so we stick to what we know & what we trust , me included , I always go for notes , because I love the stylus , & could'nt see me getting any other phone , i suppose like alot of people,  I'm comfortable with samsungs .
1lDOLdqwjGU;Srsly Arun, you production quality have sky rocketed in the last few months! (Very much comparable to MKBHD)
1lDOLdqwjGU;Keep up the good work my friend!
1lDOLdqwjGU;If you have nothing, you'll spend your everything because you don't have anything to lose.
1lDOLdqwjGU;But if you have so much things, you'll try to keep you safe.
1lDOLdqwjGU;And that's the reason of crazy low prices of some smartphones. They don't have so much so they'll try to sell with the minimum profit to just sell but once they rise they'll not be as crazy and cheap as before.
1lDOLdqwjGU;What manufacturers called 'innovation' nowadays is bring prototype products to the public even if they are not ready, add crazy features but sacrificing some more important things like durability and mobility.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Some of them do succeed.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Galaxy note series was an experiment where they just put a stylus pen inside of the ""galaxy series"". Viola, I'm using a galaxy note device!!!"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because they are gimmicks that no one in reality want or need past their glamor factor
1lDOLdqwjGU;People will beg for change, but when change happens, they choose to spend their money on the same product that they’ve seen a thousand times before.
1lDOLdqwjGU;You meant to say is reliability. Crazy phone isn't reliable enough
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hey man, but you are missing a huge aspect of this matter.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Many companies also release phones that are basically HALO PHONES
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not in any way meant to upset the existing smartphone market as it stands today, but mainly just to have that particular company have a presence in the space, even if it is not very significant
1lDOLdqwjGU;becose they are not innovative WHAT....
1lDOLdqwjGU;5 years later people are buying OnePlus over iPhone.. I'm one of them, just bought OnePlus 7 pro after selling my iPhone 8plus
1lDOLdqwjGU;PRAY for the Amazon rainforest, it burning down and I don’t even see a lot of people talking about it. The Amazon forest produces 20% of our air and 20% of our fresh water also the animals help the system go but now they are dying. Brazil president needs to do something about it!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Becus they innovate. They dont just copy paste.
1lDOLdqwjGU;the only reason phones fail is because of the launch prices, companies develope a phone and slap a huge bill on them, as a new startup this is the worse thing you can do, launch cheap, grow confidence and then tickle the price up, it's simple and effective.
1lDOLdqwjGU;but they don't do this, its all about the huge price tag they think they can get from the phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The camera change in middle is creepy af...the front one looks just fine no need to go to side angle! Just my opinion!
1lDOLdqwjGU;In the far far future, ill buy an asus rog phone because of the flat display which i like and the stereo speackers, plus its already faster then my Samsung Galaxy S8 plus exynoss version, so im exited for that kind of phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;They all failed because of JERRYRIPEVERYTING
1lDOLdqwjGU;I am one of rare people who will actually buy crazy. And yeah its sad that people dont really support experimental stuffs even if they could. Its so boring bruh
1lDOLdqwjGU;While i don't mind the ROG doesn't sell as good as other flagship, i really hope the Zenfone 6 will be a hit, Asus did so many awesome things with that phone.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Aaron, most of these companies who make these innovative devices do not have anything to lose in contrast with the better established brands. Most of the times even if the company markets it well... Most of the sales are dependent on the YouTube reviews also. If most of the YouTube reviewers say the product has more cons then the end user is not gonna buy that device. But at the same time I really appreciate the youtubers' efforts cos it makes the company think twice before putting a device in the market.
1lDOLdqwjGU;OnePlus aren't small. In truth they are just part of BBK.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Basically - is a conservative market..
1lDOLdqwjGU;Would u rather have a phone with a 1440p screen but slow performance or a phone with a 480p screen but super fast performance
1lDOLdqwjGU;One plus users hit like
1lDOLdqwjGU;Put apple logo on it and even the worst product would sell
1lDOLdqwjGU;too much innovation is bad innovation
1lDOLdqwjGU;People hate change
1lDOLdqwjGU;People hate being different.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Please S10 5G vs Note 10 plus CAMARA and battery which is better?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I always speak truth
1lDOLdqwjGU;You are really cute
1lDOLdqwjGU;Love from Pakistan
1lDOLdqwjGU;10
1lDOLdqwjGU;Completely unrelated topic but help me out. What would you get? pixel 3xl for$ 599 US or mate 20 pro for $650 US?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I really like the battery life of the mate 20 pro and the ultra wide lens, but this whole Huawei ban doesn't make me confident of getting a Huawei.
1lDOLdqwjGU;am i the only one who visits your page not because of the content but because of your voice? so hypnotizing! Bwahahaha
1lDOLdqwjGU;Rog phone 2 is not a fail..
1lDOLdqwjGU;I have to paid around RM3000 for a flagship smarphone that price was 1 month and half of my salary every month...so to paid that much price i need to make it worth  to paid...and at least it can hold for about 3 or 4 years without any problem...
1lDOLdqwjGU;So that's why Apple doesn't innovate, they don't want to fail
1lDOLdqwjGU;Because we don't deserve good things.
1lDOLdqwjGU;It's almost like phones should be modeled like software, where there's a stable build and a beta build (back when the word beta means something). There are just too many phones for people to experiment and phones r&d cost too much to just do basic innovation.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why not increase the range of your channel other than phones, like computers, etc.. That might add more spice to your channel
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't like the second camera that you turn to, it's just distracting from what you're saying. Would prefer you just talking to the same camera.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not every thing you say is true. Lock Xiaomi. And on the ather point, not taking risck exploding note.
1lDOLdqwjGU;people want long lasting phones and they will not gonna get it because that decrease sales.so most of them buy cheap phones because not gonna last anyway .
1lDOLdqwjGU;how simple is that?
1lDOLdqwjGU;People don't buy crazy coz the price is too crazy.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I guess thats why Apple never innovates. They are just playing it safe
1lDOLdqwjGU;So that means face id brought for the 1st time was not innovative? People it and bought that in high numbers as well.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Rog 2
1lDOLdqwjGU;Snapdragon 855+
1lDOLdqwjGU;120 hz of refresh rate display
1lDOLdqwjGU;Two head phone jacks
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well im first ... what now
1lDOLdqwjGU;damn 2view 13likes
1lDOLdqwjGU;Amazing
1lDOLdqwjGU;#54
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hello love youuuuuuuuu
1lDOLdqwjGU;
1lDOLdqwjGU;You are awesome
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yesssssssssss
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hello
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not first
1lDOLdqwjGU;1ST VIEW . YEAAAH
1lDOLdqwjGU;first view..
1lDOLdqwjGU;OR you could have gone for the ONEPLUS 7 PRO!
1lDOLdqwjGU;No but really, why do you use a Samsung S10 instead of the 7 Pro?
1lDOLdqwjGU;You know what's sad? On the internet no one reads paragraphs anymore. If you want replies and likes it has to be... Well not this. One or two lines and that's it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;So in other words, people are afraid to take risks because every time someone takes a risk it doesn't work and nobody buys it so every phone company becomes afraid to not be inovative.
1lDOLdqwjGU;What happened to high risk, high reward? Like seriously, I'm tired of the bog standard I want something different.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"God please.. talk to just one camera, its so overdone with those angles and zooms, it just looks really ridiculous and it's definitely not adding ""studio like experience"" to it"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovation is dead if you prefer apple
1lDOLdqwjGU;Just a dislike because you called asus rog 2 a bad phone... Please...
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think that the perfect smartphone would be one that strikes a balance between practical and crazy at the same time. Most experienced and high volume smartphone manufacturers suck as Apple and Samsung play it too safe which has resulted in stagnating growth and even declining sales while new manufacturers basically throw out practicality for gimmics and usually stupid ideas. Look at the RED Hydrogen. The display is horrendous. Then you have that 18,000 mAh battery phone. Look at that thing, it's way too thick for a regular pocket. A better idea would've been a slightly thicker phone than the usual iPhones and Samsung phones but with a replaceable battery.
1lDOLdqwjGU;In short, if your gonna go new, make sure your product is affordable with appealing design, reasonable customer service, specs that could resonate to that of flagship one's or atleast close to them at the time. The pricing is key here, it should hit the right margin where it isn't too low for the specs you offer or too high at the time. One plus went for that rather than innovation. Now, that's sad cuz this situation makes companies to throw in them spec number more and more like 8gigs of this 12gigs of that rather than making the innovative product appealing to customer's.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Is samsung a80 is worthy or not
1lDOLdqwjGU;So thats why Iphone isn't very innovative.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Hello, im a big fan but, this video is awkwardly weird, it is like watching an action movie with the unnecessary angle switching of shots, it is very annoying, i dont know if youre trying to be funny, and the right and left editing of popping phones as you mention them is ugly, it is making me dizzy, why not move your video to only one side and transition phones videos in a fade in fade out method? I love your videos but these action movieesque editing is giving a newbie feel to our videos which of course you are not but it doesnt suit your content,
1lDOLdqwjGU;Actually, in reality though it doesn't fail. Its for a small group of people like fanatics and loyalists and etc. But then, if the company can't sell more, they just kill it, thats sad.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Bro u would have got good money if you given this business strategy and statistics to some Chinese company.
1lDOLdqwjGU;its because people now choose what is simple and more usefull than over acting phones.
1lDOLdqwjGU;That’s why Iphone is still the best it’s not a crazy phone but a flagship phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm sorry again but I was dared to dislike ur video.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I trust in innovation.... without it nothing was possible in this world... innovation is the things that gives us new era new type of technology and new way to Settle the world...I always like innovation I was using zte Nubia x it's a great phone everyone amazed to see it ....
1lDOLdqwjGU;Those weird close-up jump cuts to your face over and over are a bit jarring.
1lDOLdqwjGU;One yr ago i was buy wiko u feel prime becose he hawe 4 gb ram for 200$ after half a yr battery shows frist steps to wreck i try it to find another battery but i failed becose in serbia where i live for this device you can buy onlu screen and and silicone mask nothing alse so i make big mistake with that, about others specifications when i was gaming he heat so much then i must to leave it becose i think processor was weak for that much ram so yeah that's it bye
1lDOLdqwjGU;If the world moves the way you say, than iPhone price tag would have cost a fortune and wouldn't have moved forward from iphone 1.The failed gadgets HISTORY always paved the way to FUTURE innovations (as is defined).
1lDOLdqwjGU;Apples success is a testament to the lunacy of the customers ..they want the same design , same os , same flaws to shoved down their throats over and over again , all for that overrated apple logo. This also the reason why ambitious companies fail ... Imho htc one m7 was the best design/design change in the smart phone industry
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't get it, man.
1lDOLdqwjGU;You say that Samsung has no reason to ruin a good product.
1lDOLdqwjGU;So you call those people liars on Youtube comments screaming and hyping Zenphone when it was released? I'm gonna buy this over Oneplus, bahaha. Stuff like that. I guess they never bought the phone after saying that
1lDOLdqwjGU;In my opinion, Asus really succeeded with the Zenfone 6.
1lDOLdqwjGU;They got the attention they needed on the phone market.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Now the previous Zenfones also came to minds of people that didn't know Asus really exists on the phone's market. AND they sell the Zenfone 6 like crazy! Well Done Asus!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Just an opinion, I don't like the camera switching. I mean from your face (zoomed out) to your face (zoomed in)
1lDOLdqwjGU;People want change.. but people won't change..
1lDOLdqwjGU;First
1lDOLdqwjGU;Why i only use iPhone. Understand samsung is great, maybe even better. But iPhone for me is the safe choice
1lDOLdqwjGU;Asus is not marketing as much as Samsung or other established manufacturer. I work for one of the mobile network provider. when we sell our contract with phone we would suggest the phone which provides us the most incentive. most incentives we recieve was from Samsung and huawei. Oneplus and xiaomi are exceptions because they sell near flagship phone for cheaper price with the important features that has to be flagship level or better (from my experience is oneplus offer stock android os which is better than Samsungs os. dash charging which way faster and only on recent models samsung opted to increase charging speed) and asus phone are not cheap.
1lDOLdqwjGU;my answer for you , it fated....
1lDOLdqwjGU;for example , an iphone is totally a backward technolony and super sky high pricing....
1lDOLdqwjGU; yet, it selling very well and make a lot money. ..
1lDOLdqwjGU;You don’t know how many people buy cheap phones. We’re not all rich!
1lDOLdqwjGU;Simple answer..... innovation costs money which most people doesn't have........
1lDOLdqwjGU;I agree with you in almost all aspects, except for the Asus phones: this is because Asus company has such a large quantity of product and very strong and good relations with their customers.
1lDOLdqwjGU;They can risk to be innovative and this year has shown a winning Asus year. Moreover (a least in Europe) Rogue Phone II it's a craze for gaming people. There's a long waiting list for it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Without watching the video (yet), to answer – because most ""innovative"" smartphones simply don't appeal to wider audiences."
1lDOLdqwjGU;"You can innovate a handful times in your entire company lifetime. Apple did few times, and continued to ""ride"" the innovation with incremental updates because that is what sells. Once it stops selling like hot cakes and becomes commodity, they  move on to different innovations."
1lDOLdqwjGU;K
1lDOLdqwjGU;Energizer a cell company who made a phone by putting huge batteries inside, instead why not make a battery thats much better, smaller, and last longer than others and then release a phone?
1lDOLdqwjGU;absolutely stupid title. actually innovative devices dont fail. phones with features no one needs fail
1lDOLdqwjGU;Any phone that isn't reasonably priced,  state of the art, and comes with a $100 gift card for Outback Steakhouse doesn't gain my interest. Except The ROG 2 by ASUS!
1lDOLdqwjGU;You just trying to promote the samsung trash.
1lDOLdqwjGU;1st
1lDOLdqwjGU;Innovative does not equal practical. You can put a horse tracker on a phone, but in reality not many people would use that.
1lDOLdqwjGU;This is the reason the smart phone companies are getting stuck. In order to sell with innovation they need to make it a trend, or make sure people will use the new feature. On the other hand in order to sell they need to stand out and be innovative often getting stuck in a weird loop.
1lDOLdqwjGU;two camera angles suck stop
1lDOLdqwjGU;thats the reason why copycats exist
1lDOLdqwjGU;Don't say Asus's innovation is failed  😡, zenfone 6 is good flagship phone and world fastest gaming smartphone 📱 is Asus ROG phone 2
1lDOLdqwjGU;"On one side we have all this ""crazy"" phones that noone is buying, on the other - companies like Samsung and Apple use that fact and sell us almost the same phones year after year. With prices going up, of course..."
1lDOLdqwjGU;I'm not an iphone fan but if I decide to buy one for $1100 I could sell it back 1 year from now without losing a lot. If I buy a new phone with no name and shocking features who will I sell it if I decide o really donr like it
1lDOLdqwjGU;Supersaf at 4:28
1lDOLdqwjGU;Am i the only one who recognised him because of his supersaf tee
1lDOLdqwjGU;Don't change the camera angles during talking it's annoying
1lDOLdqwjGU;i feel it's not entirely wrong to come out crazy or unique device. otherwise,  we would be getting the same iteration every year. unique or crazy phones do cater to a small demographics of people.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"""we see crazy, we like crazy, but, we dont buy crazy."""
1lDOLdqwjGU;People are buying one pluses over iphones? Who even buys iphones?
1lDOLdqwjGU;You said it. So do i dont prefer buying other samsungs than S or Note series. A or J series arw a pure experimentals for Samsung.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Come on.  You know that whole story of OnePlus is fake.  It’s a sub brand of a major company and has almost unlimited resources.  This story of two guys fighting the industry is totally fake and you know it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not sure how Samsung phones fail.. they have innovated more than anyone and still are among top 3. LG on the other hand. They did the notch, they did the wide angle lens first and boom.  They still can't sell for a damn.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Can’t you build your own phone , you know so much so you might as well do so
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well said and great quality.... you're my best tech youtuber, you don't only introduce new tech devices, you also revise some tech which is great to note keep it up ...🔥🔥🔥
1lDOLdqwjGU;Totally agree with you on the note, most people can't make mistake with their smartphone choices, as in today's world it takes up a very important place as we can complete so much work in them. Actually, agree with you in all the points, especially, If some brand wants to stay in the market for long, they have to think long term, not do something drastic, people actually don't buy crazy, especially, when it comes to so much money.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Not a fan of the weird camera angle.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The only problem why i could buy a gaming phone is that......i dont have enough money..otherwise i know what it is capable of
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Mrwhosetheboss, not sure if this has been mentioned yet - but you should read a  book called ""Loonshots"" it's recently released, and talks about why once all companies reach a certain size, they cease to innovate."
1lDOLdqwjGU;From my opinion the more process and futures do the phone while using it or when it locked the more battery drain fast and that give you between two options keep using them but charge the phone few times in one day or close most of the future's Also expensive phones that have much pixels it's the phone that has low battery life
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't see any risk going with Asus ROG phone 2. Asus typically makes  high-quality devices and provides updates for them. I don't mind the camera being not as great as the Google pixel, iPhone, or Samsung galaxy. I'm willing to make that trade when everything else about the phone is great
1lDOLdqwjGU;"i don't think people are actually interested in buying 1000$  so called ""gaming"" phone ,they can just have a decent gaming pc in that price lmao"
1lDOLdqwjGU;Let them experiment and test things out, Samsung, Huawei and Apple are reliable brands and will cover up everything that works and makes sense. Sadly, people are still buying gimmick devices and they don't even realize how bad those devices are.
1lDOLdqwjGU;There's nothing wrong with innovating but the reason the big phones got big was catering. Yes they experiment but also mostly listen to their consumers, and alot of the things that innovators are bringing detract from the biggest wants of the vast majority of consumers
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think the most innovative mobile company is SONY.....they fail only because of low marketing
1lDOLdqwjGU;..Now everybody knows that the 1st foldable smartphone is SAMSUNG FOLD....but did anyone notice that the 1st foldable tablet was already built in 2012 with the same technology that samsung is trying to make now...it was SONY TABLET P..
1lDOLdqwjGU;Thx mrwhosetheboz i got sleep disorder but somehow after watching your video i could go sleep even when im still watching your video
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sorry but that's obvious it's the only reason we watch you so that we don't buy a rubbish smartphone
1lDOLdqwjGU;I can't get why people buy Gaming Phones because the other same year phones perform the same and it doesn't give you an advantage or something but they have a worser camera and other specs
1lDOLdqwjGU;Ya but stupid people like me want to buy every single phone
1lDOLdqwjGU;"Well that's why today this market is boring, in 10 smartphones 8 are like ""twins"", even in specs they're similar. I love crazy, like Nokia with N-Gage and many others, Caterpiller phones (S61), and many others brands I don't even remember their name but who has a great phone's with different technology who you don't find in flagships."
1lDOLdqwjGU;But as a new trend we should try crazy devices once, should we or not. If you are Against it then give a like or accept this then comment( reply) in it.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Isn't the problem for any new brand that of distribution? An established physical retailer and customer support infrastructure inspires consumer confidence rather than an online presence for a new, small brand several thousand miles away.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Rog is not for general consumers, duh.. and the company is not expecting everyone to buy like Apple or Samsung. It's specifically Razer type Mobile, it's for gamers. So it's a win win for the company, I disagree with you for the first time Mr.Arun
1lDOLdqwjGU;Even if they do not succeed, innovation should go on. Even if the devices itself do not grab the user base, the features that made them stand out eventually come to the mainstream market. For example the innovative Sharp Aquos. Even if that phone didn't get enough sales, it's headline feature was taken by the Xiaomi Mi Mix, which started a trend that goes along today, Bezelless smartphones.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Well, who says we have to create crazy? All one of the big names would have to do is take their already great product, and tweak it a little bit to advance in one area. Most companies are focusing on screen to body ratio and the cameras, but how are you going to use those things all day if your battery is too small? 18,000mah is just too much, but 7,000 or 8,000 isn't. Phones today are too thin, so I don't think adding a few millimetres is going to bother anyone. Pair that with some good power management and the already great phone that we mentioned before and boom, you got something different that's not too crazy. Want a phone that will last you 3 days on a charge? Here it is, it looks just like a regular phone. That's really all it takes. :P
1lDOLdqwjGU;I UNSUBSCRIBED JUST BECAUSE OF FAKE THUMBNAIL AND IRRELEVANT TITLE AND CONTENT SHAME ON YOU
1lDOLdqwjGU;I agree but to a point. With something real crazy or gimmicky like the energizer phone it's true but some phones are made for more niche markets like smartphone gaming. Take the Asus ROG phones for example, just because they're not aimed for the average user doesn't mean they were flops if they don't sell as many units. Lastly even phones outside the norm can be successful in a mainstream market as anyone trying to buy a Zenfone 6 can attest.
1lDOLdqwjGU;You review Huawei phones? Peoples Republic of China, Tiananmen Square killers, Hong Kong killers, and you buy and review their product? Disappointed. By Chinese law, Huawei and ZTE are an arm of the Chinese military and intelligence services. I thought you were smarter. I guess not.
1lDOLdqwjGU;People don't buy the most innovative smartphones because companies like Apple and Samsung own the advertising market and all the sheeple know is basically two brands.....
1lDOLdqwjGU;If the innovation misses the mark, it will fail. The only phone with any true innovations I know that actually succeeded is the Samsung Note series, and this Note10 plus is the ultimate innovative phone in my opinion. I just tried making a 3D scan today, after the August update, it wasn't active on my phone when I got it on August 10th (had to wait for reverse wireless charging too, it's great!). SPen functionality is incredible and the camera is fantastic. There are huge improvements to it since all the reviews. Reviewers should wait for the final retail software update before reviewing cameras on new phones.
1lDOLdqwjGU;how long it takes to charge the energizer phone if it run out of battery?
1lDOLdqwjGU;I don't call them innovative, they are lazy tries on being innovative. The only innovative smartphone this far is Iphones. And they've been on the track for a while. Will probably take long until something else takes its place.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Sorry to do this everyone, but he just described in this video why liberal policies and agendas are losing to conservative measures in American politics.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Will i buy   One plus 7 or rog 2 ..... please suggest me
1lDOLdqwjGU;Most people buy on leasing and contracts. 99% of mobile operators only sell limmitted variety of devices (Samsung, Apple, Lenovo/Huawei and its Chinese sub brands like Motorola/ Pocophone/Xiaomi etc. Those phones you mentioned never reach that market plus lack of service centers...rest is just your imagination.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Crazy side products that don't sell aren't necessarily failures. There are, of course, failed devices (like the Red Phone) from people trying to break into a market. However, while there are occasional breakaway successes among crazy devices, many crazy devices aren't meant to sell at scale. A small market, low risk, platform is useful develop ideas. Sometimes you need to follow through with a design to prove it out, or decide that it's not going to work. Developers let the risk tolerant early adopter market bleed, then move the valuable, refined, features forward.
1lDOLdqwjGU;"I think the big issue is how everyone is marketing the innovative phones and features.  They have to take a page from food and ""as seen on TV"" advertising, and i don't mean annoying late night infomercials.  Take for example the Canadian Fast Food chain A&W, a classic burger chain that was a mainstay of the classic Drive In Restaurants from the 50's.  When they make a change or do something new like start offering a Beyond Beef meatless burger pattie that tastes like meat,  non-hormone treated beef, or other changes, they do an add campaign where they give out free versions of whats new, ask people what they think of it, then reveal the change so people feel comfortable with the change, not just some ad copy saying its better because we say so.  In thruth that is what those ads are and those people are probably actors, but it is the ""See its OK, the change isn't bad and you might like it"" and it works.  Infomercials do a much more exadurated version of the same thing as pitch men and women show the thing is good by using it."
1lDOLdqwjGU;People do buy crazy, but has to be useful too. The OG iPhone was crazy. A low memory iPod touch that made calls. Camera was massively subpar, no App Store. You were just buying a nice iPod interface that made calls and had 4GB memory, when my classic already had 160gb, and you could buy awful games for it. Even the nano came with 16gb flavour. To be honest for it wasn’t until the iPhone 4 when Apple made a compelling phone. Also the Samsung note was a crazy gimmick phone that now is considered normal. I think we just reached the limits of what we would really want to do with our phones. I think the tablet/laptop space is where the innovations will come hardware wise. For phones, it’s just software now.
1lDOLdqwjGU;The worst tech reviewer I have ever seen.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Most of the reviewis paid review
1lDOLdqwjGU;落😉
1lDOLdqwjGU;first!!!!!
1lDOLdqwjGU;First...
1lDOLdqwjGU;Second comment!
1lDOLdqwjGU;First comment
1lDOLdqwjGU;First comment
1lDOLdqwjGU;1st one too se
1lDOLdqwjGU;Simple answer. No one NEEDS them. Most of the consumer market are people who just want a phone. That’s why Apple is so successful. They make things that people can just use and don’t have to worry about.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Something is better than nothing.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Then there's the iPhone xr... sucks in basically every aspect but people still buy it over the galaxy s10 that's only $100 more and runs laps around even the iPhone xs max
1lDOLdqwjGU;Mainly because of Asus's customer service sucks and unlike the iPhone or Samsung they don't sell offline.
1lDOLdqwjGU;One plus is overhyped and its given too much attention for no reason even though one plus sucks - the 7th gen is out and it's overpriced the camera sucks idk why dxo rated it so high, 90hz display I don't see any use of it in a real world for a normal consumer usage, battery obviously blows evyones mind...I'd buy a Huawei or xiaomi or a Samsung over a overhyped crap like one plus period.
1lDOLdqwjGU;AUSUS are you watching?
1lDOLdqwjGU;Learn something from this guy.
1lDOLdqwjGU;I think you are wrong. It’s not about taking risks. The innovative smart phones are ugly. Thad’s the main reason people don’t buy them. A smart phone today is also an accessory that they are going to look at every day. People want a nice sleek design.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Plzz don't do that, just don't do that, are you a pyscopath, changing camera angles like that.
1lDOLdqwjGU;3:00.......  The answer is Samsung gave you the most money, let's be honest.
1lDOLdqwjGU;You guys are the ones complaining the loudest about no innovation and all phones looking the same.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Yet, here you are pushing people not to buy the innovative phones and calling them gimmicky and failures.
1lDOLdqwjGU;So true. I hate my new iPhone XR but also was not willing to change.
1lDOLdqwjGU;YouTube is drunk again 🤣
1lDOLdqwjGU;Views are 2 but the likes are 30 and in the comment section there are 9 different ppl.
1lDOLdqwjGU;Absolutely agree Arun.  Believe it or not this is the exact same reason that i love the galaxy s and note smartphones. They are not the best at anything, yet they are great at everything.

pWvSwX-jq7o;"I had smart phone addiction. I then ""upgraded"" to a flip phone with no internet. Its way cheaper ($25 a month) and well I'm not as distracted anymore."
pWvSwX-jq7o;Who else is watching on their smartphone?
pWvSwX-jq7o;This was honestly one of the greatest talks Ive ever heard - especially because he spoke about our attention spans.  I'm mad its only got 94,809 views - nobody wants to hear the truth lol its too difficult to face reality as it is
pWvSwX-jq7o;"I work from home as an internet marketer and web designer. I have 7 computer screens in front of me for 7 hours a day. When I go out, I am totally unplugged. As a matter of fact, I am proud to say  ""I don't have a mobile phone"" and I get to enjoy ""LIFE"". I'm not ""Trapped by an APP""."
pWvSwX-jq7o;North Korea have 0 phone addiction!
pWvSwX-jq7o;This is one of the reasons I got rid of most of my social media accounts. This is really the only one I have left and it is not on my phone.
pWvSwX-jq7o;I witnessed this with a former friend . He changed soon after he started using it . I thought it was my imagination.
pWvSwX-jq7o;Right 2 Disconnect - Absolutely.
pWvSwX-jq7o;This video changed my vision of all of this. I'll change my behavior
pWvSwX-jq7o;It was a week ago i tossed my smart phone.  Have a flip with 350 minutes a month FREE actually doesn't cost me a thing.  I'm ten times more focused and in the moment now then i was since i had a smart phone starting 2009. Love it!
pWvSwX-jq7o;i have not owned a phone in  2 years! i don't think i'll ever get another one!
pWvSwX-jq7o;"I find the use of the term ""Smartphone"" to be a real oxymoron, considering these devices are not smart or phones. Their actually a radio and a small computer that cannot think for its self."
pWvSwX-jq7o;Smartphone Zombies is a better term.
pWvSwX-jq7o;Thanks!!! This video is waking me up! Everyone should see this!
pWvSwX-jq7o;1:10 you can see his phone in his pocket
pWvSwX-jq7o;8 seconds? He's right! Do you know how I know? I googled it on my phone!
pWvSwX-jq7o;"""phone bad"""
pWvSwX-jq7o;Ive been talking about this for years. People not paying attention in the grosery stores and even without thier smart phones, there has been a dramtic shift in connection. Im a HSP which means i pick up on the behaviors of others.. The disconnect meaning how much more often I could hear from my babies and face to face then i do now and they live hours or days away., I cut down on my notifications, hence is the reason why there is a dnd setting in the new smart phones today. Im very mindful of the world around me and not to contrdict myself here but to put out the word that i really miss my childen in the way he talks about. .
pWvSwX-jq7o;brilliant video
pWvSwX-jq7o;Get off your phone now
pWvSwX-jq7o;throw ur phone away. ppl managed just fine before them.
pWvSwX-jq7o;Im still using my smartphone
pWvSwX-jq7o;Cellphones .... CELL (locked into and trapped )phone
pWvSwX-jq7o;I love my technology, however, I quite often miss phone calls when I'm at work, because I dont answer the phone while im at work.
pWvSwX-jq7o;(It's a figurative leash.)
pWvSwX-jq7o;7 B 😁😁😁
pWvSwX-jq7o;Dopamine
pWvSwX-jq7o;On dopamine
pWvSwX-jq7o;On dopamine
pWvSwX-jq7o;Mobile phones can be useful if not used all the time. People are being controlled by others & friends by being in contact too much by text or phone asking where they are & what are they are doing. There are too many control freaks about. Everyone needs chill out space.  People are not looking where they are going in the streets because they're looking at their phones.
pWvSwX-jq7o;like
pWvSwX-jq7o;constant notifications from facebook & instagram are driving me crazy, so i turn them off. i receive notifs whenever i log in... that's relieving. so many good points here. 👍
pWvSwX-jq7o;thumbs up if you listened to this from a smartphone :)
pWvSwX-jq7o;I love it
pWvSwX-jq7o;can someone tell me what to look up or put the link for the news report of the mother loosing her son while using her phone? I am doing a debate on the negative impacts of cell phones. Please and thank you.

pWvSwX-jq7o;I found it impossible to rid myself of my cell phone addiction. So, instead of using cell phone as an 'entertainment' and a device to distract me from doing from my work, I started to use it to study and work - as a tool that increases my productivity.

VcpS8xYec0w;Das ist eine typische Bild-Liste!!!! Absoluter Schwachsinn!
VcpS8xYec0w;Hahaha, was für eine Schwachsinns Liste
VcpS8xYec0w;Es fehlt das OnePlus 7t Pro
VcpS8xYec0w;Wer hat den Bericht gesponsert! Samsung? 😂😂😂... Das Xiaomi 9 Pro müsste drin sein😂
VcpS8xYec0w;Diese Liste ist sowas von lächerlich hahahahahaha
VcpS8xYec0w;wo bleiben die Modelle von OnePlus?
VcpS8xYec0w;Mal ein wenig über den Tellerrand zu schauen hätte der Liste gut getan...
VcpS8xYec0w;Dieses Video wurde gesponsert von: Samsung 🙄🤣
VcpS8xYec0w;4:26: die Auflösung des Mate 20 Pro bei der genannten PPI beträgt 3120 * 1440, also nicht die eingeblendeten Full HD+ Werte..
VcpS8xYec0w;schaumi fehlt!
VcpS8xYec0w;Was eine schwachsinnige Liste!
VcpS8xYec0w;Ohne ein 1+ oder redmi  ? Lasst euch weiter kaufen von Samsung und Apple . Voll Deppen...
VcpS8xYec0w;laut computer bild gibts also allover drei hersteller: huawei/samsung und apple! okey, dann fuchtelt mal weiter mit den glasbrocken rum, welche in 2 jahren auf dem technischen stand meines daily drivers sind! liebe grüße von meinem OP7TPRO.🔥
VcpS8xYec0w;Note 9 und note 10 sollen also genau gleichgut sein? Was habt ihr euch denn dabei gedacht 😂 note 10+ wäre für mich der allgemeine Gewinner dieses Jahr, einfach ein super Gesamtpaket
VcpS8xYec0w;Das S9 schießt bessere Bilder?
VcpS8xYec0w;Ich hab vor ein paar Tagen vom S9+ aufs 10+ geupgradet und finde das überhaupt nicht ^^'
VcpS8xYec0w;bin vom iPhone 8 auf das p30 pro gewechselt, muss sagen das war die beste kaufentscheidung. huawei ist einfach top, hätte ich nicht gedacht
VcpS8xYec0w;Das Xiaomi Note 10 pro ist nicht dabei
VcpS8xYec0w;(Trauer Trauer)
VcpS8xYec0w;One Plus, Xiaomi fehlen
VcpS8xYec0w;Scheinbar werden nur bekanntere Marken benannt. Und zusätzlich werden noch Modelle aus 2018 hinzugenommen.
VcpS8xYec0w;"Natürlich eine Bild-Liste. Nur die ""bekannteren"" Handy-Marken in die Liste hauen. Aber naja ist ja Bild. Btw. Platz 1 ist aktuelle wenn man nach diversen Benchmarks und gescheiten Test´s geht das ONE PLUS 7T PRO"
VcpS8xYec0w;"Wo ist das Mi Mix 3 und das Mi Mi Alpha absolut schlechte Liste ;)))) gekauft"
VcpS8xYec0w;Warum hat das Video Likes?
VcpS8xYec0w;Was ist mit dem OnePlus 7 pro ?
VcpS8xYec0w;"Was eine schwachsinnige Liste. Smartphones aus dem Vorjahr aufzählen und die Top-Liste dann ""Die besten Smartphones 2019 | deutsch"" zu nennen ist peinlich."
VcpS8xYec0w;Lächerlich :3
VcpS8xYec0w;Samsung, Apple und Huawei,Huawei, Apple und Samsung,Apple Huawei und Samsung und bla bla bla
VcpS8xYec0w;Wo bleibt das Mi 9 t pro?
VcpS8xYec0w;"Oh, Mann! Leute, ihr wisst doch, ich liebe euch, aber wie seid ihr bitte schön auf diese ""Besten""liste gekommen? Wenn das nicht zum Weinen ist, was dann? 😢"
VcpS8xYec0w;Nichts neues wer das meiste für Werbung bezahlt der gewinnt.
VcpS8xYec0w;Die Akkulaufzeiten versteh ich nicht ganz, hab ein Galaxy s10 und Akkulaufzeiten  sind einfach nur furchtbar. Die Kammera einfach nicht gut.
VcpS8xYec0w;Viel zu viel samsung
VcpS8xYec0w;Alles schrott irgend wie :)  einfach nur lächerlich  das stimmt .
VcpS8xYec0w;Da hat mein handy mit 6000 mAh länger lauf zeit  :)
VcpS8xYec0w;der Akku hält bis zu 70 stunden .
VcpS8xYec0w;Ich hab das Samsung Galaxy A40
VcpS8xYec0w;Oneplus 7t
VcpS8xYec0w;Die Liste ist meiner Meinung nicht nachvollziehbar
VcpS8xYec0w;Bin gespannt was im neuen Jahr jetzt kommt
VcpS8xYec0w;Wieviel hat Samsung euch geboten ?
VcpS8xYec0w;Wo is das Asus rog 2 un es one plus 7t
VcpS8xYec0w;Iphone 11pro kann nicht auf dem4.platz sein😠
VcpS8xYec0w;Was für ein scheiß
VcpS8xYec0w;Hallo (2019) Smartphones nicht 2018
VcpS8xYec0w;Es kommen handys vor die 1-2 jahre alt sind 🤦🏻‍♂️
VcpS8xYec0w;Und das s10 haltet nie im leben 13h ich habe  ein s10plus und bei einer dauernutzung kommen ich höchstens auf 6-7h und dann kommt ihr an mit 13h wtf😂
VcpS8xYec0w;"Voll die Kackliste, wo ist OnePlus, Xiaomi, Realme, Oppo, Motorola etc? Die bieten für weniger Geld das gleiche!!!! Typisch BILD, Kommerz ist alles ;)"
VcpS8xYec0w;Apple ahja
VcpS8xYec0w;ich würde keins davon kaufen
VcpS8xYec0w;Reupload vom 09.12
VcpS8xYec0w;Leider habt ihr ein absolutes Flaggschiff vergessen, dass OnePlus 7 Pro mit seinem großen Akku und 90 Hz Technik was  bisher kein Smartphone nur annähernd schafft o. bzw. kann, dabei 😉
VcpS8xYec0w;Es fehlt das huawei nova 5t
VcpS8xYec0w;Platz 2 is wirklich unverschämt
VcpS8xYec0w;Typisch Bild null Ahnung eins der schlechtesten Smartphone (Samsung) so oft in der Liste.
VcpS8xYec0w;11
VcpS8xYec0w;wo bleibt OnePlus
VcpS8xYec0w;Hab ein Samsung Galaxy S10+
VcpS8xYec0w;Wer sagt denn, dass das Mate 20 keine guten Bilder bei schlechtem Licht macht, wenn es bei schlechtem licht die besten macht?
VcpS8xYec0w;Für WhatsApp was 90% bestimmt alle nur nutzen. Sind alle Smartphones gut 👍😀
VcpS8xYec0w;"Wieso heißt der Titel nicht: ""Die besten Samsung/Mainstream Handys der letzten beiden Jahre""?!"
VcpS8xYec0w;Außerdem ist die Lieblingseinschätzung der Redaktion scheinbar 1,9.
VcpS8xYec0w;Hier geht es gar nicht um Preis-Leistung. Wenigstens 1 Handy zum besten Preis müsste dabei seien. Denn hier hat sich 2019 extrem viel getan.
VcpS8xYec0w;Keine Sony Xperia Smartphone's schade :(
VcpS8xYec0w;Es fehlen nämlich das Sony Xperia XZ3 Xperia 1 und das Xperia 5
VcpS8xYec0w;Lächerlich! Nur Samsung, Apple und Huawei. Wo sind Xiaomi, oneplus oder Google... Stattdessen 2018er Samsung Modelle. Zum kotzen!
VcpS8xYec0w;Das Huawei P30 Pro ist der Gewinner aus dem Jahr 2019 und ich habe es für 425 gebraucht erworben, IST DAS GEIL!
VcpS8xYec0w;yayyy huawei gewinnt
VcpS8xYec0w;Nehmen nur Handy Marken die bekannt sind was ist mit one plaus
VcpS8xYec0w;Ich finde das beste Handy ist das OnePlus 7
VcpS8xYec0w;Das ipohne 11 ist auffällig schwer
VcpS8xYec0w;Was ist mit OnePlus,Xiaomi,LG da gibt es Top Handys für einen angemessen Preis!Die gezeigten Handys sind nicht schlecht aber beim Preis völlig überzogen!!Sehr einseitige Bestenliste vor allem Samsung die schon lang nicht mehr gut sind was Handys betrifft!!
VcpS8xYec0w;Xiaomi das iphone 11 pro ist so scheisse
VcpS8xYec0w;Lächerlich, ein Note 9 über das Note 10 zu stellen.
VcpS8xYec0w;Für einige wirds wohl besser sein, wegen Persönlichen Präferenzen, aber subjektiv ist das Note 10 das besser Gerät
VcpS8xYec0w;Keine gute Liste! Zwar verständlich zu sagen das ein S9+ inzwischen ein richtiger preisleistungs Kracher ist ABER dafür ein ONEPLUS 7 pro mit 90hz Display nicht reinzunehmen ist lächerlich
VcpS8xYec0w;"S10plus gute akkulaufzeit ???😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Samsung hat dieses jahr allgemein abgeranzt gegen apple und huawei in sachen akku vorallem sind dir exynosmodelle richtig scheiße selbst das.11pro max hat das note 10plus geschlagen und hatte über 24% übrig ich will echt eure schwachsinnigen akkutests mal sehen und der größte witz ist ja ""2019"" aber gezeigt werden ein note 9 und s9plus von 2018😂😂😂 trinkt mal weniger"
VcpS8xYec0w;Wieso werden Geräte bewertet,die sich die wenigsten leisten können? Ich habe ein Galaxy A 70,und ich denke das die meisten auch Mittelklasse-Smartphones haben,man könnte doch davon eine Hitliste machen.
VcpS8xYec0w;Xiaomi??? OnePlus??? Asus??? Google??? Was für eine Scheiße!
VcpS8xYec0w;Oh man, ich kann mich da nur vielen anschließen, wenn ihr schon eine solche Liste erstellt, dann doch bitte richtig und vollständig!
VcpS8xYec0w;Und dann noch obendrein faktische Fehler einbauen, wie zum Beispiel beim Mate 20 pro mit schwachen Aufnahmen bei schlechten sichtverhältnissen! Es fehlen auch die oneplus, xiaomi und Pixel Geräte die definitiv einige andere noch übertrumpfen können. Genauso unverständlich ist es, das ein Samsung für die gute Ausdauer gelobt wird!? Hallo, seit Jahren haben diese Geräte vor allem mit dem exynos Chips massive Probleme mit dem Energie Management! Bitte für die Zukunft, wenn schon solche Listen, dann bitte nicht in 5 Minuten recherchieren und schnell abdrehen. Ach ja eines noch, es wird 3 mal auf die beste akku Laufzeit eines Gerätes hingewiesen. Einmal huawei mate 20 pro und dann nochmal huawei p30 pro. Ja halten beide wirklich ewig durch und Unterschiede sind marginal aber eben ein weiteres Beispiel. Ansonsten sehe ich eigentlich eure Beiträge recht gerne.
VcpS8xYec0w;Vor allem die kammer beim iPhone 11 pro ist gut ne das ist scheosse
VcpS8xYec0w;P30 pro hat keine Google Dienste so laienhaft
VcpS8xYec0w;Das realme x2 pro fehlt in der Liste. Xiaomi auch 🙃
VcpS8xYec0w;Die Intromusik ist viel zu laut. Habs mit Sennheiser PXC 550 II gehört. Da bekommt man ja Gehörschäden ! Zumal man nicht weiß wann die Musik immer wieder dazwischen derart überlaut eingeblendet wird. Sorry aber sowas geht ja gar nicht. Denkt doch mal an Eure Zuschauer, die mit Kopfhörern hören und hört Euch son Video mal selber an !
VcpS8xYec0w;Wie kann es sein das das Lg v50 fehlt? Dieses gerät hat features das kein anderes hat und vielleicht jeh haben wird......und trotzdem redet keiner darüber.....wie?
VcpS8xYec0w;Xiaomi, OnePlus und Asus scheinen hier kein Sponsoring zu betreiben... Oder die Redaktion ist einfach sehr eingeschränkt in ihren Wissensstand.
VcpS8xYec0w;Super Video! Perfekte Beschreibung.
VcpS8xYec0w;Huawei auf Platz 1💪
VcpS8xYec0w;Das S10 hat eine Akku Laufzeit von 13 Stunden?
VcpS8xYec0w;Wie soll das funktionieren?
VcpS8xYec0w;Ich habe ein Oneplus 7, das Gerät hat eine sehr gute Akku Laufzeit, ähnlich wie das Mate 20 Pro. Da kommt man auf eine Display on Time von ca . 6-8 Stunden mit einer Akku Ladung, ist halt abhängig was man damit macht...
VcpS8xYec0w;Jetzt mal ehrlich ich benutzte seit 6 Jahren nur Samsung aber ich finde das Iphone 11 Pro mit Abstand am besten. Klar kostet es sehr viel aber wenn man jetzt mal nur vom Top Smartphone redet hat das Iphone 11 Pro: Die beste Kamera, Das farblich beste Display.
VcpS8xYec0w;Den mit Abstand besten Prozessor.
VcpS8xYec0w;1.Warum besteht die Hälfte aus Samsung Geräten?
VcpS8xYec0w;2.Wer sich ausreichend informiert würde wissen, dass das Oneplus 7t Pro das beste Smartphone ist.
VcpS8xYec0w;Alle die sagen Schwachsinn! Es war bei der redaktion und wurde da getestet
VcpS8xYec0w;schon klar hat samsung und apple die besten smartphones. es gibt ja keine anderen hersteller, ach ja huawei ist noch neu auf dem markt 😂 löscht euch bitte und gebt das weihnachtsgeld dass ihr von samsung erhalten habt, nicht auf einmal aus 😉
VcpS8xYec0w;Waaas für ein scheiß das one plus 7t pro ist  meiner Meinung nach sogar das beste Smartphone mit dem Note 10 plus hat Samsung dich gesponsert oder was
VcpS8xYec0w;Ich hatte erst einmal ein Samsung galaxy a6. Dann bin ich auf das Samsung Note 4 umgestiegen. Danach ging dieses kaputt. Also holte ich mir ein Huawei p8 lite 2017.doch dieses ging mit 2 Jahren den Bach runter und funktionierte nicht mehr. Also holte ich mir ein galaxy a50 von Samsung. Aber mir diesem Handy war ich nicht zufrieden. Das Display ging am ersten Tag kaputt und die Leistung hat mich nicht überzeugt. Deswegen schickte ich das a50 zurück und holte mir das Samsung Galaxy s10+ mit Vertrag. Dieses Handy gefiel mir, doch ich möchte es einfach von dem System her nicht. Deshalb holte ich mir ein P30 mit Vertrag und schenkte meiner Schwester das s10+. Doch das P30 enttäuschte mich im Bereich Ausstattung. Es war z.B. nicht Wasserfest. Deswegen entschied ich mich schließlich das P30 Pro für 800€ zu kaufen. Das Handy ist sehr gut ausgestattet und gefällt mir sehr. Da ich Fotograf bin und sehr erfahren in dem Bereich Kamera usw, überraschte mich das P30 Pro mit seiner unglaublichen Handykamera. Das P30 Pro hat 8 GB RAM und 225GB ROM und sieht in der Farbe Aurora auch noch unfassbar aus. Ich finde das P30 Pro hat den ersten Platz völlig verdient. Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit meinem aktuellen Smartphone.
VcpS8xYec0w;Warum  bitteschön ist das iPhone 11 Pro Max auf Platz 3, wohingegen das 11 Pro nur auf Platz 5 kommt? Beide Geräte unterscheiden sich ausschließlich bei der Größe?!? Möchte ich also ein kompakteres Gerät, habe ich im Umkehrschluss also das schlechtere SmartPhone??
VcpS8xYec0w;Ja Xiaomi wurde  nicht genannt
VcpS8xYec0w;schon mal was von one plus gehört ??
VcpS8xYec0w;Das ist der schlachtschiff Killer besonders die Siebener Serie von one plus 7 Pro und 7 t Pro sind immer führend auch deine Nummer kommt da nicht so gut gegen an one plus gehört übrigens zu den schnellsten Smartphones der Welt einfach mal schauen was one plus alles so kann es gibt nicht nur Samsung
VcpS8xYec0w;Wo ist das Mate 30 Pro. Trotz das es offiziell Keine Google Apps hat gehört es trotzdem Definitiv in diese Liste es ist Definitiv auch Ohne Google Apps eines der Besten Smartphones des Jahres !
VcpS8xYec0w;sorry kann ich nicht gucken... der ton ist so beschissen abgemischt. sobald die musik einsetzt ises viel lauter und meiner nachbarn stehen im bett.
VcpS8xYec0w;Die Musik ist viel zu laut und die Stimmen zu leise. Das sollten Profis doch hinbekommen, oder?
VcpS8xYec0w;Leute regen sich hier ja so sehr auf über die Samsung Handys aber jetzt mal im ernst,  Bild geht immer nach Preis Leistung und man bekommt jetzt schon die s10 modelle für Preise die ihr heute noch für ein iphone 8 zahlen würdet. Es geht immer um Preis Leistung und da ist Huawei und Samsung einfach Top!! Über die Reihenfolge kann man diskutieren aber nicht darüber das so viele Samsung Handys dabei sind. OnePlus fehlt meiner Meinung nach noch.
VcpS8xYec0w;Samsung Galaxy Note 10 auf Platz 10?! Wtf!?! und note 9 kommt auf Platz 9 euer ernst?! Ey peinlich!
VcpS8xYec0w;Selten so eine schwachsinnige Liste gesehen...Ihr habt doch echt nicht mehr alle Latten am Zaun^^
VcpS8xYec0w;Also ich mag eure Videos echt gerne aber diese Rangliste geht überhaupt nicht. Jedes Gerät macht in einem Bereich Abstriche, dass beste Gesamtpaket ist technisch gesehen das Note 10 Plus. Es ist definitiv nicht perfekt und hat auch seine Macken, jedoch ist es das Smartphone bei den man die wenigsten Kompromisse machen muss, abgesehen vom Kopfhöreranschluss. Auch verstehe ich absolut nicht was Geräte von 2018 in diesem Test zu suchen haben, schade.
VcpS8xYec0w;Ein s9+ hat nichts zusagen in 2019,hell nicht mal als es damals auf dem markt kam.
VcpS8xYec0w;Platz 1: one plus 7t pro
VcpS8xYec0w;Also ich bin mit meinem iPhone 11 pro mehr als zu Frieden und muss sagen das Samsung nicht ansatzweise ran kommt.. nutze Apple seit 10 Jahren und habe Samsung zwischen durc auch mal ausprobiert (nebenbei) was soll ich sagen außer Samsung keine Chance
VcpS8xYec0w;Nie mehr iPhone, zu teuer wenn ich für wenig Geld genauso die Leistung bekomme ab 200 Euro 😂😂😂und wo Bleibt Sony ....???? Dann kann man eierphone in der Tonne hauen 😂😂😂
VcpS8xYec0w;nur die standart handys von samsung und go, ich wette das das Asus rog phone 2 locker die genannten geräte hier wegsteckt. Aber immer schön bei den Mainstream Firmen bleiben...
VcpS8xYec0w;das NOTE 10 ist für mich das beste  auch bei nacht top Aufnahmen ,besser wie Apple

uwjwLkV9rDk;Hoe jij huawei uitspreekt lol
uwjwLkV9rDk;Mi mix 3,
uwjwLkV9rDk;Mi 8 pro,
uwjwLkV9rDk;Mi a2 zijn de beste
uwjwLkV9rDk;De beste vind ik gewoon de Samsung galaxy j3 2017 hij is super goed en kost maar €160
uwjwLkV9rDk;De a6 2018 is ook mooi hoor voor 230 euro
uwjwLkV9rDk;Super amoled screen
uwjwLkV9rDk;Groote is 5.6
uwjwLkV9rDk;Ik heb een premium smartphone gekocht voor 276
uwjwLkV9rDk;Doe een keer beste budget smartwatch van het moment
uwjwLkV9rDk;Alle toestellen hebben nog een koptelefoonaansluiting... Tja, voor een Apple-gebruiker is dat gek, maar voor mij als Android-gebruiker is dat de normaalste zaak van de wereld.
uwjwLkV9rDk;Waar is de huawei p smart 2019
uwjwLkV9rDk;Edit laat maar
uwjwLkV9rDk;€400 lijkt me meer mid-range 🤔 als je t mij vraagt is €300 de max van budget
uwjwLkV9rDk;Op welke witte dingen staan de telefoons?
uwjwLkV9rDk;Waarom zit de xiaomi mi a 2 niet in de lijst
uwjwLkV9rDk;Umidigi... A3 pro al voor €80, en F1 voor €180
uwjwLkV9rDk;Geen Honor 8x?
uwjwLkV9rDk;Ik dacht altijd dat de poco F1 een midranger was met high-end specs.
uwjwLkV9rDk;De F1 is een uitstekende smartphone.
uwjwLkV9rDk;Premium 800+ haha nee man een mate 10 pro van Huawei of de 6t van Oneplus zijn echt geen midrange telefoons man
uwjwLkV9rDk;😍
uwjwLkV9rDk;Erwin wat voor telefoon gebruik jij ?
uwjwLkV9rDk;Huawei Mate 20 kost los 658 Euro, maar met Tele 2 abonnement (20GB, 100 belminuten) kost het maar 388 Euro. En je krijgt 100 eur cashback, dus 288 Euro. Dat is niet te geloven toch?
uwjwLkV9rDk;De Huawei p20 lite kost 260 euro op coolbleu en ik had hem op black friday zelfs voor 230 euro gekocht
uwjwLkV9rDk;koptelefoonUITgang ....
uwjwLkV9rDk;Goede video Bright
uwjwLkV9rDk;Te gek allemaal deze video`s.. Jullie zijn de enige waarbij ik een belletje heb.. Maar.. Erwin, Kap met het knakken van je vingers...   :'o)
uwjwLkV9rDk;De redactie loopt zeker allemaal met iPhones op zak dat ze denken dat 400 euro budget is?
uwjwLkV9rDk;Vorige week een galaxy S9 gekocht bij Tmobile koste €420 waarna je bij Samsung nog €100 cashback krijgt.
uwjwLkV9rDk;waawwey = huawei
uwjwLkV9rDk;Xiaomi mi a2 lite is ook wel lekkere in de bkr ( normaal €180)
uwjwLkV9rDk;Nu in aanbieding €160
uwjwLkV9rDk;Om eerlijk te zijn mis ik de kleinere merken zoals Vernee..? Had de Vernee M8 graag gezien
uwjwLkV9rDk;Goed bezig
uwjwLkV9rDk;LG G7, beste koop en best getest door consumentenbond. Echt een aanrader
uwjwLkV9rDk;Ik denk dat veel mensen geïnteresseerd zijn in de BKR categorie.... Voor veel mensen ook het echte werk ...voorderest natuurlijk weer een leuke video!
uwjwLkV9rDk;G6 voor 170? Hebben jullie een linkje?
uwjwLkV9rDk;Yes nieuw video
uwjwLkV9rDk;Broeders?
uwjwLkV9rDk;Oeps, Nokia 8.1 heeft net als de andere twee wel dual-sim
uwjwLkV9rDk;Geen iPhone 😂😂😂
uwjwLkV9rDk;wat dacht je van de xaomi mi a2 lite
uwjwLkV9rDk;Ik heb de a7 2018 en die noemde ze ergens anders nog midrange terwijl die nog geen €300 koste
uwjwLkV9rDk;Waar is de honor 8x? Wel leuke video
uwjwLkV9rDk;ik weet maar een budget telefoon noem ik geen telefoon van 300 euro maar zal weer aan mijn liggen
uwjwLkV9rDk;Probeer de Homtom ht70
uwjwLkV9rDk;Wel misleidend dat nokia met de nokia 8 en 8 sirocco twee flagship hadden, en de 8.1 ineens een midrange toestel is
uwjwLkV9rDk;mAh spreek je niet uit als MAHHH
uwjwLkV9rDk;Ik denk dat de beste budget telefoon de s8 op dit moment is 399euro
uwjwLkV9rDk;Waar om staat de huwai p smart plus er niet in die is 289
uwjwLkV9rDk;Weten jullie wanneer de Samsung xcover 5 komt
uwjwLkV9rDk;Wanneer komt midrange? Kijk er naar uit!
uwjwLkV9rDk;Ik heb de Nokia 1 2018 model met de nieuwste android super feine telefoon
uwjwLkV9rDk;Honor 10 misschien ook nog? Kirin 970 4gb ram 300 euro....?
uwjwLkV9rDk;ik heb een j5 2017 die is 250 euro of minder
uwjwLkV9rDk;op de tumbnail geef je aan 6 telefoons..
uwjwLkV9rDk;🧐

49IOK1Z8F2I;Der Moment wenn du seit 3 Jahren das gleiche Handy benutzt weil deins vor 2 Monaten kaputt gegangen ist
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:45 was'n scherzbold
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:50 fast gelacht
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ihr holt euch auch schon jedes halbjahr ein neues Handy oder?🤦‍♂️
49IOK1Z8F2I;Gebt nur jedes Jahr Unsummen für ein beschissen Smartphone aus :D
49IOK1Z8F2I;"Wer mal den Begriff ""geplante Obsoleszenz"" gehört hat, wird hoffentlich zum Nachdenken angeregt."
49IOK1Z8F2I;WO IST DAS FAULTIER?!😭
49IOK1Z8F2I;"Hi Kilian könntest du mal ein Video nach dem Motto:""Diese Kameras nutzen wir "" machen würde mich sehr freuen"
49IOK1Z8F2I;Man merkt wieder wie einfach es ist in das Apple Ecosystem zu fallen
49IOK1Z8F2I;Danke, dass ich dabei sein durfte!🔥Sind sehr coole Smartphones dabei✌🏼
49IOK1Z8F2I;Dieses Format ist so cool!!!
49IOK1Z8F2I;Eine Frage: Wann wird der Gewinner vom Gewinnspiel bekannt gegeben?
49IOK1Z8F2I;Kommt eigentlich noch ein Video zur Apple Watch ⌚️?
49IOK1Z8F2I;Hab bei dem Video eine Frage: wie würde das Ergebnis aussehen, wenn ihr die Smartphones selber kaufen müsstet/ würdet? :D
49IOK1Z8F2I;Wenn dieses Video kommt, dann weiß man wieder wie schnell das Jahr vergeht :(
49IOK1Z8F2I;1:43 Wer?
49IOK1Z8F2I;Also ich finde die neuen IPhones ziemlich schön ...

49IOK1Z8F2I;3:50 weirdste flex
49IOK1Z8F2I;5:35 Ich musste mir so vorstellen wie Kilian in den Wald geht und Blätter mit dem iPhone vergleicht ob diese in den Shot passen 😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;Cooles Video habs wieder gleich am Anfang wie es rauskommt angeschaut
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich nutze das note 10 plus falls es jemanden interessiert 😂😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:04 Holy shit ich hab Martin noch nie Deutsch sprechen hören xd

49IOK1Z8F2I;Also der Franz weiß was gut ist (Huawei P 30 Pro)😁👍
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich finde dieses Video ziemlich gut, da man sieht, welches Smart Phone die Leute benutzen, die Ahnung haben
49IOK1Z8F2I;Echt cool das ihr Jocr reingenommen habt 👌😁
49IOK1Z8F2I;Man sollte denn daily Driver nicht so oft wechseln ich habe ein Note 3
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:41 weird flex😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;Geiles Video doch ich habe das Gefühl, dass dieses mal weniger YouTuber als sonst mitgemacht haben.📱⌚️
49IOK1Z8F2I;Alle: nutzen ein 18:9 oder mehr Handy
49IOK1Z8F2I;Kilian: 16:9!
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich: danke, mein Moto G5 ist ja noch gut!
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:36 weird flex
49IOK1Z8F2I;Die neue Art der Apple Werbung
49IOK1Z8F2I;Tolle Kamera viele   Bugs 🤠

49IOK1Z8F2I;Das sind immer die besten Videos im ganzen Jahr! 😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;Warum nutzt niemand OnePlus 7t (pro) ?😭
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich ❤️ dieses Format!
49IOK1Z8F2I;Bei Joel kann ich euch schon vorhersagen welches Smartphone er nächstes benutzen wird 😂😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;Kannst du mal ein Review zum OnePlus 7t Pro machen?
49IOK1Z8F2I;Das Review zum 7t war mega und der Vergleich der beiden würde mich mal interessieren.
49IOK1Z8F2I;Immer wieder ein geiles Format, Kilian 🙏🏼
49IOK1Z8F2I;Omg @techaltar hört sich soooo komisch an auf deutsch XD. Einer der besten YT Kanäle.
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich benutze mein Samsung s6 Edge seit 4 Jahren😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich finde das IPhone 11 auch so gut. Vielen Danke für das toll Video ♥️
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich freue mich jedes Jahr auf dieses Video!😋
49IOK1Z8F2I;Fazit: 3 Android (2 Samsung, 1 Hauwei), 5 Apple
49IOK1Z8F2I;527 Elemente werden von Volumen (D:) nach Programmen (C:) verschoben
49IOK1Z8F2I;Kein s10+ ? D:
49IOK1Z8F2I;Und jedes Jahr ein neues Smartphone :D
49IOK1Z8F2I;Anstatt das alte etwas länger zu benutzen
49IOK1Z8F2I;diese qualität 😍 göttlich 🔥
49IOK1Z8F2I;An Julian: du kannst im App Store die Dateien App von Apple laden (ist dann wie auf dem mac)
49IOK1Z8F2I;Immer wieder interessant. 👍
49IOK1Z8F2I;Weiter so...
49IOK1Z8F2I;Aber nächstes Mal mit dem Technikfaultier!
49IOK1Z8F2I;Cool ich bin grad auch in Taiwan, Kenting!
49IOK1Z8F2I;5:36 richtig geiler shot
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:43 weird flex bro
49IOK1Z8F2I;Wie ich das Format vermisst habe! 😍
49IOK1Z8F2I;Wer kommt auch grad vom I phone 11 das etwas andere Review?😉
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich finde das immer die coolesten Videos, würde mich btw sehr über ein Note 10 vs Iphone 11 (die inzwischen fast gleich viel kosten)  Video freuen
49IOK1Z8F2I;Endlich😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;Kannst du Mal ein Video zu dem realme X2 pro machen? Bin letztens auf das Smartphone gestoßen und fande es extrem interessant für den Preis.
49IOK1Z8F2I;Kein Oneplus 😭
49IOK1Z8F2I;Mega stark, dass du immer Mäxel mit rein nimmst. Er hat sowas von mehr Aufmerksamkeit verdient.
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:46 wierd flex but okay xD
49IOK1Z8F2I;3:46 wierd flex but okay xD
49IOK1Z8F2I;Jocr schon jetzt sympathisch wegen dem Oberteil
49IOK1Z8F2I;Das ist sooo ungewohnt Martin von TechAltar auf deutsch sprechen zu hören 😁 Aber sehr cool das er hier mit dabei ist.
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich benutze das Ulefone Note 7p
49IOK1Z8F2I;Joel ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
49IOK1Z8F2I;"Sehr cooles Video! Mach weiter so! ;)"
49IOK1Z8F2I;"Gutes Video. Aber ich hab komm immer noch nicht auf den ""Bart"" klar xD Fand ohne süßer ^.^"
49IOK1Z8F2I;Edit: Wieso bin ich eigentlich in den Video? Kappa
49IOK1Z8F2I;TechAlter - bester Mann, diesmal auch mal in deutsch 😁👍🏻
49IOK1Z8F2I;Tja mir hat der aktuelle DailyDriver von Venix gefehlt 😉😂
49IOK1Z8F2I;#insider
49IOK1Z8F2I;Endlich wieder so ein video❤
49IOK1Z8F2I;Da kann ich @Mäxel nur zustimmen. 😀
49IOK1Z8F2I;Ich liebe dieses Format und das viele der bekannten Youtuber mitmachen, danke dafür 👍
49IOK1Z8F2I;Habe darauf gewartet
49IOK1Z8F2I;watched it on my poco f1
49IOK1Z8F2I;Genau auf dieses Video habe ich gewartet😁✌️

PxJo6idz9J0;Happy to know that there are so many things I dont need at all 😂
PxJo6idz9J0;The first one seems handy.
PxJo6idz9J0;most of them are Unpractical, Unnecasary  for everyday home cooking. Useless stuff😏
PxJo6idz9J0;A regular cheese grater with a stupid head on it no thank you smh
PxJo6idz9J0;The grommet is brilliant!
PxJo6idz9J0;That cheese shredder 🤣🤣🤣
PxJo6idz9J0;Sweet nostalgia??!! Lol
PxJo6idz9J0;It also hard to clean
PxJo6idz9J0;where does one buy the One pot lid, please?
PxJo6idz9J0;cheese grater looks like my 30 yr old one.
PxJo6idz9J0;I like the stirrer only because I think it would be good for risotto instead of stirring for like 20 mins.
PxJo6idz9J0;Found one thing most interesting...the SHREDDER Well I am a tmnt geek
PxJo6idz9J0;Stainless steel soap, you get the same if you rub hands on steel taps, it's for getting rid of odours
PxJo6idz9J0;Crème brûlée torch really? I've had one for over TWENTY YEARS.
PxJo6idz9J0;Stuff we don't really need
PxJo6idz9J0;I’m grateful you shared these cool gadgets with us. I know what to get when I’m ready & where to get them. Thank you!🙏🏾

1UHn6nMzEDo;Hydra light and battle visor are badly rated because they don’t work. Beware
1UHn6nMzEDo;So i need 3 trilights.
1UHn6nMzEDo;One to boost your car
1UHn6nMzEDo;Second to give you light.
1UHn6nMzEDo;Third to warn others
1UHn6nMzEDo;Electric paint lamp $52....I’ll buy a flash light or a bic lighter lol
1UHn6nMzEDo;He's the first to go camping with a street racing bike lol
1UHn6nMzEDo;$9.800 for a drone your having a laugh.
1UHn6nMzEDo;I need to know what text to speech package they're using for the narrator. it's really good.
1UHn6nMzEDo;I want Cleo, I like how it is built and I want to see if I can make it bigger.
1UHn6nMzEDo;The automated voice should have a Russian accent.
1UHn6nMzEDo; Is the laptop-stand (@7:50) available in a size for tablets?
1UHn6nMzEDo;that sled and battle blocker  was around  in the 80's
1UHn6nMzEDo;"Hexbot : ""My name is Jeff!"""
1UHn6nMzEDo;Really Cleo? With a non hd camera too? Smh
1UHn6nMzEDo;Safedome. Great
1UHn6nMzEDo;Cleo looks good. Thanks Ben for the warning on Hydra light and Battle visor

1UHn6nMzEDo;Cleo. Your attractive neighbour has never felt so exposed.
1UHn6nMzEDo;cleo drone is $9800! lol
1UHn6nMzEDo;who rides heavy iron made bicycles for magnet lights to hold on? stone age welcome to aluminium and carbon
1UHn6nMzEDo;Great idea, laptop stand 👍👍💃
1UHn6nMzEDo;1:49 wtf? thats in my home town!

1UHn6nMzEDo;$10,000 for that stupid doughnut shaped drone at the end.
1UHn6nMzEDo;"Funny, this idea was used in a pair of "" Sports Glasses ( prescriptions ) I had, some 36 years ago.!, They were great for Deer hunting, poor  deer stood out clearly in the fall Brown rice fields."
1UHn6nMzEDo;Did I just see a commercial in the middle of a commercial?

1uYA6pA48Ac;When you look up cool gadgets and you get a video with a mop in it 🤣😂🤣
1uYA6pA48Ac;This video wasted my time
1uYA6pA48Ac;"Socrates used to say ""IAM so happy to see so many things in this market that I don't need""."

1uYA6pA48Ac;The mouse sized printer is great if it actually does what it says, i also like the display thingy that hangs around your neck, the money belt is pretty good as well, the rest i could live without.
1uYA6pA48Ac;Me, trolling: hey thats mine
1uYA6pA48Ac;Little brother: i dont see your name on it

1uYA6pA48Ac;Number 9 though, there are pocket flashlights that can do all that today and more, they were available on 2018 as well.
1uYA6pA48Ac;7:54 My first thought....what is happening oh Lord please help this lady!

1uYA6pA48Ac;this is junk
1uYA6pA48Ac;Dude the bely is at least a 5 years old
1uYA6pA48Ac;That backpack needs rollers/wheels and telescoping handle option.
1uYA6pA48Ac;The mouse sized printer I'll die to get
1uYA6pA48Ac;I like how you buy the edge thing and you never use it, most people just hire people to paint them the house/flat and even those who do it on their own will use it like 2 times in 10 years
1uYA6pA48Ac;These commercials remind me of early 2000’s commercials

1uYA6pA48Ac;Ok for the first one, how do you know where it starts ?????
1uYA6pA48Ac;Black and decker.  Israeli company!
1uYA6pA48Ac;I'll use the belt to smuggle my drugs past security. like he said there is no metal components to set off the buzzers. XD
1uYA6pA48Ac;Whoa!! A money belt with a hidden pocket!!! What an innovative idea! REALLY!?!
1uYA6pA48Ac;So heavier people can't carry money in the secret compartment belt? My grandmother has a 44 inch waste.
1uYA6pA48Ac;nice
1uYA6pA48Ac;whats the name for that electronic thing like a necklace
1uYA6pA48Ac;Such an incredible one❤️❤️❤️
1uYA6pA48Ac;no 3 ....lol you only need it if you live in a country that still uses cash a lot, such as United States.
1uYA6pA48Ac;Money belt sucks! No one carries cash anymore.😂
1uYA6pA48Ac;good
1uYA6pA48Ac;good

1uYA6pA48Ac;Is this an Amazon advert? Ohh hold on the only cool one isn't available on Amazon.
1uYA6pA48Ac;Not xcited
1uYA6pA48Ac;I just love these updates for the techies
1uYA6pA48Ac;Ecoboshibiyah!
1uYA6pA48Ac;The secret moneybelt... They just HAD to advertize their name-logo on the buckle didn't they? Idiots...
1uYA6pA48Ac;Hi
1uYA6pA48Ac;The car organizer...… it's a box. Seriously, it's a box. I bought a sturdy metal ammo box at a yard sale for next to nothing and that's where I keep my car trunk stuff. There are two advantages to my system, the first is that the box will never tear, rip, or become permanently dirty ( wipe - clean painted metal surface ) and the second is that it cost me less than two dollars.
1uYA6pA48Ac;Do they make that money belt in big sizes or fat guys like me?
1uYA6pA48Ac;pagan
1uYA6pA48Ac;Who else is watching this in 2021?
1uYA6pA48Ac;Yeah you're going to see somebody ahead of you in line just start unzipping a belt and pulling money out of it to give to somebody and then they're going to struggle for 5 minutes LOL

1uYA6pA48Ac;Who stores their cell phones and water bottles in the trunk?
1uYA6pA48Ac;I mean come on it's not that fun and it probably will never be and in the end it will get boring and annoying
1uYA6pA48Ac;And the mop, imagine that scene exactly the same but only thing gone being the music, it's just some crazy weirdo dancing in there house with a mop.
1uYA6pA48Ac;This dude is probably using bots to boost video views and likes based of the 80 comments.  Also, channels like these deserve to be burned. They do nothing but edit together ads from the products and add transitions and shitty copyright free music. No effort at all.
1uYA6pA48Ac;print brush on pants = completely fake!
1uYA6pA48Ac;"Lol someone walks by, "" look away kids l, you don't want to be like her"""

Sx-0WwXVdwI;Thanks for just reading bad Chinese to English Amazon listings 🤦‍♂️
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Had to laugh at the pet feeder.  One hungry dog being fed a few morsels of dry food...by a CAT shaped dispenser 🤣🤣🤣
Sx-0WwXVdwI;5:50 bold of you to assume I have friends
Sx-0WwXVdwI;I like how there are commercials in the middle of this commercial. Commercial Inception. What a time to be alive.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Love watching this when I can't figure out what to buy😂
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Wonder cube has been out of stock for years... Nice research brother
Sx-0WwXVdwI;I want to clean my cloth in ten minute of time

Sx-0WwXVdwI;The pet feeder looks like it’s for cats...it’s shaped like a cat and gives very little food for dogs.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;The clothing thing doesnt clean quickly - granted, if you just have 1 item that you absolutely must wear within 15mins then you could argue it’s fast BUT if you have several items then it’s a stupid idea.

Sx-0WwXVdwI;Hello ,
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Which software you are using for voice over.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;?
Sx-0WwXVdwI;English is not the first or second language of who ever put this video together. It’s not as annoying as thoughts defence review video though.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;https://youtu.be/ez--GLAxj8I
Sx-0WwXVdwI;is this AI text to voice ?
Sx-0WwXVdwI;written by Chinese companies?
Sx-0WwXVdwI;This long ass commercial..
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Nice video, but please edit the dialogue before giving it to the narrator. It sounded VERY unprofessional. And, Narrator, don't be afraid to say something when the copy sounds like nonsense!
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Want a piece of garbage? Ticwatch pro!
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Can somebody make wopet for humans please?
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Otg in this list........apple users r indeed slow....
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Amazing gadgets
Sx-0WwXVdwI;lol
Sx-0WwXVdwI;I bought the WoPet and 2 months after I bought it I came home from work to find out my dog learned how to use it and ate all the food.👍👍😀
Sx-0WwXVdwI;To 300K
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Nobody does spinners anymore
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Does anyone edit these scripts? It sounds like your voiceover guy is just reading the badly-translated Chinese press release.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;1 skips first forced Google Ad
Sx-0WwXVdwI;2 searches for why the
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Ten minute of time???? Seriously.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Nice video but Ticwatch Pro number 1 no way.  I bought one 9 months ago. Battery is terrible 2 days at best in shared mode. Google assistant doesn't work most time the response time is terrible. So much that the screen times itself out before it wakes up from LCD mode.  Mobvoi customer service is appalling. I unfortunately also bought a ticband at the same time.  The strap broke but when trying to claim in warranty I am told they don't make them anymore so tough!  Great customer service waste of money  and won't be purchasing anything from them ever again
Sx-0WwXVdwI;The cube says  smartphone,  but it had a lightning port? Shouldn't it be usb-c?
Sx-0WwXVdwI;junk
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Do you have a Chinese guy write your script... in English?
Sx-0WwXVdwI;all junk
Sx-0WwXVdwI;nice
Sx-0WwXVdwI;My dog won’t eat kibble
Sx-0WwXVdwI;It you give bad voice ....    lousy.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;No
Sx-0WwXVdwI;為什麼您為什麼Dumb Fucks抱怨該視頻，卻全看了-如此愚蠢的American Geeks
Sx-0WwXVdwI;The TickWatch Pro has an F rating at Fakespot.com. Beware.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;the dog bowl should have a camera built in so you can see your pet whilst away from home.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;It was not the way he talked, listen to way the words where used. Example “lightweight” 2nd example first clip, the use of cares, he should say “ who cares about your whatever product”
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Where ever you went to school to learn how to speak English , I suggest you get your money back...
Sx-0WwXVdwI;❤❤
Sx-0WwXVdwI;I wouldn't trust anything this person recommends when he's just reading a script from the chinese. At least fix the grammer
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Kibble is bad for dogs!
Sx-0WwXVdwI;1. we have had automatic pet feeders for a decade, this is not future anything
Sx-0WwXVdwI;how many hundreds of dollars do they want for a bottle of fabreeze? in a ridiculous machine
Sx-0WwXVdwI;a car charger, seriously, that is new?

Sx-0WwXVdwI;Re the narrator........ek cedra ????? REALLY?  And many other poor pronounciations, e.g., light weighted instead of light weight.  Whoever narrated this needs some diction lessons.

Sx-0WwXVdwI;Your grammar is terrible.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;The WOPET is the pinnacle of idiocy. Anyone who’s ever spent time with a dog know that it needs to crap less than 5 mins after eating so feeding it while you’re away is a very bad idea.
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Super super good welcome to tamilnadu
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Learn English
Sx-0WwXVdwI;Was this read by a Chinese guy that can phonetically sound like he was speaking English? Because some of the words spoken are incorrectly used like it's his first time saying them in a sentence. Example, it's Google assistant and not Google assistance.

Jeeeez, that horrible background electronic fuzz pretend music,,, I'd honestly pay good money to make it stop. Here's how it is, that background fuzz is distracting in a bad way and it detracts from the video watching experience, makes it worse, much like being tormented by mosquitoes when you're out on the riverbank trying to fish. You put up with it because you want to be there, but it would be so much better without the mosquitoes.

SUMMUu5GIT4;I don't get it! Why in the world would the title and all notes be in English, yet your video is not! Is your language so limited that it can't translate all English text to what ever language your speaking.
SUMMUu5GIT4;Oh, you thought because you put subtitle in English, that this is OK. Wow, why would I want to read a video when I can just to a webpage and read. I give you a thumbs down, cause you miss lead me here and then force me with English subtitle, that is so wrong.  I am shock that you had this many views. I hope that more people wake up and give you more thumbs down.

eVpK7AfiC6E;Roses are red violets are blue I’ve gotten clickbaited and so did you
eVpK7AfiC6E;Nice job on the item in the thumbnail, really liked it, bought one myself. (sarcasm, if you couldn't tell)
eVpK7AfiC6E;roses are red
eVpK7AfiC6E;violets are blue
eVpK7AfiC6E;don't click read more

eVpK7AfiC6E;The first thing in number 4 seems like a joke
eVpK7AfiC6E;1:53 I’m actually impressed
eVpK7AfiC6E;click bait fric that
eVpK7AfiC6E;Surprisingly, the Cicret Bracelet wasn't mentioned at all, despite being in the thumbnail! You'll just get dislikes if you don't show people the thing they literally clicked on the video for. And the Cicret Bracelet isn't even legit.
eVpK7AfiC6E;5:58 Whenever and wherever
eVpK7AfiC6E;Not in a desert
eVpK7AfiC6E;Could you imagine how awkward it would be if you decided to bend down to drink from the river, and someone walked past, staring at you the whole way
eVpK7AfiC6E;All great products, number 5 is awesome!
eVpK7AfiC6E;I new it was click bait it was the screan to a droid turbo i know cus i have 1 i wasnt clickbaited i just wanted 2 c the stuff
eVpK7AfiC6E;roses are red
eVpK7AfiC6E;violets are blue
eVpK7AfiC6E;I just got clickbaited

eVpK7AfiC6E;U know when I first saw the video I thought I would find something cool
eVpK7AfiC6E;5:36 can someone please explain to me how that is gonna clean it 😂
eVpK7AfiC6E;I knew it was clickbait yet that thumbnail made me click it
eVpK7AfiC6E;was the budget for these commercials under $20
eVpK7AfiC6E;Ughhhhhhhhh why does this keep on happening
eVpK7AfiC6E;wow this was sooo clickbait but I liked it anyway
eVpK7AfiC6E;Nice job on the thumbnail I might’ve even brought it... you know.... if it was real.
eVpK7AfiC6E;Shoot I rlly hoped this wasn’t clip bait 😂
eVpK7AfiC6E;funny you look at reviews on amazon about all these and they all are FAILS
eVpK7AfiC6E;Damn I wanted the thumbnail
eVpK7AfiC6E;Most clickbaty thumbnail on the plant am I right
eVpK7AfiC6E;Bought the thing on the thumbnail it’s cool but it’s kind of clunky
eVpK7AfiC6E;Nano Tech doesnt change the size of the phone, but makes it wider by half an inch.
eVpK7AfiC6E;Bro I’m ur 500 sub
eVpK7AfiC6E;You have the best laugh.

eVpK7AfiC6E;But how do you take the nano hold thing off som thing once you stick it?!?!!
eVpK7AfiC6E;Who also doesn’t trust the ‘nano hold’? Especially not above a hob. My experience around suction cups holding things up... is not good.
eVpK7AfiC6E;I almost feel bad you can't monetize this

3IMQTJDDjIs;Greetings from Romania
3IMQTJDDjIs;amazing vector
3IMQTJDDjIs;Don't buy Anki Vector. Anki stopped with producing and stops selling those robots. They might put the servers off where Anki Vector runs on. You never know, because they still pay for it while they don't make a profit. I don't know why that one is on the list! You should buy the Anki Cozmo instead. They also don't update Vector anymore, he doesn't even have that much what you can do with it.
3IMQTJDDjIs;Vector!
3IMQTJDDjIs;I'll buy it
3IMQTJDDjIs;Nice to finally see your face again!

iU_Yl1uXnCs;3:58 It comes with 8 steaks!? Cool!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;"These are all cool but I will be SO glad when they finally refine the ""Glass Batter"" that will charge fast and keep the charge longer. Ion Batteries are OK but the Dangerous part bothers me a LOT"
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I have an idea. I've been homeless a lot, and as a result, have to keep packing light. While camping stuff is great, it would be nice to see more multipurpose items that can help one to survive out here. Besides helping us, it would be great for RVers, camping people and minimalist and homesteaders alike. In today's world, space saving and multipurpose items are a plus.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;There a few things that I love to get for my long road trip
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I need it all!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;the trouble with the smart auto gadgets is deciding which one you want! all of them! haha Gadgets is full of cool ideas that are really usefull! the down side is too many temptations!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I like the cook stove that charges ur phone too.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;The Tensile Vista - so bears can get to you from ALL sides.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;#1 surprised me after already knowing a little from under the title.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I like the tents that you’re hanging in a tree that was a pretty cool keep up the good work guys
iU_Yl1uXnCs;$116 for a water bottle is outrageous
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Reminds me of when my boys were little and we went on a YMCA/Indian guide trip. We loaded up all the bushcraft gear. Got there & was surrounded by Beamers with GROCERY sacks in the trunk full of junk. Damn, it was a hoot watching that circus.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Are any of these things on the market ?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Essentials - LoL
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I have the original bio light stove with both of the accessories and love it.  I can imagine how much better the new one is. Thanks for the video.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;"I don't think we define, ""Essential"" in the same way. Must be generational?"
iU_Yl1uXnCs;What you really need:  Water filter, waterproof fire starter, boiling/cooking pot, quality tent and sleeping bag, everything else is personal choice.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;kodiak canvas truck bed tent これイイですね～！！
iU_Yl1uXnCs;軽トラにもサイズ合いますか？
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Luv my biolite ...a little on the heavy side, but great for smokeless fire, and can hook up a small stove pipe to it...for indoor heating
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Interesting ideas. I have the bio lite stove.

iU_Yl1uXnCs;Over all great information and it’s done clean.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Liked the bug zapper most!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;My wife says l’m a hot pocket. So l’ve got that going for me
iU_Yl1uXnCs;One of the first
iU_Yl1uXnCs;minds eye camping edition?????? YES MOAR PLEASE
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Awesome gadgets!  Thanks for the uodate
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I like those teardrops but with a gallery in the back
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Aww C'mon these arnt for the average campers these are for the well off & rich weekend campers WTF, yeah the average camper Carrie's bunk beds & a cooler in his or her backpack
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Make a Fire so I can charge my phone. How do you make fire ?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;This is nothing more than an product advertisement platform!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Has anyone used that suspension tent?  I wonder how comfortable or durable they are.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Am I the only one to skip an ad to watch a bigger ad? 😂
iU_Yl1uXnCs;How about ways to maintain ice to keep your food cold on long trips?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Nice
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I have the cots and love them! They are super easy to set up and comfy to sleep on. They pack up in 2 slim carry cases about the size of 2 messenger bags and about 15lbs each. They make sturdy bunkbeds or 1x1 beds and a great easily transforming couch. I suggest buying the additional height extensions.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;You have to train yourself how to use whatever resources you have on hand to make things work in order to survival, not just prepared.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I like your purple hair!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Still cool stuff
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Cool stuff every backyard camper would ever need.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Yay you finally made a camper GEAR video
iU_Yl1uXnCs;A
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Where can I get the Lunatec aqua bottle?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Wow you are beautiful lady god bless you
iU_Yl1uXnCs;What is the economic situation right now?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;T(e one thing about the Tentsile Vista is the bugs get to you easily
iU_Yl1uXnCs;You guys make awesome videos!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Nice job researching and presenting your videos.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Awesome concept
iU_Yl1uXnCs;All good stuff there & very practical!!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Super ENERGIE ULTIMA E CEVA FANTASTIK MULTUMESC Ewanghelina Elisabeth Engyi
iU_Yl1uXnCs;i am looking for a safe but dependable tent style heater for my van for trip to Alaska
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I have to go shopping!! Great video!!!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;No. #1....
iU_Yl1uXnCs;The Goal Zero Switch 10?   Yeah used to be cool, the fan will crap first,,,Oh, and the battery? ..is NOT  replaceable,,,so the whole unit goes to the trash,.....Look up Goal Zero's credo.....
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I bet you don’t really look like that Glen!  While I’m at it can I have the phone number of the lady that announces the numbers... cause I think I’m in love 😍
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I want that aqua bot
iU_Yl1uXnCs;V_g00D
iU_Yl1uXnCs;the title should be: How to make camping dumb af
iU_Yl1uXnCs;hi chandni  will you be my girlfriend ??
iU_Yl1uXnCs;You don't need any of these things.  You remember camping with the Boy Scouts before we had smart phones, or the cellular system?  Some people still camp with nothing but wood, and stone (I've done it.)  Others with pretty much just a knife, ultralight through-hikers tend to keep it down to the gear you can fit in a fanny pack, and the clothes on our back, so we're not weighed down with gear, and can climb over ridges, instead of going around.  None of these are Essentials, and if you get bogged down with having the newest most innovative gear, you tend to miss the forest for the screens.  I'm not telling you how to camp, nor how to enjoy it, but these are gimicks, not essentials.  (Personally, 2 things I don't take into the woods are sticks, and fuel.)
iU_Yl1uXnCs;So I noticed people put their wall AC units outside their tent blowing in. Why can’t you just put the window AC unit inside the tent?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;good idea 👍👍👍👍
iU_Yl1uXnCs;The last invention are been old, it was  been invented after ww2 my grand pa had a radio wich are function when he light a special lamp, it  heat've charge the battery from this radio , and even he have then a lanterne with a dinamo, when the people want light , they have to push a part from this lanterne and it function well.A lot of old invention was lost  ,and now rediscovered again !
iU_Yl1uXnCs;You need to clear on where each product  can be found.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;The only thing I'd be interested in (the mattress pad) is ridiculously expensive.  $180 for a 6x2 mattress pad?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;290,074 views
iU_Yl1uXnCs;The production on your video is good. Price and weight of products would be VERY helpful. Thanks.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Good video
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Bug zapper?  Just get a thermacell for mosquitoes nothing works better.  I use it every summer here in Alaska and it works better than deet and chemicals.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;My camping essentials:
iU_Yl1uXnCs;1) A camper van
iU_Yl1uXnCs;2) A folding camper to tow behind (1)
iU_Yl1uXnCs;3) Solar panels to fit on top of (1)
iU_Yl1uXnCs;So Beautiful video
iU_Yl1uXnCs;None of these are exactly new or groundbreaking. Bit of a disappointment.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Should do a 2 year followup and see how many of these products failed in the marketplace.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Chandni is cute
iU_Yl1uXnCs;You would have to burn half the forest down with the bio light to charge your phone.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Everybody loves,to sleep in a hammock...for 20 minutes
iU_Yl1uXnCs;don't like your purple hair
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I have an idea.  I am attempting to write a short story about several people who wake up in a mysterious place (i.e. another world?) and all they have are boxes of 2019 modern camping gear to survive.  I feel this idea would also, maybe, make a great film.  What do you think?  Which items would you show case?
iU_Yl1uXnCs;lots of great gadgets 4 camping good job guys
iU_Yl1uXnCs;The last video on this list is my favourite
iU_Yl1uXnCs;If you’re using any of this crap, you’re not camping.
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I wonder if Americans know a Cot is what a baby sleeps in? It's just called a bed if its for an adult
iU_Yl1uXnCs;You do people a terrible disservice by promoting products that don't exist and never will. The majority of people who invest in products that don't exist yet on Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites get ripped off! And your channel is contributing to it!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;Mostly useless idea!
iU_Yl1uXnCs;I would not waste a penny on any of this crap.
UsQN1iCxT2M;I appreciate the editor adding the number/brand everytime they mentioned them
UsQN1iCxT2M;It made the video so much easier to follow
UsQN1iCxT2M;Monitor companies: We make expensive IPS monitors

UsQN1iCxT2M; Linus big p p confirmed?

UsQN1iCxT2M;Imagine if James participated
UsQN1iCxT2M;"""We had to blindfold James because he could recognize the monitors visually"""
UsQN1iCxT2M;Me watching on a TN panel :
UsQN1iCxT2M;Number 3 is the most colour accurate! Hey I'm actually right.
UsQN1iCxT2M;"meanwhile I'm wondering where my 25"" alienware AW2518H would fit in"
UsQN1iCxT2M;"I understand you wanted the ""out of box"" experience, but it would have been nice to see what everyone thought of the colors after they were calibrated with a Spyder."

UsQN1iCxT2M;Well dang boys.
UsQN1iCxT2M;We heard it from Linus himself, “size matters” 😂
UsQN1iCxT2M;The oldest mystery known to man
UsQN1iCxT2M;Having just bought a 27“ ips 1440/165hz, I was surprised at the costs. Then realized they're 1080. Ok makes sense now.
UsQN1iCxT2M;me: Finally buys a 240hz monitor
UsQN1iCxT2M;linus: SO HERE IS THE BEST 240HZ MONITOR!
UsQN1iCxT2M;me:

UsQN1iCxT2M;Kid: Watches a 240 HZ Monitor at 24 FPS On youtube
UsQN1iCxT2M;Same Kid: Ohhhhh That looks so cooool.  Mummy, Daddy I want a 240 HZ Monitor Look at it. It looks so good
UsQN1iCxT2M;After the video ended I realized that I was seriously considering getting that LG just to play Minecraft with it
UsQN1iCxT2M;No one:
UsQN1iCxT2M;ive never have anxiety in my life but  when linus points at the monitors with the sharpie really close i kinda freak out
UsQN1iCxT2M;whoa anime linus, never thought I'd see that
UsQN1iCxT2M;Linus : Which 240hz gaming monitor is the best
UsQN1iCxT2M;Meanwhile 60hz gamers : Yeah :)
UsQN1iCxT2M;Must be hard being an LTT employee, having to use US prices for videos and CAD prices for when actually buying things.
UsQN1iCxT2M;I’m getting my 240hz today. One year on a 144hz. I can’t wAit until I feel and see the difference !
UsQN1iCxT2M;08:44:00 AM
UsQN1iCxT2M;Ha, i'm sure you do.
UsQN1iCxT2M;i watched the whole sponsor segment at the start without realizing, thats what happen when linus isnt the one announcing it
UsQN1iCxT2M;I'm going to miss the world where I was excited about things like the latest monitor and graphics card.  These videos have a surreal feeling of a bygone era already.
UsQN1iCxT2M;David thought his monitor was calibrated right so to his eyes the accurate IPS panels looked like rainbows.
UsQN1iCxT2M;Maybe its just me but edsel is looking pretty chuncky as of late.
UsQN1iCxT2M;10:12 David's acknowledgement was deep and though provoking...
UsQN1iCxT2M;Nevermind the fact that you can adjust the settings on energy monitor. Not exactly a very good test imo
UsQN1iCxT2M;I watched the entire video imagining i can afford those things
UsQN1iCxT2M;0:39 linux animu
UsQN1iCxT2M;No AOC? dissapointed!
UsQN1iCxT2M;The rog strix actually is pretty good color wise once you adjust the settings. I have the monitor and it’s been hands down the best purchase I made
UsQN1iCxT2M;8:43 that is what she said
UsQN1iCxT2M;just bought my first 144hz 1ms TN display today... in 10 years I'll get one of these I guess
UsQN1iCxT2M;"""I prefer 24 inches... You wanna be like, right up in there"" No joke, this made me pause the video and go WTF is he talking about?! HAHAHA"
UsQN1iCxT2M;Love these kind of videos. It's like the wine snobs, blindfold most of them and their wine connoisseur bull-crap evaporates! Thanks Linus Tech Tips!!!!
UsQN1iCxT2M;Alright Linus I'm trying to get to Faceit level 10. I do not care how inaccurate my colors are.
UsQN1iCxT2M;"""As a gamer, I play my game hardcore"""
UsQN1iCxT2M;0:30 oh so its a payed limited version of fog imaging.  got it
UsQN1iCxT2M;I am never picky when playing games
UsQN1iCxT2M;"""Which Monitor waste my money more”"
UsQN1iCxT2M;"why is it that the colors that people say look ""truer to life"" just look really exceedingly green to me ?  I noticed this back with the blindd laptop test as well."
UsQN1iCxT2M;“Or maybe they're all the same” is the Intro Title of this video.
UsQN1iCxT2M;Don't get mad. I'm only quoting this videos Intro Title.
UsQN1iCxT2M;"8:25 ""size matters to me"""
UsQN1iCxT2M;Gets an Asian wife
UsQN1iCxT2M;7:55 I felt that
UsQN1iCxT2M;"Can I please have a monitor that is >=1440p, >=38"", 21 : 9 or 24 : 10, IPS panel with 10bit color accuracy, >=120HZ... What? Am I asking too much already? But I just started..."
UsQN1iCxT2M;"""but what does the screen look like with a viewing angle behind the monitor?"" who CARES"
UsQN1iCxT2M;I still want a 32-36-40 OLED  !~!  Cow}:-o)
UsQN1iCxT2M;Hi, i was wondering if u could make a review over the TUF VG259QM monitor, its a 280hz, IPS, 1ms display. But its only about 400$. I was really stoked to see such a great monitor for its price, but why so cheap. U are always my go to reviewer and almoste no one else has reviewed this monitor.
UsQN1iCxT2M;13:37 minutes long, hmmmm
UsQN1iCxT2M;Not gonna lie that cartoon Linus is sick and I kinda want one of myself someday.
UsQN1iCxT2M;I am really confused how do they get so much sponsorship when they upload daily
UsQN1iCxT2M;I WAS WAITING 4 THIS SO BAD 🤩🔥 omg thanks
UsQN1iCxT2M;I just bought my first 144Hz monitor!
UsQN1iCxT2M;And even that only because it was an outlet item... and it was a 10% off for all outlet items...
UsQN1iCxT2M;"""MSI MAG251RX"" what about this monitor?"
UsQN1iCxT2M;I’m still waiting on a 32” 4K ips screen with 100hz at least, low ms, bezeless, 10 bit ish for no more than $500. Apparently it can’t be done.
UsQN1iCxT2M;I recommend bigger screen because if you come on smaller screen you are like blind, bigger screen and you can see something after .
UsQN1iCxT2M;I will stay with my 1440p 240Hz Display that i overclocked to 270Hz :D
UsQN1iCxT2M;BenQ sent me that monitor a few months ago to make a review video and I’m still loving it. Actually makes it a lot easier to play better
UsQN1iCxT2M;I'm so happy with this video they really listened to all the complaints ♥️
UsQN1iCxT2M;This video was a real eye-opener.  Really painted the scene on monitors.
UsQN1iCxT2M;And those TN panels man... just twisted how much better they are these days.
UsQN1iCxT2M;That end made me think of slay the spire. Caw caw!
UsQN1iCxT2M;"It is not ""a good time to be a high fresh rate gamer"" - none of them match up to latency of more than decade old CRTs!"
UsQN1iCxT2M;I love knowing that someone is going to buy one of these monitors and only has a 750ti or some low end gpu and be disappointed that they aren't seeing a difference (cause the fps is too low)
UsQN1iCxT2M;0:13 Wait... Linus? A hardcore gamer?
UsQN1iCxT2M;I love lg monitors you get a lot of features packed in an ips for less
UsQN1iCxT2M;240hz just isn’t even needed
UsQN1iCxT2M;i remember when they were so pumped about the first one from asus lmao
UsQN1iCxT2M;"27"" 1080p? No, thanks! xD"
UsQN1iCxT2M;Would have loved to seen the Alienware 240hz TN and IPS panels compared against these
UsQN1iCxT2M;What a 1337 video! I love these comparisons, really well done.
UsQN1iCxT2M;When looking at these monitors I am instantly inclined to puke when I see the horrible colors etc. on #2. What a joke of a monitor. #1 is a lot better, #3 looks the best by far.
UsQN1iCxT2M;I'm mildly curious how many CS:GO players have raged every time Linus & Co. load into a match and afk as the bomb carrier while reviewing monitors xD
UsQN1iCxT2M;Even though I liked how the Acer looked the most, the LG is really difficult to pass up considering how well it did compared to it's price.
UsQN1iCxT2M;Thank you SO MUCH for labeling the monitors as they talk about them!!
UsQN1iCxT2M;This video was SO much easier to follow than the keyboard comparison video from not too long ago.
UsQN1iCxT2M;Maybe calibrate the monitors before testing??
UsQN1iCxT2M;0:39 That is disturbing
UsQN1iCxT2M;I'm broke, I spent my money on toilet paper. 🧻
UsQN1iCxT2M;10:27 prices
UsQN1iCxT2M;I feel like Taran needs a shower, he looks like  a dirty homeless guy.
UsQN1iCxT2M;Always great video's, well done!
UsQN1iCxT2M;I'd love to see a review of the Spectrum 1440p 240hz ips monitor when it comes out later this year. I'm ordering the 4k 144hz ips model myself.
UsQN1iCxT2M;Hey Linus. Just finished building my Gaming PC today, and commenting right now from it. Love your videos, keep up the good work!
UsQN1iCxT2M;I don't know which is a good 240hz monitor.
UsQN1iCxT2M;But the 240hz LTT underwear is really smooth
UsQN1iCxT2M;Nah, I will wait for the 640Hz models.
UsQN1iCxT2M;And then we have games like War Thunder where having high resolution, good contrast and high color accuracy can actually give you an advantage (especially in Air Battles, ... or Simulator Battles).
UsQN1iCxT2M;In case you are asking why:
UsQN1iCxT2M;spotting your enemy a few kilometer away while having a very similar color to the background is not the easiest thing to do.
UsQN1iCxT2M;8:23 That's what she said..
UsQN1iCxT2M;"""Size Matters"""
UsQN1iCxT2M;Linus 2020
UsQN1iCxT2M;is it playing a video or do they have the video on a lopper or kvm or something, cause that adds a lot of delay.  That delay is going to be nuts.
UsQN1iCxT2M;When 3 clearly looked the best the entire time
UsQN1iCxT2M;"8:24 that's what she said. ;)"
UsQN1iCxT2M;I know I'm asking for more of what was done already but the ViewSonic XG270 has been said to be a gamechanger. Be nice to know for sure.
UsQN1iCxT2M;Damn theese YouTube ads are getting out of hand....
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"""We forgot to plug the sponsor, we should reshoot the intro."""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"Linus: ""We can just edit it, our sponsors know what they're signing up for."""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Linus: Tap dangerously close to the back of a motherboard, shortly after complaining about having to take out the AIO
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"0:34 : LTT Editor, you didn't get the spirit of ""deep fake"", but at least you tried something <3"
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Imagine if they parred this with a fan controller and an RGB controller.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;1:32 I hope Seasonic has keyed that connector differently to the motherboard connectors.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Ahh... Aquatic hedgehog... Sea, Sonic. I get it Linus.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;This would be really interesting for the non case builds like desks/walls etc
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"Linus' new catch-phrase: ""And that's how the magnet crumbles!"""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;When Linus started hitting the motherboard with pilers was in tears 🤣🤣
XH_ItFEycHo&t;IMHO this would be perfect with cablemods specific length cables.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;People complaining about the price.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Me: Laughs in SFX PSU units
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"0:35 this is where my drunk self went ""HUH"" 😂"
XH_ItFEycHo&t;12:34:00 AM
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Linus: Hey man, he was in my face...
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Also Linus: I'm in my face!
XH_ItFEycHo&t;THAT SPONSOR SPOT FOR SEASONIC KILLED ME 😂😂😂😂
XH_ItFEycHo&t;LITERALLY my favorite one so far
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:55 this gave me an anxiety attack
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Jeremy Clarkson: Where are my hammers?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:55 Linus Sebastian: Where are my pliers?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;They should just work on a pin layout standard instead of this weird gimmick... Infuriates me that every manufacturer has its own
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"Linus at 8:20 : ""Just need the right tool for the job."""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Also Linus:  6:54
XH_ItFEycHo&t;1:48 Magnet: NOO, I will not be dropped by Linus Runs away and Trips
XH_ItFEycHo&t;0:34 best from whole video. I had a nice laugh from it.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;4:06 - Taran's issue was he ran out of USB ports for his macro keys
XH_ItFEycHo&t;When Linus see's a new Capacitor come out:
XH_ItFEycHo&t;HEY GUYS, TECHREX HERE
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"0:44 ""aquatic hedgehog?"""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;No! SUPER Aquatic Hedgehog!
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Looks great. 2 questions.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;1. Dont the magnets interfere with anything?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;2. Does the extra panel produce heat that might cause problems?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;1:50 me when I approach a girl
XH_ItFEycHo&t;An „Before and after“ picture would be great to have.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"Linus: ""Yknow, it looks like one of those old 20-pins, but if you plugged it into one of those, it'd definitely kill it."""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Me: DOOOO ITTTT
XH_ItFEycHo&t;It really looks stupid imo. Losses over such short cable runs as that inside a PC are not going to affect the efficiency that much.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;0:35 dat editing though...i have to give editor of this video a huge applause 👏👏👏
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:55......I thought every techie had a 16 oz framing hammer in his tool kit.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;When he did his thing with his head I felt like I was suddenly in the matrix lol
XH_ItFEycHo&t;this with custom cables is perfect for 'other room cooling complete silent build'!

XH_ItFEycHo&t;Me at 6:54 : shouldn't have said that
XH_ItFEycHo&t;0:34 did you forget to say the sponsor so you edited in?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;AC requires smaller wire to transmit, so in theory, you're also gaining a lot of increased stability/cleanliness by having shorter DC runs.

XH_ItFEycHo&t;It seems Taran has a macro to get Linus fix his workstation.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Sadly, there is no integrated fan hub, this would perfectly fit in this setup of less wiring and cleaner looks. Hope it gets it in the next revision.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;The way LTT handles stuff so violently has an odd energy to it.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Company logo in blue LED: 2010 called.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Who's one of the rare persons like I guess me who has seen the original derbauer video about it all the way back in Computex 2019?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I can’t believe that, after all these years of Seasonic having interchangeable cables...oh, wait...
XH_ItFEycHo&t;RIP Shadow, so sorry for your guys’ loss, I really feel for you
XH_ItFEycHo&t;0:34 When autocorrect misspells Linus's face
XH_ItFEycHo&t;My heart was pumping out of my chest when he was smashing the case with the freaking pliers without taking out the motherboard.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:26 Linus is a forsen viewer confirmed
XH_ItFEycHo&t;To this day, that motherboard is still seeing a therapist about the abuse it went through...
XH_ItFEycHo&t;.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"""Hey Linus do you know why only half of my memory is showing up after you installed that PSU?"""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Linus: 6:54 -- Nope.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I like the concept. If I were looking for a power supply, this would definitely be top 5.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;That is so weird, who the hell asked for this?  Interesting, but I’m not into it.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Admittedly, it looks great in that build
XH_ItFEycHo&t;this looks like a load of crap, talk about over engineering
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"""an old non-modular power supply"" linus most people wouldnt ever spend extra on not having slightly more cables than they need"
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"""One clean solution"""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Uhhh... that tagline is a bit... how do I put it?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Strong rare earth magnets near electronics, hmmm...
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:26 strong magnets inside the pc. Say bye bye to hard drives
XH_ItFEycHo&t;8:54 no the cover was not there so I think it could probably still fit.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;They're moving the tech towards Intel's push for single power port.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Expensive PC:
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Cave Man Linus: mods case with mobo still mounted by hammering with pliers
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"""not outlandishly priced"" is twice the price"
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Theoretically the PSU will be more efficient, but the block lowers efficiency. They're actually trying to implement that part of the conversion to the mobo. So PSUs are more efficient, and mobos less.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I love how u kept pestering the electrician about how he uses a pair of pliers as a hammer and yet here u are doing the same
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:36 that's what she said.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;This would be pretty useful for me since I have a huge cable mess and I need a short PSU. But it's so damn expensive and I already have a Seasonic PSU.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;With the case trend of leaving space behind the motherboard tray, this is actually perfect for a lot of high end cases. Very clever, Seasonic. I like it.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;They're trying to establish a new standard. I appreciate that.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;This video had such a funny timing when it comes to popping up in my recommended.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;My girlfriend just fried her Seasonic PSU.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;THIS is a power supply?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Seasonic : YES
XH_ItFEycHo&t;i thought my cable management couldn’t get worse, then i saw this thing
XH_ItFEycHo&t;We actually wanted to see more of inside the case where the cables come out the power supply
XH_ItFEycHo&t;My main concern is the converter unit will have insufficient ventilation since there isn't much clearance to the side panel. The other issue is the magnetic mounting can pose a problem if you have any mechanical hard drives.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Random idea: cooling a pc using dust cleaner like nitrous forcing cool air through the rig🤷‍♂️😅
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Sea sonic board members: how can we integrate the extension cord into our power supply’s?...
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Surely I wasn't the only one getting triggered when he started hitting the case WITH THE FREAKING MOTHERBOARD ON!!!!!!!!
XH_ItFEycHo&t;When Seasonic launched it, I knew it will appear here. The day has come!
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:27 Spending a lot of time with Alex I see.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I can see this being used for high end pcs of users who cheaped out on the case for a compact mid tower.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Like a meshify c, or a corsair 220T. Seriously, those psu compartment are too small for bigger psus....
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"""Plenty of time for this to go south..."" my life in a sentence haha"
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Why does watching Linus build something give me so much anxiety...
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Linus banging on a motherboard for a whole minute needs to be a meme
XH_ItFEycHo&t;omg the bangning with the pliers gave me a heartattack!
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Honestly, I'd pay the premium. This thing looks like it makes power routing about ten times easier.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;What about having magnets near mechanical drives? Can I still use them without interference?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;So they finally did something that HP has be doing with their high-end workstations for years.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;What case is it they were testing?  I don’t remember him saying.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;The moment he said 'This video is brou-' my phone auto restarted.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I just got a PulseWay ad with Linus as the man speaking character. And it seemed so natural that I thought it was part of the video
XH_ItFEycHo&t;If I'm ever gonna break in to the LTT warehouse to steal something, I'm gonna take the orange screwdriver Idk why.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;LTT video: exists
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Seasonic: ITS FREE REAL ESTATE
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Magnets... u know there’s going to be people saying the magnets screwed up their storage drives
XH_ItFEycHo&t;0:35 now thats creepy, Linus
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"Magnets so close to a motherboard, I guess it is ok since they have smart people there but a part of me is screaming ""that's gonna damage the motherboard and cause some weird shit to happen"""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;A product I might actually be interested in if I ever get my damn life back....
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I wonder if those magnets will interfere with the motherboard somehow.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;0:35 I had to replay this to make sure my CPU isn't acting up again.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;If the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, then the power supply is the mitochondria of the PC
XH_ItFEycHo&t;isnt it fun watching linus doing something with a computer while im here dreaming to get a PC lmao
XH_ItFEycHo&t;those wires kills my brain cells
XH_ItFEycHo&t;he manages  it almost every week man
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Am I the only one who tried to mute the annoying music, most likely coming from elsewhere, only to realise that the only way to stop it is to pause this video?
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Yeah, I had to go watch that sponsor clip in the intro like 5 times, they got their money's worth on that one hahaha
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I really want him to plug that thing into an old 20 pin motherboard connector...
XH_ItFEycHo&t;3:58 the moment everyone is here for
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Bruh I was worried that by hitting the metals it could short the ram on the back
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"hitler called it ""one clean solution"" and look how that turned out"
XH_ItFEycHo&t;That's interesting. There are definitely cases it would work especially well in, especially those without PSU shrouds.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;EDIT: So after a bit of searching & watching, I found out that you need a really strong magnet for that. Ignore the question under.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I love that design, when it's time to upgrade my PC I think I'm going to get this.  So clean.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Thermaltake did something similar 15 years ago.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;The plugs went into a separate unit installed in a 5 1/4 drive bay.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I'd like to think Linus was in a greenscreen jumpsuit to film that segue edit. Have fun getting that image out of your head.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;It would be an even better if they had cases specifically designed to make the most of the idea. Especially for mitx systems.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;the cable can reach it even when the fan is up and even when the psu is at the top ,you just turn upside down that long thing and its perfect!
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Did anyone else get served Linus’ Pulseway ad before this? I feel like the sponsor spots on the channel should be that elaborate more often.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Sorry this wasn’t as Good as I thought. You didn’t show us the cleaned side of the motherboard :-(
XH_ItFEycHo&t;"""Not outlandishly priced"""
XH_ItFEycHo&t;170 USD
XH_ItFEycHo&t;well thats almost the cost of a fully modular 1200W Corsair PSU
XH_ItFEycHo&t;I'm a little dissapointed that they didn't warn about putting magnets too close to the HDDs. Don't! Or face data wipeout.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;6:35 That's what she said.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;0:34 didn't know what nightmare fuel was until today.
XH_ItFEycHo&t;It’s funny at an Apple warehouse where I worked those magnets were like gold everyone kept stealing them from each other so they can hold up papers😂😂
XH_ItFEycHo&t;12:34:00 AM
XH_ItFEycHo&t;What the??
XH_ItFEycHo&t;Those cablemod guys will have a weird look at you, when you want to order 10-15cm long ATX power cables... xD
mnk6gnOBYIo;Seven seconds in and he's already followed tradition
mnk6gnOBYIo;I swear, every time Anthony shows up and talks, you know Linus hired the right guy!
mnk6gnOBYIo;"Head of Marketing: ""Just call it whatever.  They're getting it cheap enough that they won't even care."""
mnk6gnOBYIo;Linus: 20$ SSD
mnk6gnOBYIo;Linus 9 minutes later: have you ever thrown a chicken?
mnk6gnOBYIo;"""It has been years since making 120GB SATA SSDs became unreasonable"" I beg to differ, I work in hardware sales, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I just got a shipment of 1200pcs of SATA 120GB SSD's and they are the best selling ones. 240gb and 480gb lag greatly behind, and bigger capacities arent even sold."
mnk6gnOBYIo;I'm pretty sure they used a random name generator for the name and went with the first one lol
mnk6gnOBYIo;Everyone: how good is a $20 ssd
mnk6gnOBYIo;Linus: how bad is a $20 ssd
mnk6gnOBYIo;Explains so much that Linus had to eat his pet goat.
mnk6gnOBYIo;The level of anger Linus had from notifications interrupting him. I felt that so hard. 😂
mnk6gnOBYIo;When you make a good product but you incompetent on every other standard 😂
mnk6gnOBYIo;Don't think Linus has to worry about warranties....they are automatically voided before parts are sent to him.
mnk6gnOBYIo;Fatty: Fat -> probably implying USA Dove: Freedom -> probably implying USA Made a product just to troll America lel
mnk6gnOBYIo;7:53 that is genius actually. wow.
mnk6gnOBYIo;This SSD is trending on Amazon in the electronic section.
mnk6gnOBYIo;Lol amazing the impact LTT has.
mnk6gnOBYIo;"tl;dw: It actually does what the package says at a reasonable speed, once you get past the Engrish."
mnk6gnOBYIo;I feel like we're all getting trolled. There is no way anyone can be this clumsy. I mean he has opposable thumbs, I can see them. Edward Scissorhands is more dextrous than Linus for crying out loud!!!
mnk6gnOBYIo;"""SLC hasn't been around even in the enterprise ...."" - It's not talking about SLC, it's talking about SLC technology cache. This means, it is using a portion of the TLC flash as SLC (as long as there is enough available) and then distributes that data later. This has been around for dram-less ssds for quite some time...."
mnk6gnOBYIo;Well, there's an overweight bird on it beacuse the company is called Fattydove.
mnk6gnOBYIo;Linus: We'll find out after a word from our sponsor.
mnk6gnOBYIo;Me: Double taps on the right side of the video
mnk6gnOBYIo;I want to see Linus and Anthony trade and wear each other’s clothes. All of them.
