24,"This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it."

This is what the companies say: We compared your DNA results to the reference populations we currently have in our database and estimated which of these were most similar to you in terms of the genetic markers you carry. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you belong to these groups or are directly from these regions, but that these groups were a similar genetic match.\nSo be careful what you think this test tells you."

707,"You look adorable in those maternity dungerees!"

Don't infect the baby with all that Taylor Swift shit! Let it listen to Whiplash by Metallica since Mike is such a fan! I know that it has two f-words in it but still. LOL! I'm sorry if that was insensitive. Anyway, congrats, you guys! Happy for both you. BTW, Fleur, you're already a mother of three as far as l'm concerned. You've done good job taking care of the poopies and Piggy wiggy, so you're already halfway there."

842,"Is there a making of somewhere ?"	
843,"This reminds me of feeling like as a child you never really fit in or were understood, a feeling of being left out in the cold. But then you realize that who you are was really calling for you to get back to your authentic self a coming home of some sort. You see your self fully and realize that you were never really lost. You've come home to yourself, you are now the observer."	
844,"Idk what's the meaning but it gives me anxiety\nI fucking hate lifts"	
845,"Wow!! loved it!\ntheres some references some previuos videos like robin *the guy with the purple beanie and the fishbowl*\n from paranoid android\n\npretty radioheadish kind of video \nawesome!"

896,"Radiohead ha estrenado un nuevo videoclip para su canción “Lift“, uno de los temas inéditos incluidos en el lanzamiento de OKNOTOK, la reedición de Ok Computer por su vigésimo aniversario, que se puso a la venta en junio. Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades."

The secret service always cock blocking you. when you're trying to run game on some foreign prime ministers daughter the news media catches you smiling at her and immediately blows shit out if proportion speculating that you are somehow breaking international law with your awkward teenage flirting, so you have to testify before congress that you didn't give away any top secret documents to her and are made to admit live on C-SPAN that you've never even kissed a girl . Then you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at you and flashing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to you while you were going through some airport or public event, and when you passed by and shook her hand she leans in whispering she is going to diddle her clit thinking about you tonight and how much she wants to suck your dick off, just to fuck with you. Then you try to look up some porn when you get home just to relieve the tension but you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies are watching you beat off. Then you finally break down and Jack off in the shower which sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock down until they can find the source of the specimen and you end up getting debriefed by the joint chiefs of staff about your masturbatory habits and how you almost created a national security issue with your dick. Then wikileaks leaks your search history showing you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait you'd accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about your supposed micro penis. So you end up squirming a little since you are so wound up and being judged constantly and now people are saying you look like a fucking mental patient and you start to think you'll never get any pussy. #YIAYfetish"

1306,"I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic"

1311,"I disagree that the B757 is showing age, the 767 flew before it and it's still in high transatlantic use. Plus they're fuel efficient, so there's no need. If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable. We can't drill oil forever, it's not sustainable"

1314,"Great and interesting video as normal :)."	
1315,"Erm...just an FYI as someone who lives in Scotland & flys down south to Cardiff and London at least 8 times a year, flying is MUUUUCH cheaper and faster than the train."	
1316,"I'm at the level of procrastination that I'm watching someone rate airplanes"	
1317,"Bombardier C-Series does all of this now and has the orders for them. Guess that's why Boeing is butthurt and putting out these videos."	
1318,"Everyone loves to complain about how uncomfortable planes are getting. Personally, I don't care. I don't ever make trans-continental flights, so sitting in an uncomfortable seat for a few hours isn't that big of a deal. And with the cost of tickets as they are I wouldn't be willing to pay more for a more comfortable experience. It's never been about the journey, just that I get there."	
1319,"Barely any airlines operate the majority of their routes with 787s tho"	
1320,"People are willing to pay more for greater speed or greater comfort... if they can afford it.  Wages have been flat for nearly a generation, so it's no wonder there isn't a huge market demanding supersonic flight.\n\nWhen I went to Hawaii I paid a little extra for a non-stop flight, and I'd have been willing to pay a little extra to make the trip in four hours instead of eight (oh my aching butt!).  But a supersonic flight, even if one had been available (it wasn't), wouldn't have cost *a little extra* but probably would have been *twice* as expensive, and I couldn't afford that.\n\nIf we want supersonic airliners, luxurious airliners, gigantic airliners, we need to get wages up.  If and when there is a market for such things, Boeing and Airbus and others will build them."	
1321,"The problem will be this. Even with this gap filled the concern is accessibility. Because unlike train or car or bus travel you can pretty much just get on and go and not to slog through piles of security theater. So until we realize this i think the other forms will be more dominant."

1329,"Correction needed: The Boeing 757-200 has a range of 4500 miles in a 200 seat configuration. The video states a 4000 mile range which is typical for the 757-300, but not for the 757-200."

1333,"the plane of the future........ I personally think it will be one where they put you to sleep simply so they can stack you on top of other passengers and pack people up like sardines simply for a larger profit , after all you cant complaint about your flight if you dont remember it right?"	
1334,"Your comments are very American and Wester European centric. The vast majority of future aircraft sales will be mostly in Asia since that's where the largest number of people live. In places like China and India which both have large populations and large surface areas, the more relevant point is one that you briefly touched on, namely the hyper loop. If that technology matures quickly, than it's far more likely that ere will be vast hyper loop networks rather than electric commuter aircraft. Also, why are you comparing aircraft with buses? They are completely on the opposite side of either an economic or technological discussion."	
1335,"I dont know how you made me watch the entire video while the topic is fucking boring as fuck, great job."	
1336,"Boeing boeing boeing...\nWill we ever even hear ONE compliment to airbus rather than praising boeing like a god."	
1337,"There are currently people talking about a possible Airbus A322 which would be a streteched A321 (more seat capacity) combined with an all new wing. This might be Airbus' answer to the MOM problem. The advantage would be a light and relatively cheap plane (compared to twin-aisle) and fleet-commonality with A319, A320 and A321 (minimizing extra-costs of sub-fleets). The disadvantage would be slower (de-)boarding, because of the single aisle and a tube-feel inside."	
1338,"Love the video! I love that you include the metric system things!"	
1339,"As I'm Japanese and living in Tokyo, frequently going to Osaka to see my friend, airplane's cheaper if you book it early. The bullet train doesn't have earlt discounted ticket like most of European countries do. And, the electric airplane sounds great but Tokyo-Osaka (Itami) route, JAL and ANA use B777-200, 300 or 787-9. 777-300 is configurated with about 500 seats. It's not like London Edinburgh. Japanese domestic flights are mostly operated by twin aisle aircrafts, so electric plane is pretty much impossible in capacity way."

1345,"Plane of the future will consist of one pilot and a Dog. The pilot feeds the dog,while the dog will make sure you touch the correct switches. That's automation for you."	
1346,"But why dont they just use the 787 to fill in that spot? Its fuel efficient, and has more seats than a 757."	
1347,"Just got off a 11 hour flight and planes need to get WAY faster... pls"	
1348,"Hyperloops will never be a real threat to planes in the future because we humans are destined to go to space, and between space and the ground there is the atmosphere, aka air, thus airplanes will be much more developped than hyperloops."	
1349,"Bio fuel not electric planes are the future!"	
1350,"besides competition is coming from comac (c919) & bombardier (cs-series) for the reigional market and airbus actually has something to fill in the gap, the a330 (albeit a bit too big) , and the a320 line sort of fit this gap, the range is fine but still shorter than the 757, and the capacity falls a bit short, the neo capacity is even worse\nthe thing about the 757 is that, the range and passenger ratio is just in-line (7000km~ with 220-240 pax), so its hard to replace\npeople might say the 767 is a replacement, the 200 yeah (250-290 pax), but they're also getting old and is still a bit too large, worse - the newer models are even bigger\nalso there is the A350-800 which could be a replacement, but ppl forgot that they can carry up to 440 pax, which in low demand routes doesnt make that much sense.\nso really the airline industry needed a single aisle plane on the 240-260 pax capacity with a range of over 7000km with an impressive fuel efficiency\ngod dammit boeing and airbus, shrink your planes\n\nother consideration is a possible combi type of plane, which 250~ is reserved for pax and the rest is for cargo, i mean that, on high demand times, could generate money, both from cargo and pax and thats a win-win in my eye\n\n\nidk why but everytime even on a supposedly non bias video there is a bias from the outside perspective of\nif it aint boeing i ain going"	
1351,"Electric planes?!? I believe biofuels are more likely. Not only does the technology exist, when fuel prices go up it will be able to compete with the cost. As biofuels become more used they will also drop in price. Battery technology isn't advanced enough."	
1352,"Actually, flying from Edinburgh to London is cheaper than the train (which are horrifically expensive in the UK now) - but people don't fly because the train can be quicker once you factor in airport security, waiting, etc and the fact that both airports are well outside their respective cities. People who fly tend to either be connecting in Heathrow, or live / work nearby. Working on the train is also more comfortable (a table the laptop fits on, power, wifi, decent coffee, etc for the entire journey)."	
1353,"Plane of the future is No plane. This is like 100 years ago somebody predicting bullockcart of the future."	
1354,"why no ads on the video?"	
1355,"Sure, planes are faster than trains - if you don't count the hour you have to be there before take-off and the travel time to the airport, which is usually out of the way and probably not even in your city (plus transit to your final destination)…\n\nFor travelling from western Germany to the south it takes me a total of ~4-4.5h total travel time when using the plane and 4-5h when using the train. When taking into account that the train is _considerably_ more comfortable (more leg room, free to walk around at all times, no changing transportation three times, no long waits, ) I just don't see air travel ever beating the rail unless it gets considerably cheaper (which probably won't happen, since any advantage in electric transport that improves ticket prices for planes is bound to also improve them for trains )."	
1356,"I'm surprised they still haven't utilized birdlike designs into their planes. Why constantly blast your engines for the entire duration of the flight when you can glide on flexible wings in between sustained bursts of propulsion?"	
1357,"They can't do super sonic because it damages the atmosphere"	
1358,"No matter how good it is, people in the United States still have to spend more than hours in the airport at security checkpoint."	
1359,"Hyperloop will never be a thing."	
1360,"Given the rising favour of electric powered transport compaired to combustion, there will have to be either a way to provide much more electricity than there is right now, or an extreme efficiency increase for electric, which at our state are both pretty unlikely. The UK is using about 90% of its electricity reserve and further strain will be put on it with just the electric car, so it makes you wonder if the future will be able to not run out of energy as it unfolds"	
1361,"I note this trend of planes spending so much time in the air that the _passengers_ are becoming increasingly interested in sleep.  Not the _crew	_ the _passengers._  I understand that planes are equipped to provide for the sleep needs of the pilot, the copilot, the navigator and the flight attendants, but what research is being done into providing for the sleep needs of _passengers?_  If we have a plane that is going to be in the air so long that there is no realistic way to ask a passenger to remain seated for the duration, and instead, it's more practical to provide them with _beds,_ can we foresee a day when this is a practical reality?"
1362,"I highly doubt electrification is achievable for flight (at anything past prototype) and even if it was it's doubtful it would be cheaper than avgas. Fossil fuels and nuclear power are the cheapest forms of dispatchable power we have. \n\nThat said, with a large nuclear power fleet, we can create synthgas from seawater, the US Navy research labs have already proven this technology (think refueling planes on an aircraft carrier). Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one. If oil price goes up synthgas will be able to make serious money with an installed fleet so large that it's not going anywhere fast."

1366,"British Airways operate the A319, A320, A321 and 767 from Edinburgh to London"	
1367,"Algae Biofuels can fully replace fossil fuels. Unless there's dramatic new battery technology I don't see the feasibility of electric only airplanes. Both the energy density and charging times would have to be exponentially increased."	
1368,"The energy density of jet fuel compared to batteries is around 100:1.  Until battery technology improves, this will be the major roadblock for large electric airplanes.  Lilium has a concept that might work for transporting people for shorter ranges."	
1369,"Some say that the planes of the future will already have skyscrapers attached..."	
1370,"I have a couple issues with this video.\nThe question is not how much oil we have left but how much of it we may still burn.\nIf we keep drilling for and burning fossile oil at the same rate right now it will very soon let the effects of it, specifically global warming exponentionally worsen. It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can’t ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least “green” energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don’t become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don’t think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later."

You have something special within you Estée! Thank you for always taking the opportunities you have to learn & grow & shed light on important matters.\n\nI've been taking a break too & it has been fucking amazing.

1691,"Glad to have you back!! I've loved your videos for years ☺️💓🌸"	
1692,"As a high school teacher - BREAKS ARE SO IMPORTANT! I could not continue to teach a new batch of kids the same content every year without time to re-charge and reevaluate my process. It's a process to mentally prepare and physically prepare the materials to tackle the new year with creativity and passion."	
1693,"San Francisco welcomes you! I am sure you will love this city and the vibes here."	
1694,"Estee! We love you becuz you are such an amazing girl. Funny , humble , lovely and really be yourself. I really love watching your video even just a normal your daily life. I really can't wait to watch the coming up Vlog that you will upload. \nWe always support you!!!!!"	
1695,"Ugh, I get so annoyed when people are asked where they wanna travel to and they say, Africa as if it's a country and not a continent. I know that may not have been your intention and maybe you don't know where in the continent of Africa you'd wanna do your safari trip but even saying, id love to visit some African countries and do a safari would be better. Africa is home to one third of the world's languages and within any given country you'll find vast tribes and cultures and traditions but you wouldn't know that because Africa is always diminished and regarded as one great nation to most of the western world. As a Ghanaian, it's so annoying"	
1696,"I actually discovered your channel while searching through pet adoption videos (I found that video when you and Aslan adopted Reggie!), and have been loving your videos/vlog channel ever since. I really enjoy how your branching out into current affairs and such! I mean, I could probably watch you boil water and you'd make it hilarious and interesting! But seriously, props on always making killer content! I want to also add that you are still as genuine and sincere as way back when you started your channel. Much love to you, Aslan, and Reggie<3 xxx oh and can't wait for the podcast!!!"	
1697,"I found you only this year. When I was researching getting a greyhound. Your vlogs about getting Reggie came up. I so love your personality and following your adventures and I'm about 15 years older than you. Glad you enjoys your break even more glad you are back! Oh and we did get a greyhound her name Pica and we will have a second in the next year or so."

1699,"Please domt take this the wrong way. Maybe its cuz you havent made a video in a while but you seem really nervous in this video. Your personality didnt shine through at all :("	
1700,"Clickbait title"	
1701,"This is what these scumbags feeds us and how it's #trending after 9/11...... these scumbags are flagging and blocking the real raw unreleased material these are facts......"	
1702,"If you have any questions on 9/11 that the government or media haven't covered. Please comment them below. I would love to see what us normal human beings from all around the world think, looking back to the tragic events we all saw. Peace & Love People, Have a great day :D"	
1703,"Aaa they didn't want to make it offensive...I see"	
1704,"I wonder how much it cost to redo, edit, and cut all of those scenes?"	
1705,"this is a coverup, lilo and stitch did 9/11 proof"	
1706,"Will they ever release the original?"	
1707,"Video by Lindsay Ellis\nIt's taken from one of the videos on her channel or did she actually work for Vox?\nIf it's the latter then damn....she's _really_ on a roll since she left Channel Awesome! Congrats for her!"	
1708,"Well that's really lame."	
1709,"How has no-one made an Lilo and Stitch 'ILUMINATI' comment yet?"	
1710,"pointless no need to cut it out"	
1711,"Should've disabled the comment section"	
1712,"Biggest cover up job on 9/11 mankind has ever seen."	
1713,"Omg vox what's up with the music 🙄🙄🙄"	
1714,"honestly though, having seen this movie a million times as a kid I would say that this edit actually serves the plot of the movie as at no other time is there a city environment shown in the film. I think it was an aesthetic change that was necessary in order to solidify the setting in which this movie takes place. Definitely freaky considering the date of the edit but I think it was just a coincidence."	
1715,"wow i did not know about the unreleased cut. very interesting"	
1716,"I think they should have kept it, as long as it didn't tease hitting a skyscraper. Even then I wouldnt be bothered but I see why the change happened, public would have got pissy about it"	
1717,"Get rid of the music. I can't hear anything from the movie."	
1718,"If this film came out one month before 9/11	\nAmerican theorists: OMG Lilo and Stitch predicted 9/11!"
1719,"Do anybody know? Did the planes got stuck in the building or went through the building? How did they managed to destroy the towers after the attack?(the authorities, how did they put the such huge buildings down with such little area without harming other buildings?) I always wondered"	
1720,"if the music weren't there this would've been a lot less depressing"	
1721,"Let me think of a 9/11 joke\n\n\n\n\n*%#=_= Error_101 i.s.n.t.1.2.y.r.s.o.l.d.t.h.u.s.d.o.e.s.n.t.m.a.k.e.m.e.m.e.s.o.n.s.t.u.f.f.t.h.a.t.h.ap.p.e.n.e.d.b.4.t.h.e.y.w.e.r.e.b.o.r.n"	
1722,"Is there a link where I can watch the original"	
1723,"This music does not match the video at all. Either let us hear the audio from the clips or just play some music, with text appearing in separate cuts.\n\nRight now, i could hear the music along with the audio from the clips, and the text change was often unnoticeable and occurred without warning."	
1724,"can you not man"	
1725,"just imagine if this movie came out before the attacks. Everyone would've thought that it's a part of some conspiracy or something"	
1726,"This one looks and sounds sad🙁"	
1727,"Vox: silent about how no airplanes crashed during the events of 9/11, \nbut manages to put out hard hitting journalism like this."	
1728,"Was it just me or the piano music was reaaaallly distracting?"	
1729,"RIP to those who lost their lives in 9/11."	
1730,"I think it was the music but this scared me"	
1731,"At least this change is justifiable unlike George Lucas changes to Star Wars he has no excuses."	
1732,"Out of respect shouldn't it had been stayed unreleased even now. why did you guys published it?"	
1733,"Love these short fact videos"	
1734,"Wow.  This is eerie and powerful..."	
1735,"Yeah if had been shown back then, conspiracy theorists would have been all over this.."	
1736,"This is sad the old scene would have been so much better"	
1737,"If the unreleased cut was released. Well, it certainly wouldn't have ended well for Disney. And maybe even childrens' minds..."	
1738,"This is actually kinda scary to watch really... it effected so many movies and cartoons..."	
1739,"the second one fits the story better anyways... so thank the American government for making this reality"	
1740,"Anyone know where I can find this song?"	
1741,"I kinda like the unreleased cut better. More tension, since its recondizably a 747, which are known to be unwieldy in a dog fight	 and its far more creative to have the plane curve off a building instead of just turn to the right."
1742,"This is chilling. Especially, at the End, seeing Stitch fall out after the cabin depressurization scene, and the memory of P.B. Lansing. It's still a sore topic in Hawaiian Aviation."	
1743,"The music makes it sound depressing...WHY YOU DO ME LIKE THAT"	
1744,"I'm just a typical person scrolling through 9/11 comments"	
1745,"This keeps getting shown every year"	
1746,"People making jokes about 9/11 is truly disgusting. Hundreds of people died for God's sake - have some respect."	
1747,"Wow! It is written my people perish for lack of knowledge. God bless"

2032,"so close to 1M bubz!! wooo"	
2033,"Hello Bubz Fam💗"	
2034,"Hi Bubz! I have watched you since before you were married and I am basically committed to watching your videos still, I love it so much! I'm sure you guys know what you're doing but due to my own past experiences i sort of became worried for Lala because my mom tried her best not to neglect my older brother and instead she neglected me. even giving me to my grandma really did some damage to me because i didn't know what a mother's love was supposed to be like growing up. Again, i think you guys know what you're doing and i only see glimpses of what goes on, through your videos. But please don't let ayla be removed from your presence for too long or she could feel disconnected with you, as to this day (been praying for God to restore my family) i have felt disconnected with my own family. please do keep me in prayer as well as you can see i need it, haha. anyway, it was a small worry, but i'm sure you guys know what you're doing, and i'm sorry if this came off the wrong way. God bless you and your beautiful family!!! Love youuu!! <3"	
2035,"lol! Isaac was obviously unimpressed throughout the Paw Patrol show. haha..."

2082,"I don't use my phone to run away from myself, I use it so I don't have to interact with others lol"	
2083,"Very nice message & some awesome animation & narration to go a long with it. Yeah this is a topic I think about a lot. In fact I made a little satire series called Strange Stories to kind of poke fun at how we function with all this advanced technology now."	
2084,"I love that this is posted on the day iPhone X's premiere was released. XD"	
2085,"Enjoy your freedom of thought before our phones literally become a part of us. I can see it now, silent obedience with just the snap of a finger."	
2086,"You say that like it's a bad thing... \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!"

2096,"problem isn't with phones but with ourselves. \nlike hello....move your ass a little around!!"	
2097,"My break from my phone is photography... granted, I listen to music via my phone, but at least I'm not still staring at it... and fuck off if you say my cameras a screen, I spend much more time looking around and through the view finder than at the screen"	
2098,"why did this video take such a dark turn... didnt expect a video about phones to be so morbid"	
2099,"can you the same things for books, youtube, knowledgable video ? plz explain . . . where the scattered knowledge come from . . . what is the right path to become knowledgable without addiction"	
2100,"I think in the future we will(or should) have classes in school that teach kids the pitfalls of technology and how to stay balanced with one's self in the information age.\nI for one make an active effort to keep balance in my life, even though I love technology and actually work with computers and phones(or maybe because of it). But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy."	
2101,"3:52 I bet you my life you didn't notice that double and in the translation. 😏"	
2102,"Anyone ever been to Lyon here ?! :)"	
2103,"I've had a GSM in the 90's, hated it and never got a mobile phone again, smart or otherwise. What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple.."	
2104,"That was a load of pseudo-intellectual babble.. Far below the standards I've gotten to used to expecting from this channel. \nShame."	
2105,"i managed to watch 1/3 of this before checking my email"	
2106,"This video sounds warm and believable, but in fact, it is wrong.\n\nBecause the problem is not with our phones, instead, it's with us.\n\nIt is like saying the problem with knifes: then, you say that it kill. While it does not kill, but it can be used to kill, also, it can be used for many purposes."	
2107,"Oh the irony since I'm watching this on my phone, probably more than 2/3rds or the comment section."	
2108,"1:10 - Scary how this described my current problem at the moment."	
2109,"Tl	dr: get off your phone because it's apparently blocking us from some kind of utopian future even though most of you are watching this on your phone\n\n\n\nI don't get it"
2110,"I'm having a hard time putting my finger on this one but something about the videos produced by these guys rubs me the wrong but I can not seem to articulate it.  But, I am getting the sense that I'm being preached to and I feel that many of the ideas that are being asserted should be debated.  Perhaps that is the point of the videos.....  at least I hope that is."	
2111,"Its not the technology, but the way people use it. A phone can be used to shoot a video for a project or to create music with creativity, or even draw a picture, which creates a platform to express yourself that anyone can access. Or it can be used as a crutch where you can't even think for yourself and rely on social media as a way to feel apart of something. We can't blame the corporations for profiting off the ignorance of the masses, thats just how human nature is. Its the job of people to elevate their own consciousness to become self aware enough to determine a life they want to live."	
2112,"Watching this sitting on the toilet taking a dump and reading the comments. :O"	
2113,"I don't see anything wrong with that. And I watching this video with my phone. Knowledge is the biggest enemy of the scammers"	
2114,"Same thing as blaming the gun for the murder.  The phone isn't the problem, you are.  If you decide to use your phone to look at pornography all day, that's your choice.  If you decide to use your phone to connect with your grandmother thousands of miles away, that's your choice.  If you can't learn to use the tool you have in your pocket in moderation, that's your choice."	
2115,"Good thing I'm using my phone to ignore everything in general."	
2116,"Irony of watching this video in a phone..!"	
2117,"I do not own a phone. I was asked what the time was once, by this human girl person, and I said	 I don't know, because I didn't know. The human girl person asked me if I didn't have a phone on me. I said no, because I didn't. She glared at me like I was personally insulting her by trying to fool her into thinking I had no phone.\n But yeah, I guess I can understand her mistrust...everyone nowadays has a phone..."
2118,"Bull\n5h17\nGo back to your secluded farm. In a way, I think it's more exciting to actually run a farm than playing FarmVille. Just be kind with the piglets."	
2119,"I have my phone on me but rarely get a call. Or text. Somewhat feel I need it on me but on occasions I leave behind.  I want technology to aid my life, get something from it rather than pointless time wasting."	
2120,"Listen to Arcade Fire's Everything Now album. We're addicted to this instant gratification our phones provide us. The more readily available something is, the less we value it. It's a dangerous game, and I think people need to wake up soon."	
2121,"42 second's in Nope this doesn't apply to me at all, I can quite happily live without my phone, its only use is to keep family/friends in contact other than that its not important to me, So nice generalizations at the start of the video"	
2122,"phone is like a kitchen knife, we can use for cooking or we can use for murder someone, the first thing we should to know is understanding about a phone itself and ourselves."	
2123,"To be honest I use my phone as something to express my thoughts, to develop my thoughts and to have a better understanding of things."	
2124,"This video dosen't make any sense. I use my phone all the time, and I've never felt anything u've told in this video."	
2125,"This video is nonsense"	
2126,"Rambles on about how we use our phone too much or incorrectly, only to sell us a link at the end of the video. Wat"	
2127,"I'm glad i grew up in the 90's without smart phones, and today I use my phone to answer, make calls and check my voicemail."	
2128,"with or without a phone I will spend all my free time indoors masturbating."	
2129,"school of life can we have more philosophy videos please? my life is disappointingly empty without them."	
2130,"They don''t keep a charge for more than 2 hours. Thats the problem with our phones."	
2131,"This guy's voice haha what the fuck"	
2132,"This dudes voice is so calming and the cartoons are so cool"	
2133,"I like the critique of smart-phones, but found this imagined future technology worse. Let's admit now what the ancient Greeks knew and told in their myths (and here we can include too the ancient Indians, Chinese and Japanese who knew and told likewise): often technologies and machines are just bad."	
2134,"I got rid of my social media and cut my cable off but now I just watch youtube constantly. I have to get a hobby or more of a social life so I can cut it out all together."	
2135,"Everybody laughed at the fat people from Wall-E. But that will be us soon."

2140,"I don't see how this is a new problem, my grandma used to go to a library to find information instead of consulting ourselves"	
2141,"Wow, that was a lot of big english words."

2290,"it's funny watching ppl defend Felix. the same ppl defending him would probably go apeshit if someone said faggot, but saying the n word is okay? yeah sure."	
2291,"its funny how he has been watching videos of stream fails and goes and does this"	
2292,"Most of people are retarded but journalists are the worst."	
2293,"From all what i see. Only the white ones are overreacting."	
2294,"It reminds me of the time when Maximillion Dood said it when he played For Honor, he got threatened and shed a few tears at the end of the explanation part. It's sad that small testicle fucks are STILL getting offended over one little word that should be dead now."	
2295,"Wow you always have the best shirts"	
2296,"I don't care for words\nI'm black\nand I'm cool with being called a nigger\n\nso what's the drama here?"	
2297,"Who gives a shit?  Hes pewdipie. Hes not important. I heard a homeless guy call me a N.... the other day, but he was crazy.."	
2298,"Lol free riding off controversy. Find good content dickhead"	
2299,"everyone tries to ruin him and is jealous of his success"	
2300,"Why do people even care?"	
2301,"not sure why anyone would defend something like this he droped the n-bomb so easily...to me he must say that shit all the time...how disgusting"	
2302,"Guys it's just a word, he didnt say fuck black People he just Said nigger."	
2303,"Hey what's up guys it's scarce here another shit video today"	
2304,"People say faggot all the time without any hatred toward gay people. Somebody says nigger once and they automatically hate black people? That's not alright at all, either hate all the words or hate none. I'm sick and tired of these drama whores holding one word above the rest when THEY don't even know why. It's not fair for one slip of the tongue to ruin a man's career.\n\nI understand pewdiepie didn't drop the N-word as a joke, but it's not like anybody says faggot as a joke either. The same people who hate pewdiepie for saying the N-word are willing to say faggot in a truly offensive way without any hatred towards the gay community and they fail to see the hypocrisy in that?\n\nIf you agree, thanks. If you disagree, why? And if you think the N-word is worse than the rest, fuck you. Thanks for reading, have a terrible fucking day."	
2305,"I find it ridiculous that PewDiePie is getting as much hate as he is for this. I don't even like him or his shows but this public outcry is stupid. He said a bad word as a slip of the tongue in a moment of anger. Get over it. I've heard people say worse in moments of anger. Yes, he is famous an we hold famous people to a higher standard. You hear far worse from the little kids on games like counter strike or call of duty.\n\nWorse has been said before this and worse will be said in the future. He is sorry. Get over it."	
2306,"How about you get a real job you shit stirring cunt? You are hungry for this shit to happen because you can't do anything besides dry humping drama stories for views."	
2307,"The amount of poeple who has said 'nigger' on youtube before is an unthinkable amount but just because he is the largest youtuber its a big racial deal because you all want to make money and views off having a rant at him, stfu and get over it you sad fucks"	
2308,"why such a big deal who the fuck cares"	
2309,"People are a bunch of bitches nowadays"	
2310,"natural disasters happen around the world : i sleep . pewdiepie says the n word : REAL SHIT"	
2311,"Not like pewdiepie is racist lol he really is. Do research he has made multiple slip ups like this."	
2312,"What word does the N word mean?"	
2313,"That word had to come from somewhere in his heart"	
2314,"DID U HEAR WHAT HE SAID"	
2315,"Not saying it was ok for him to drop the hard R but free speech is a thing."	
2316,"Oh my, look at all these hurt little babies getting offended over a slip. I'm sorry you had to witness someone vocalize the word nigger and had your feelings hurt."	
2317,"It's funny how only white morons got triggered by him saying the N word."	
2318,"Why don't you get attacked for saying faggot, yet nigger is so awful. They both have history. You where arrested if you were gay not long ago but no one cares about that. \n\nIddubz : either all swear words are banned or none of them. \n\nYou can't just hold nigger some much higher than any other. \n\nIt's just a word."	
2319,"Vanaman will be sued if he does that, and he will most definitely lose.  He could even lose his YouTube channel.  No one should underestimate Felix, it would be very foolish."	
2320,"I feel like this is just an excuse people are using to dog on Pewdiepie because they already disliked him. Yes, saying the N word is not a good thing and definitely a racial slur, but it doesnt seem as it was being used as one, just like how many popular streamers insult through a variety of ways. The people that are getting SUPER upset with him, probably did not like him in the first place and are using it as a way to attack him.\n\nOh well, I am just going to enjoy my popcorn :D"	
2321,"These ppl in the comment section are stupid, if the N word is an insult then why do other black dudes say it?? An insult is an insult... im coming from an indian background, and there has been a lot of memes recently which teased indians... but I kept quiet because I knew it was a joke and it was nothing serious... people should really try to understand whether or not the person ur talking to is serious or  not."	
2322,"Why is that word so taboo?"	
2323,"but Idubz can say it others don't trip?"	
2324,"It's not that he said nigger. It's that he used it as a synonym for asshole or something negative."	
2325,"It is just a word"	
2326,"Can't believe people actually spend their time watching drama videos like this. He said a bad word, why do you want to sit around and watch some dude talk about it? Lol"	
2327,"so much news, so much views for scarce, so much money ey?"	
2328,"Scarce is the epitome of faggotry"	
2329,"Why the fuck does anyone care?"	
2330,"You can hear pewd's voice waver after the word slips out. He says, 'Oh my God' not because hes mad, but because he knows hes in deep shit. He then laughs about it with Brad to cover up how dissapointed he is. I feel bad for Pewds. Everyone slips up..."	
2331,"PewDiePie I'm sure is at the point, and has enough money not to really give a shit what happens to him or youtube. He is set for life. PewDiePie is not crying somewhere in a corner."	
2332,"Ok, i really need to ask you guys somthing, and its no way meant to be racist. Why can black people call each other Nigga without its ment to be  a racist thing, but in the second a white person call a black person Nigga its suddenly racist as hell?"	
2333,"People need to calm their shit... end of story. People are whiney drama mongers."	
2334,"I'M STILL A BRO DONT WORRY 😂👏🏼"	
2335,"Why is saying it such a big deal? Ksi says it all the time but because he is black it isnt an issue..."	
2336,"Ppl shouldn't defend someone I see it as extremely offensive and I'm white"	
2337,"I think this was a stupid controversy"	
2338,"Listen to What A Fucking N*gger Pewdiepie by MollYxLogey #np on #SoundCloud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-838767421/what-a-fucking-ngger-pewdiepie"

2351,"And now Firewatch is under siege on Steam, receiving a lot of negative reviews. And this is also what social justice looks like. And I don't think they can individualize his DMCA, either no one can do it, or everybody can."	
2352,"Stop making it such a big deal, god damn. He said it at the Moment without even realizing it. And it wasn't even towards anyone, he said it to fucking pixels in a game. Jesus christ calm down."	
2353,"This is stupid so LMFAO.. Nigger, nigger, nigger... now what lol. I give pewdiepie the N word pass lmao. It's 2017 dude it's either you're racist or you're not. No one should care about a word anymore. It's not gonna stop me as a black person from sleeping at night."	
2354,"If I say nigga while I play pubg shall I apologize for that? NO! If I say Towelhead while I play pubg shall I apologize for that? NO! Ether all swear words are okay, or none of them are okay. And just because you say it while talking to the public, doesn't mean it's worse. The fanbase should could take that. When you stream you should be allowed to say all the swear words you can think of. So shut up with all that drama because of him saying one fucking word! You have all said nigga before, so it shouldn't be so much of a big deal.#Nigga"	
2355,"just shut the fuck up"

2402,"I wondered if you've read up on PMDD? It's similar to PMS but with more severe psychologic symptoms, it's something I've been researching and I've realised it's what I suffer from. As a person who also has anxiety and gets panic attacks it was quite difficult to make the link as I thought all of my symptoms were a combination of PMS and anxiety but through reading into it, it's obvious to me that that is what I have. Would love to see a video on how PMS makes you feel, more tips on how you deal with it and have us all have a chat about it in the comments because whether it be PMS or PMDD it can be very negative and lonely going through it. Ps, I love the new hair x"

2413,"I LOVE YOUR HAIR!!!"	
2414,"Genuinely love your hair, it really suits you!"	
2415,"keep the hair that YOU feel great with. the new haircut makes your face look a bit wider as it contours / highlights your cheek bones through the shorter fringe. in my very own, personal opinion i liked your lightly curled, very dark hair best, it made you look very seductive and grown up (in my very own, personal liking which you are in no way obliged to share or care about), which i love in other girls (as i am bi). still, you should choose your hairstyle the way you feel about it! -not that any hairstyle could change the fact youre a babe-"

2438,"Love your hair ah so amazing !!! Enjoy a different  Styles  girls go for it!"	
2439,"I'm kind of sad/confused because I saw a bunch of stuff about McGregor being really racist, and I would be sad to think that Mel supports that. Obviously I'm assuming you/Melanie didn't know about it because everything I've watched from her has led me to see her as a beautiful, accepting, hilarious, intelligent and talented individual. I was just really loving this video (and for quite a while her whole channel as well) up to that point, so seeing her give him a shoutout kind of caught me off guard. Maybe I'm getting biased info, but from what I''ve read he's a bigot... or at least not the man he appears to be from her description ... I hate that this is the first comment I've made on one of her videos, but I thought it was important. Side note: Please know that I love Melanie and all of her videos/work."

2604,"is this the new Injustice trailer?"	
2605,"only the raw producers could think it was a good idea to produce another coming soon series\n\nall it does is annoy fans after a couple of weeks.  then the fans end up blaming the wrestler out of frustration and taking a dislike to them before they've even debuted\n\nthey did it with darren young, the shooting stars, the cruiserweight division, emma(lina), bo dallas - when will they ever learn that an unexpected debut is always well received (e.g. bayley at battleground) whilst an advertised one spells disaster?"

2642,"They know everyone prefers Smackdown so in order to draw in more people to Raw, they decide to add the most dominant, popular, and unique female wrestler to Raw. They better let her keep, if not all, most of her moves. Her fighting style is refreshing to see."	
2643,"She will loose just like shinsuke did loose to jinder"	
2644,"Okay I love Asuka, I really do but I think going to the WWE is a HUGE mistake.  The WWE rules are different then NXT therefore then fans will not see her full potential like you saw her in NXT.  Also who the hell is going to the unbeaten Empress?

2890,"Hi sam! Loving your vlogs and baby. Just curious. Will you ever change your hair look? Like longer with big curls maybe? Im sure ull look lovely. Just a suggestion.."	
2891,"Btw, the only thing that matters is that you're educating Indie with LOVE and we all can see that in your vlogs. Doesn't matter what colours she wears."	
2892,"I am white and very pale and I never find the perfect shade either, all of them are too pink or too orage on me, so it's not only a problem for darker skin, it's a problem of the brands not being realistic while producing a foundation."	
2893,"i don't know where you are in The Handmaids Tale  but OMG! \nepisode 3? Nick the driver? ( faints)\ni've watched the entire season 3 \ntimes. \nthe series was updated quite a bit from the book, but Margaret Atwood was part of the re-write.\nshe even makes a cameo. \n\ntell us what you thought of the entire season when you're done...\nif you want.🙂"

2898,"Sammi you're seriously so pretty!! And sometimes I see indie and I wonder how drop dead gorgeous she will be when she's older, in a non creepy way ahaha she's just sooo cute! God bless her with her teeth coming in all at once must be so hard to handle for you both! All the best darling! So much love from Canada xoxo"

2903,"I am very pale and also always struggle to find the right shade!"	
2904,"I had to read The Handmaids Tale for a class. The book was so good and I have to get around to watching it to see any differences. I totally recommend that you still get around to reading it. 💛"	
2905,"Sammi you're doing a great job, I love how real you are. You're super hardworking and please know that the ones criticising you are in the minority. Why they're even on your channel I don't know?!"

2909,"Pleaseee where is your living room art prints from 😩😩💓 xx"	
2910,"It's not that you bought pink it's that it was in same video, I totally agree about bringing up your child to know about gender but that it doesn't limit you in what you want to do or achieve, my daughter had a little tikes garage and cars, toys should be universal and it's where people take gender roles too far either way thats a problem, being aware and wanting to make a difference for your child regardless of their gender is a powerful and important thing to do, xx"	
2911,"Pls dont do a voice over in the makeup tutorial :p"	
2912,"How can you avoid buying pink when most clothes for girls are pink? Of course, not all but most. If you see a nice pink dress, you can afford it, it's her size..., YOU BUY IT. If you see a nice blue shirt, you can afford it, it's her size...., buy it. GOD. Why are people complaining? lol (I believe I'm getting my POV out there)"

2915,"OMG HANDMAIDS TALE🙌🏼🙌🏼 I watched the whole season in a week. I found it all very interesting and captivating. Not too sure what part you're at so I will refrain from any accidental spoilers. Enjoy!"	
2916,"I love your makeup tutorials because you are very minimal like me so its gona be exciting to see what you do with the fenty makeup. Ive seen so many reviews already but they really caked it on. Thats fine i and i like the way it looks just not on me so this will be great! Love from America"	
2917,"Haven't watched in a while. So happy for you.💕💕💕"	
2918,"You should read the Handmaid's Tale!! So good!"	
2919,"You shouldn't make political comments if you are going to take offense at your viewers reactions. Seems to me like it's an easy stance to take and a rather old one at that. I'd like to think we are past the point of girls wear pink, boys wear blue, yada yada... Don't understand why you have even brought that up, like it was a thing."	
2920,"Indie literally has the most beautiful eyes. I'm SOOO JEALOUS"

2923,"Was it a layer of white fungus along the top? If so- likely mycelium, which doesn't harm your plant. Rather, fungi help the plant to take up nutrients from the soil more efficiently. It will grow when the soil stays wet for a prolonged period of time. Plant should have been salvageable- can always repot in new soil or clean up the fungal bits by hand :)"	
2924,"Indie is so cute she should be in ads 😍❤️❤️"	
2925,"The Handmaid's Tale is soooooo good. I read the book more than 10 years ago and loved it. The show is equaly amazing. Watched season 1 in 3 days. Just couldn't stop 😊"	
2926,"I love the way you do your eyeliner, so if you could add that to your tutorial 👌🏾😉"	
2927,"I'm probably the whitest person i know and i still to this day have a struggle finding the right shade foundation. There's a lot of light shades for white peeps out there but from my experience the undertones are too pink, yellow or literally white that it just looks weird on my face and compared to my body. I feel like people forget that white people don't all have the same skincolor or the same undertones. And if i do find the perfect shade by some miracle it freaking oxidises. Sooo now i just use concealers for foundation."	
2928,"I watched the promo for the handmaidens tale and boy I really want to watch it, looks so scary"	
2929,"feeling exactly the same about going back to gym after a long time"	
2930,"Does Indie watch tele every time she's home👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"	
2931,"Another Margaret Atwood adaptation is coming out on netflix called Alias Grace, definitely worth a read xx"	
2932,"You always look so stunning sam! ❤"	
2933,"Handmaid's Tale is sooo good, I watched it a couple of weeks ago. Can't wait for the next season"	
2934,"You have what it seems quite a fair complexion so I didn't think you found it hard to find foundation shades."	
2935,"Hey sammi where's your gold necklace from? You've probably mentioned before but obviously I didn't get it 🙈🙈 xxx"	
2936,"I loved the handmaids tale at the beginning but towards the end I was keen x"	
2937,"Where's your phone case form?! I love it!"	
2938,"Gym struggle is real! I procrastinated an 8 minute ab workout for hours yesterday and I constantly do this thing where i go back for the first time in ages, then I rest the next day cause I'm sore then I never go back 😂"	
2939,"All this gender rubbish is getting completely out of hand now. As a mother of a child who cannot yet make her own decisions you havr every right to dress her however you see fit. I'm a few years older and i cannot remember this ever being an issue when i was a kid. Parents dressed their kids in whatever they felt like. I had a Thomas the tank engine cardigan and postman pat jumper that i would happily wear when i was wearing a pretty frock. Many friends and relatives would have hand me down toys and clothes that weren't necessarily the 'right' gender for them. But they didn't care. Why? Because they were a damn kid and stuff like that didn't matter. If you're trying to force a teenage boy to wear a dress then that's another story. Sometimes things like clothes and toys are gendered. Get over it. Buy what you feel like."	
2940,"I watched that serie and i was in shock by the main idea of the serie and all the things happens to her 😱😱😱, but people need to watch it.\n❤️ u from Spain! 😘😘"	
2941,"You dont need to explain yourself when it comes to what color clothes you buy for your daughter, people need to fucking relax and worry about their own damn lives. You're a great mom."	
2942,"You are right. Trying to raise your child without gender id limitations doesn't mean you have to ignore her gender. I just means you don't push her into a traditional model of gender roles. I think you're doing a great job."	
2943,"The new couch with the plant looks so nice together. Glad you've got a new friend in the mix! It's so hard to meet good people.. meh - thanks for sharing Sam! xx"	
2944,"lol that shoddy Ocean Bells place is in Watford xD"	
2945,"I'm so excited to see your video on Fenty! My shopping cart looks JUST like yours lol! I got a sample of the foundation and I love it. I picked up the lip gloss and it's my most favorite ever, so comfy to wear and flattering."

2949,"Hi Sammi! I'm not sure if you'll see this but I'm about 4 months postpartum with my second and with my first I had a lot of postpartum depression and anxiety so I was determined to handle it better the next time around. I've been taking Evening Primrose Oil supplement (it's suppose to help regulate hormones) as well as a vitamin B complex supplement with my multivitamin and it has really helped me out. Also if it's a cloudy day and I can't get out in the sun I take a Vitamin D3 supplement. I hope this helps in any way. I know postpartum issues can be so debilitating and then having your life public for criticism must not make it any easier 😕 but I love your videos and have always admired your honestly!"	
2950,"Yes to makeup tutorials always love you doing them! And people need to calm down your human xx"	
2951,"I still love your beauty tutorials! I don't need you to be the best at makeup because I'm not the best either. I just love seeing you doing something creative and talking about how the products work for you. That trophy wife shade in the highlighter looks amazing on everyone of EVERY skin tone. It's so incredible!"	
2952,"Just watchin your video and thinking about your TATTOOS: how do you feel now about them (as a parent, adult etc)? Does your mind changed? Do you still want to add more on your body? How your point of view about your tattoos and tattoos in general has involved trought years? This is a video i would love to see on your channel! :) \n(sorry for english mistakes i am french) Have a nice day! Take care!"	
2953,"I love you girl ! Don't feel you need to explain yourself. Just let the people who want to pick everything you say proceed. You do you xxxxx"	
2954,"Yaaaayyy love your videos so so much! Always make a coffee for myself and enjoying:) by the way I'm soooo in love with your family and London ❤️🎉💋 have a nice day beautiful mamma"	
2955,"You hit the nail on the head with the whole gender neutral topic! As always Sammi rise above what others have to say, but you already know that 💕"	
2956,"8:40 was that alt j for a second? love them"	
2957,"Sammie, I was surprised that you didn't mention Fenty beauty like most people online (especially since you like Rihanna). I can't wait to see you wear it, and I love that you only show interest for brands you genuinely like xxx"	
2958,"What were the titles of the book u started reading?"	
2959,"I was hoping you'd demo Fenty for us. Love your hair like this!"	
2960,"I just don't understand how people can always misinterpret what you say. I feel like you always express yourself well, you make your point clearly and you're even overly cautions about the way you say things. And somehow people still misinterpret what you say and come up with their own conclusions. They aren't even listening to your reasoning, they only hear what they want to hear. Its so frustrating and also, who are these people?? I'm sure in real life they would agree with you in 5 seconds but on youtube they twist and turn everything. Honestly don't worry, there arenormal people watching your channel too, who completeley get what you're trying to say."	
2961,"I think the plant needs more air circulating around it to stop the moisture in the air from making it mouldy. Maybe put it near an open window sometimes. Ah lame comment"	
2962,"people need to remember that pink is trendy at the moment too, so of course, like yourself when you buy clothes you may be more likely to buy a pink item because its trendy. just a thought anyway."	
2963,"I loooove that dress on you! Looking good, girl! Oh, and I was obsessed with Handmaid's Tale. Like literally glued to the TV."	
2964,"Handmaids tale was intense! I finished it like 2weeks ago and overall it was so good but very disturbing. In today's day and age and as a woman watching this show was unsettling. They did such a good job at times I really felt like I was part of this universe and I didn't want to be!  but it's an interesting story and made me appreciate my freedom and rights. I'm curious to where it's gonna go in the next season. Let us know what you think of it when your done with it!"	
2965,"Hi Sammi, I completely agree with you about the gender color thing! I have three girls including a 1 yr old, and all three wear ALL colors including pink!"	
2966,"HERE ARE MY THOUGHTS!\n1. in response to what you said earlier: i fully trust you, your opinion on makeup and your makeup skills! i adore your tutorials and often finish watching the video having learnt something!\n2. Sam, I'm white myself and still unable to find the right shade LMAO\n3. i HAVE to start working out again, having graduated hs i have no excuses...\n4. FUN FACT: PINK used to represent the boys a couple centuries ago because it is stronger as a colour than blue!! And now it's a girl's colour... hell yeah.\n5. it annoys me how there are some people in our small community that always take your words out of proportion and assume whatever. you're always so clear with your opinions, what''s needed by us the viewers is sth as simple as logic. guess not everyone has that....\n6. I'M LOVING VLOGTEMBER!!!!! kisses xx"	
2967,"You say how difficult it is for Asian/tan/black girls to find their perfect shade and make it seem easy for white girls to get the perfect shade. I agree to an extent but as a Scottish pale skinned girl (super pale I may add) I've never found my perfect shade. I'm still having to mix two foundations to get a decent colour that somewhat matches me because I find everything is either too pink or yellow toned. It's wonderful that Fenty has created so many shades so that all of us can find something that is hopefully perfect. I shall definitely try it out!"	
2968,"How is this on trending?"	
2969,"Hi Sammi. I'm sure you'll never read this but I just wanted to say - you are doing such a good job being a mum! It is the hardest but most rewarding job in the world! My little boy was born about a month before Indie - it is so difficult! Don't beat yourself up about the little things. Xxx"

2986,"6:05 basically if you are not white you kind of struggle with makeup. False. I'm white and I can't find the right shade  of foundation for me. Drugstore and high end. I don't know why. That's why I only use concealer for almost 1.5 years. So please don't prejudice based on skin color. White or black. :) thanks"	
2987,"I love you Sammi, I'm a mommy too but there is one thing that I don't like about you- why do you ignore Indie's cry for long time? I understand that you're talking to the camera but please do a break and take care of your baby first :( listening as she's crying and you don't even look ar her is so sad for me. I personally as a mum too want to hug her because i do it when my little son cry ♥️ can you do that please? :( love you!"

3047,"Hey Steven and Andrew, love your content, and much love from Australia, glad you liked our seafood. I am hoping for a small difference in your videos though, i am not a content creator so i have zero idea what it would mean monetarily wise but if possible this is my hope. I love the idea and the locations and diversity of the food experiences etc you know what you do, but what i always find myself wanting more of is a bit of you and your partners in crime experiencing a little more of the locales than going straight to the eateries. Not to get all patriotic but Melbourne has been voted most livable city in the world 7 times running, i would have loved to have seen just a little more of you guys experiencing the location as i love your personalities before going straight to shots of happy eating faces. I know its the premise of the show but it seems such an effort to travel so far and not show any footage of you enjoying the actual location as well as the food. Love your personalities and enthusiasm, try an unusual activity everywhere you go before you get to eating :) #BuzzFeedVideo #Worthit # VIDEOFACT   Everyone wants to see more of you guys"	
3048,"Can buzzfeed not afford giving them both their own meal?"

3089,"Did you see that katy? I diagreed! Kek."	
3090,"NO Nick Fury ,, fought off Skrull off before he even meet Tony ,, this alll will be reviled in Captain Marvel  that would be a time based movie set in the pass before Iron man and Hulk and Avengers"

3092,"Michael, why/how are you in the audience of the Dave Chappelle Netflix special?"	
3093,"Catculator... that got me way too good"	
3094,"Your Marvel theory lacks X-Men. The Avengers are only separate in the movie universe because of the studio rights. Nick Fury knew there were super dudes and many x-men were avengers in the comics but can't be tied again due to rights. So realistically, just as in Deadpool where other x-men were referenced but not show because they couldn't afford rights for any major characters, there were plenty Superheroes in the world to justify the creation of the Avengers.... just not enough studio cooperation to do so lol"	
3095,"You forgot the best Friday the 13th film- Jason X"	
3096,"I love that Daniel pronounces Voldemort in that annoyingly correct way, instead of how the say it in the movies."	
3097,"What's in the box?"	
3098,"With the mcu time line there is a theory that Nick Fury is a clairvoyant so it would make sense that he knew all about Thor, The Hulk, and the New York attack so that's why he recuited Iron Man before any of that happened."	
3099,"Wtf is this shit? Lmao \nThis acting corny af! Like watching a group of retards act"	
3100,"Oh god. Thanks be to putting the originals back on. Gooooood job"	
3101,"Fury is not crazy:There were not just reports of The Hulk, the US military fought him and then he fought Abomination downtown. He already had Natasha and Clint on his payroll. All that was missing was Thor.Besides SHIELD probably knew about many others. Even so, the World Council knew about this, which would make them crazy too."	
3102,"Is no one going to mention the fact that Hawkeye, Black Widow, Ironman, Ant-Man, Technically captain marvel because her movie is set to be in the (90s or 80s), and presumably the hulk, is still an amazingly good team for the avengers initiative."	
3103,"I'm so glad she brought up the Friday the 13th timeline. I've always tried to pinpoint the years that are supposed to have passed between each film. Also, when she mentions the Evil Dead being part of the shared Universe, it should be noted that a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason was drafted that had Ash from Evil Dead fighting them both."	
3104,"I thought of the same thing Daniel did and asked the same thing. Fury wants to establish a response team to supernormal threats, but who is on his list? Romanov and Barton? 2 human SHIELD agents? Plus, he didn't even want Stark. He wanted Iron Man. So who is actually part of the Avengers Initiative?"	
3105,"Did you just say that the first Iron Man took place before World War II?"

3118,"Thank fuck it was the A team, am I right?"	
3119,"i think these all line up perfectly. so therefore. i win"	
3120,"The marvel one isn't valid. Fury new about the existence of Iron Man, Hulk, Ant Man, and potentially Captain America. Its also possible he knew about Black Panther (as seen how Wakanda is a highlighted region on Shield's map in Iron man 2). Apparently, he also new about Captain Marvel, which takes place in the 90s. \n\nThe point is he knew there were other super heroes in the world besides Iron Man and was likely planning to recruit any that he  could to be on the avengers."

3133,"I won't read this comment. What a Dick I am, I can't believe I just read this. I am pathetic!"	
3134,"Wow...everyone just shittin all over a beloved horror franchise lol"	
3135,"Wow. Even if we assume the After Hours guys only meet once a week, 80 episodes means they've been doing it less than 2 years... It feels longer."	
3136,"Ima be that guy. Agents of SHIELD showed that SHIELD had its eye on, and if I remember correctly locked up, plenty of super powered people. Its just that none of them ended up making the cut, which is pretty amazing because thor made the cut just by showing up and trying to kill cap and tony."	
3137,"Is After Hours usually this high def?"

3139,"I saw this on the trending page. I wasn't going to keep watching this until I saw Star in the background. RIP Sourcefed."

3141,"Fury knows about aliens cause of captain marvel"	
3142,"i disagree with the billions of dollars spent on the avengers initiative  because  they  didn't spend much at all tony payed for almost all of it"	
3143,"In agents of shield...I know I know. SHIELD already knows about the kree and the inhumans so...avengers needed?"	
3144,"Im in love with all but one of them. I wont say who. \n\nThat would be awkward."	
3145,"This pretty much confirms for me that Fury learns about Skrulls in the 1990s (Capt. Marvel movie), and waits until someone pops up (e.g. Iron Man) to start an initiative towards fighting them."	
3146,"Dark Knight Rises should be on here if it's not. Honestly don't know how Bruce Wayne got back to Gotham after the prison escape so quickly."

3149,"8:15 the only reason youre here. thank me later"	
3150,"Someone must have not remembered the avengers!!! They started the avengers in the movie avengers. The team was an idea before that movie as a fail safe but was never formed. The government had shut it down before it was formed as said in the movie and only was formed becauce of Loki. Annnnnnd they already knew of super powered beings from the hulk having existed well before iron man 1, ant man existed, and captain America existed (and was frozen unbeknownst) so they had an idea to find super powered beings around the world and get them on the side of good knowing that the odds that all super beings being friendly is super low. They then went out in search from the start of iron man until the avengers creating a superbeing archive of names and people that were super powered to decide if they are good or bad and then create a fail safe using the good super beings. Then Loki strikes and Thor comes and that's when nick fury reaches out to all those archived super heroes to create the avengers in said movie."

3153,"Nick fury in the comics had resources that are literally outta of this world. He is the man behind the wall fighting off monsters before they become a problem. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a way to get to Asgard or figured out Iron man's identity. PLus he is good at improvising."

3165,"i get it that nobody cares about the extended universe of ANY franchise, but SHIELD did have the guest house alien for a while"	
3166,"I think something that would help me like the new cast more would be to make twice as many of both sets."	
3167,"Thank god the original cast is back."	
3168,"Well John Doe could have decided in advance that Envy was his sin, and that he wanted Rage to be the guy who kills him. Part of his manifesto is that the whole world is corrupt, that the victims are not that particularly chosen, but that it could be anyone. It would probably be a big thing for him that mostly anyone could be driven to kill in rage if you push them the right way. He could have decided to use Mills for Rage during their chase, that's why he spares his life, he's like yesss, this one will do.. and starts planning how he can get envious at him and drive him to killing."

3193,"Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others don’t? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities?"	
3194,"Israel....Separate yourselves away from the Wicked..,from the ways of the Nations that have swallowed you up...or share in reaping what they have sown....\n\nProverbs 11:21\nTHOUGH HAND JOIN IN HAND  , the WICKED shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.\n\nJeremiah 23:19\n9Behold, A WHIRLWIND OF THE LORD IS GONE FORTH IN FURY, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. \n\n20The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: IN THE LATTER DAYS YE SHALL CONSIDER IT PERFECTLY."

Just like you work hard for yours, they worked hard for theirs. Just giving yourselves reasons to be stingy and lazy."

Just look into their eyes.... they do not give a shit... they would kill you and eat you for dinner just to be trendy in a second. They disgust me... anything they do disgusts me. Using this tragedy orchestrated and allowed by the government in order to punish Trump and spew race based GARBAGE and get off on themselves as if they are actually DOING someting>>>> they make me want to VOMIT RIGHT IN THEIR FACES! They are not taking calls on those phones... its all fake its all phony! We are on to your sick mind games."	
3208,"All the celebrities should join together and help the hurricane tragic damages. The people have supported and help them become famous they need to put their money where their mouth is. The people don't want to see or hear stupid ass shows. This show probably took a lot of money to set up the funds should go to Houston."

3213,"Do not ever give money to events like this!! Very little money if any goes to the victims"	
3214,"If celebrities, business owners and VIPs involved donated $100k each you would reach the goal hours ago.  Donald Trump donated $1 Million, the Kardashian Family 500k.  Also I really really really hope the money goes to the victims not an organization or government."

3225,"nobody made a joke about trump or called him out ?? WOOOOOOOOW i cant belive it"	
3226,"Look up HAARP my friends, and the real question that these celebrities need to be asking. Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

3373,"You need to drink a lot of water, ‘cause there’s so many pimples on your forehead or probably you use a wrong scrub? 🤔"

3388,"Her reaction annoyed me so much 😡 instead of listening she doing weird reactions gosh"	
3389,"He's so lucid an woke, and that's great. The only thing to worry about is that he's talking from the point of view of someone who is lost. He thinks he's doomed. Maybe he did something really bad in the past."	
3390,"People think this man is crazy because he's telling you guys there's no meaning to bullshiticons fairytale stories we are collateral damageand the quest for world domination"	
3391,"Love how that woman just habitually shoots down any opinions that aren't hers"	
3392,"I'm on board with JC. He's not crazy, go fuck yourself."	
3393,"I'll have to try the tetrahedron defence if I ever wind up in court."	
3394,"Jim is actually acting ridiculous here to express his point!\nThat's why he fades in Hollywood, he is pursuing something more spiritual.\nWe can sense that since he got the beard"	
3395,"Jim is a weird in his own way which is awesome but we do matter and it is our earth given to us"	
3396,"This is called Depression"	
3397,"Only few people made change but most of then made money."	
3398,"He's right though we don't matter or things would be different.\nWay 2 stick it 2 THEMAN"	
3399,"If you call out the bullshit, Youre crazy. \n\nNothing matters. Only love"	
3400,"To be honest I don't blame him, he's been through so much the last  few years. He is just seeing things on a different conscious level"	
3401,"Thats another one of Hollwoods greats gone to shit. What the hell happened to him :("	
3402,"Jim knows things most don't."	
3403,"Glorious interview. This is a man that knows how to be on fire."	
3404,"The reporter takes it as a joke, but he's dead-serious about what he said"	
3405,"Fuck E! Jim Carrey over E! And it's shitty shows any day of the week."	
3406,"Okay Jim Carrey if nothing matters GIVE ME YOUR MILLIONS"	
3407,"I love Jim. I'd like to think the reporter was just taken aback by his response, and was not trying to be rude. Even if she agreed with his thoughts about Hollywood being meaningless she would probably lose her job if she openly agreed."	
3408,"You know you are deep into the shithole when you need an overrated, exagerated celebrity to tell you what the rest of us have known forever. Also, next to an E reporter, even this asshole looks deep and mystic."	
3409,"He's on another level. He's fucking awesome."	
3410,"i get what hes saying and i back him but he obviously cares enough to show up and dress up for it. seems like hes trying to be the too cool guy."	
3411,"I agree to with the point we don't matter"	
3412,"The fact that he's right.... frightens me."	
3413,"jim carrey lost it, became a boring socialist hippy"	
3414,"It's not entirely stupid actually .. that We are a field of energy dancing for itself might be a very accurate description of reality. A lil meta tho ..."	
3415,"Jim carrey is the man,  icon is sucks"	
3416,"Truth bombs, love it .We're all just farts in the wind"	
3417,"Good words from a person that lives it"	
3418,"FINALLY. ... Someone puts Fashion where it deserves to be. ... MEANINGLESS is an understatement. ... Fashion is a Giant Wheel of Pretentious Horseshit spun by worthless pretentious ASSHOLES."	
3419,"I could listen to everything he has on mind the whole day and night."	
3420,"I don't mean to be rude here but I think the only thing the New reporter should be focusing on it her greasy hair. Can't stand news reporters like these ^."	
3421,"If true happiness exists it should reflect the limitless void. There is nothing in me, and in you."	
3422,"Jim Carrey has been on a spiritual search for decades. He's likely by now had some significant breakthroughs - some aha moments. When that occurs, much of what was once considered significant is revealed to be trivial. And it can look EXACTLY like mental illness. When, in fact, it might be he's the only sane one in the whole bunch. All that glitters is not gold."	
3423,"Holy crap he's old"	
3424,"knowing that nothing matters is a way for depressed people feel purposeful"	
3425,"You retards realise this is her job right? Just because it's a shitty job doesn't mean she is going to disrespect it. \n\nWhen you people get a job one day maybe you will understand that people like her probably can't afford to ruin her career by going along with him carrey's fuck it attitude"	
3426,"He's been watching too much Rick and Morty..."	
3427,"Jim Carrey goes through his teenager existential phase late."	
3428,"Yes we are a field of energy as we make energy and use it....  Cars make energy... Yet they charge us to use them lol Fuel slaves... Yes we make the energy that runs the world and they charge us... Cars don't need gas that's why gas evaporates"	
3429,"Jim:*makes introspective deep philosophical speech on how everything is meaningless\nReporter. But your wearing a suit"	
3430,"This is a reasonably creative Stella Artois commercial"	
3431,"There have been people concerned that Jim Carrey is losing it or has become jaded, but the truth of the matter is much more simple:  He chose the wrong place to trip on psylocybin (magic) mushrooms.  Look at his past inspirational musings, how he focused on the smells mid-conversation, and then started to explain reality as though he were not part of it.  If it wasn't mushrooms then it was something else altering his perception.  Given his inflated stature (celebrity) and how public his life is, I genuinely hope he sticks to the safe drugs like DMT, mushrooms, and cannabis."	
3432,"He needs to be the next Green Goblin!"	
3433,"Jim is so awesome! He is embracing what many know yet are scared to articulate. His trips in the forest have placed him on a plane unconstrained by the constructs of society. I have no doubt that this man will inspire a following of similar thinkers. Reminds me a lot of the philosophy, absurdism. And as any great absurdist would say, Nothing matters! We should embrace it."	
3434,"I grew up on Jim Carrey but he is a colossal piece of shit, we will be reading about him killing himself in the next few years."	
3435,"So if he's too cool for school, why is he there?? And where does he get off standing behind her and touching her like that. This makes me think he's a creep. She's just doing her job, decline the interviw."	
3436,"Too clever for E! and its regular viewers to ever fathom XD"	
3437,"That bitch is acting like WTF is he saying but he is just saying true."	
3438,"The emporer had no clothes...but he is wearing a cool jacket."	
3439,"This man's message woke me up."	
3440,"EVERYONE: Jim is has been taking a shit ton of mushrooms to prepare for his role as Terrance McKenna and it seems he's actually waking up to a lot of his philosophy."	
3441,"This reporter is annoying as fuck"	
3442,"Jim just find the true."	
3443,"too much Twin Peaks. I can dig it"	
3444,"There is only so much you can fake.\n\nJim's tired of the fakeness around him, and he'll gladly lay it all down. You either open your ears or continue to close your eyes."	
3445,"I want the same drugs that Jims got."	
3446,"he's the only sane person at this event."	
3447,"lol now that was a crack up and he was on point lol."	
3448,"Jims a legend when the media attack people this is what happens and he's saying the truth"	
3449,"He has totally lost it."	
3450,"Do your research on the effects of television and who controls the television stations. 6 years ago I through my TV in the trash and haven't looked back. If you're still watching TV, you're being systematically dumbed-down."	
3451,"that reporter is so superficial and dumb"	
3452,"What he said is so vague that people in the comments are just filling in the blanks with their own projections of conspiratorial mindsets. I think the real people being trolled are right here in the comments."	
3453,"He's not crazy. He's able to see through the fakes and what really is important to him without caring what people say. Unfortunately, it's a lesson we learn much too late in our lives."	
3454,"Damnnnn Jim's on the non duality tip"	
3455,"Kekistani Ministry of Culture supports this man."	
3456,"His my hero rn , its nice to know im not alone"	
3457,"He looks like he's really sick and tired of not just Hollywood, but of the world we live in. That makes us 2, heh."	
3458,"I just spent the last 30 mins researching tetrahedrons thanks to this man"	
3459,"What does he truly believe, i need a little insight here thanks!\nI still think it's nihilism, but i'm not 100 percent sure"	
3460,"Didn't expect an existential discussion on the nonexistence of the self and the illusion of the ego at Fashion Week, did she?"	
3461,"E! You have the nerve to say he sounded off?? Jim Carrey has always thought like that,people just didn't pay attention,they got distracted with his Talent to make people Laugh."	
3462,"''I don't care, we don't matter and that's a good news'' Jim :D"	
3463,"Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind\nPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time\nAll day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy\nThink I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify\nCan you help me, occupy my brain?\n\nOh yeah\nI need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find\nI can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind\n\nMake a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry\nHappiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal\nAnd so as you hear these words telling you now of my state\nI tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late 🎶"

3477,"just"	
3478,"WOKE!"

3485,"Jim Carrey woke af"	
3486,"jim buddy.. whats goin on?"	
3487,"Someone has been reading Descartes."	
3488,"Jim, stop being so hypocritical and talk about video games please."	
3489,"Says pewdiepie is wrong for coarse language, is nick-named Jim F-word Sterling."	
3490,"If you are somehow upset by someone saying a negative word and you do not also refrain from saying literally anything negative at any point in time, you're inconsistent. Worst of all you're an irrational person. There's no way to logically say any one word is in reality any worse than any other word."	
3491,"That reminds me a lot of Wargaming vs SirFoch but on a greater scale of sorts. There were money, here is just spite."	
3492,"Avatar! YouTube is your friend, your provider, and your master!"	
3493,"so pewdiepie said something some people didn't like and you got mad over it? i'm not behind you on this one. you insult and use quite the colourful vocabulary yourself.    \nwords are not racist, intentions are. kraut, spaghetti and other inventive racial slurs are not racist by themselves.   \nthe other dudes are criminals but using coarse language isn't."	
3494,"so I saw the pewdiepie video from stream, and I was not surprised at all again, that this is again situation that tabloids are pushing to extreme to generate views. /sight"	
3495,"There is actual harm caused by people encouraging children to gamble and scamming.\nSaying a naughty word harms no one. Maybe it will give advertisers another excuse to extort things from google, but it's going to be an excuse, not a reason."	
3496,"Jim states that there's no precedent for Fair Use on Youtube, but I think that H3H3's recent win would count for setting a new Fair Use precedent, yea? At least that would be State court, assuming there probably isn't any precedent at the appeals or Federal level."	
3497,"Hunker down People the Age of Ad-Tron has begun"	
3498,"regarding to pewdiepie situation - this is some political correctness bullshit. you blame him for all adpocalypsis which is not fair. there are shitload of youtubers who say very bad words on stream, yes he is the top streamer so he should have not said it but Jim, wtf you saying?"	
3499,"what about doing video's for fun and get real job"	
3500,"Thanks for keeping up the good fight!"	
3501,"I've never liked PDP, I just don't get the draw. That being said, I find myself for some reason having to defend him not because I support racial slurs, but because of the MASSIVE double standard regarding them and the outright abuse of the DMCA in response to it. \n     The fact of the matter is that the DMCA was written BY monolithic corporations FOR monolithic corporations and they repeatedly misuse it with little concern of negative consequences since it is stacked so unbelievably in their favor. \n    Could this be used to destroy what we know of as Fair Use? Yeah, it could, but ultimately I see that as the force that would finally take DOWN the DMCA as we know it. \n    Europe has much more restrictive ideas of 'Free Speech' than here in the States, and it is true that it's not a free speech issue, legally, when it's solely in the hands of a private corporation (even IF said corporation HOSTS an UNBELIEVABLE amount of speech). But the day the US government comes to censor, and let's be honest that's what 'regulation' means in this context, there will be hell because THAT is a Constitutional violation on our side of the pond."	
3502,"Well now we know Jim watches The Young Turks....sigh..."	
3503,"While the president will be set in regards to the worst, then maybe point out the worst. Comparing scaming kids to using bad words is kinda stupid..."	
3504,"shit like this is why I love you Jhim"	
3505,"Why does this have so many dislikes? He's right. We know Pewdiepie isn't racist, but what he said was fucked up. He's got to be more responsible as the face of a platform."	
3506,"Also, this has to be the worst rated Jimquisition in a long time."	
3507,"Either everyone can say it or no one can say it."	
3508,"Didn't Pewdiepie say what he did on Twitch though? I've not been paying much attention to this shitshow."	
3509,"What fucking scumbags...\n\nIt's sad that hell doesn't exists.\nIt's sad karma doesn't exist.\n\nWhich means we can only hope they get hit by a car or something."	
3510,"Usually totally with you Jim, but you can fuck right off with the N-word thing. You don't want to say the word then fine, but don't talk about it, and don't go putting the word in my head and making me think it. If you want to talk about it then man up and take some responsibility for what you're talking about."	
3511,"Pewdiepie is a coward, and it's no surprise a junkless coward would use that word in the comfort of his isolation bubble, but would never say that word around, you know, actual black people/white people/asian people/insert any race you would like here who might take offense, who would leave him in the gutter for his trouble.  Typical."	
3512,"Pewdiepie deserves the tikki torches but Kanye will get an emmy for using the same word. How do you justify the double standard, is it racism of low expectations where black people are given license to freak out disproportionately to the use of a single word? If it's so offensive, are you or anyone else, going to boycott the hundreds of music artists who use the word constantly, because we are all in the same garden afterall, right?\n\nYou think pewdiepie is responsible for the ad-poclaypse? He was just the catalyst to shift youtube into a television model because that's all corporations know, you even acknowledge they are act like a network. You think you are family friendly enough to stay the axe? Better invest in a bleep machine\n\nYou have this outlandish personality, but then act like a moral busybody christian crusader as soon as your feathers get ruffled"	
3513,"The only truthful thing to come out of PewDiePie's recent apology was that he never learns from these controversies and that he was a huge idiot. He'll be doing something just as stupid if not more next week."	
3514,"Don't know whether to like the video due to Jim's stance on Tmartn and ProSyndicate or dislike the video due to Jim's stance on Pewdiepie. Decisions, decisions..."	
3515,"I don't think many people put enough effort to comprehend what they're commenting on... and it includes both sides - PDP defenders AS WELL AS his recent critics. Apart from some percent of brainless radical racist idiots, I think most of us agree that the N-word is infamous for a reason - it has a horrible background history and hateful meaning. But for some time now it's also been used in a wide variety of contexts that extend far outside of this word's common definition. \n\nAnd what actually is offensive about it is not the word itself but the context behind it. It became a common sense thing to just not use it to avoid confusion and stop any possible abuse coming from using it. Hence, PDP slipping it out was a really stupid example of lack of self-control where it clearly should step in on literally every word he's saying (considering his non deniable influence on many people). But when you look at the situation he was in and examine the moment of the commented reaction it becomes more and more doubtful if this word in this particular moment had a true racist context. it was clearly offensive and insulting towards the PUBG player but not really that racist in general. \nThus PDP should be smacked for using the word but calling him straight up racist is just an example of reckless hate bandwagon causing the drama to be more exposed than the actual bad word itself.\n\nPeople should be educated why this word is an abuse and why it shouldn't be ever used. All this drama consisting of people actually only throwing insults at PDP is showing that what matters are pitchforks and torches, especially in 'mass vs 1' setting, leaving educational aspect far behind hardly justified rage."	
3516,"Yeah fuck those guys. I'd never dupe my audience (all 12 of them) YOU MY BROS, BROS."	
3517,"So let me get this straight people are now advocating for Peer Pressure? But I thought Peer Pressure was a bad thing."	
3518,"This video would have been so much better done by Rory Fingers."	
3519,"Damn, i always hated Psysindicate, but just because hes videos a boring and he talks like he had a seizure, now i have a real reason to hate him!:D"	
3520,"It's because of socialist shit like your criticism of pewdiepie saying nigga why the ad apocalypse is actually happening."	
3521,"13:51 so using the N-word in the heat of the moment and immediately apologizing for it, is racist.\nBy your own logic, you must be one of the biggest misogynists on this website for your overuse of the word C...Skeleton Warriors\n\nCome on"	
3522,"What is a CSGO?"	
3523,"Your vids like this should be mandatory viewing for all YouTube creators haha"	
3524,"YouTube isn't censoring or taking away ad revenue from videos because of people saying nibba, it's because they are trying to suppress dissident views."	
3525,"I'm considered a right cynical bastard by most of my mates, and even I almost choked on all the sarcasm. \n\nThank God for you, Jim Sterling. Thank God for you. :D\n\n***edited for spelling"	
3526,"...well that went off the fucking rails."	
3527,"The most cutting piece of satire in this video was when you didn't convert pounds at all to make them dollars."	
3528,"That jackass Pewdiepie now has legions of basement-dwelling edgelords and tough guy 12 year olds typing racial slurs on every gaming news video like some kind of self-fulfilling ad-pocalypse prophesy."	
3529,"Pewdiepie's apology video seemed pretty sincere. More than you can say for Tmartn and the other guys in the video at least."	
3530,"Looks like butthurt fanboys didn't like this video much..."	
3531,"Nowhere does jim defend the dmca takedown\n\nSo stop being outraged you racist brietbart reading fuckwit snowflakes being upset when someone calls out pewdiepie for being a piece of shit"	
3532,"YouTube's already fucked.  Google's going to further tighten who gets to make content.  PewDiePie and his ilk is going to take the whole service into the shitter, and it might be best to start looking at Twitch, VidMe and Smashcast, then hope to God those services' overlords aren't as enamoured with automation as Google is."	
3533,"Not sure of the point of the video. The overlap of people who are supporting these CS-lotto guys and also watch Jimquisition is probably about zero."	
3534,"Not going to lie, the first part of the episode was not one of your strongest. The second half was good tho"	
3535,"love how most of you tards skipped right pass 90% of this video and went straight to dick riding pdp. lol"	
3536,"Wow thats amazing that this had no consequence for the csgo lotto boys .."	
3537,"Aydinpaladin did a fantastic video on you, regarding this topic, jimmy boy. Then again, she always does fantastic videos since she has a degree in social sciences, and you have......well, she has a degree in social sciences. Oh but wait, you can't defend yourself because she's a woman, and that would spoil your narrative. Well. I'm sorry Jimmy Stanton. It must be a real bummer being wrong so often."	
3538,"I agree the response from Santo Campo is worrying.  If regulation does come to Youtube, then everyone is fucked.  It'll not just be PDP's fault, it'll also be the fault of every game dev that decided to hit someone with a false DMCA because they didn't like what a Youtuber said.  Santo Campo is the straw that broke the camel's back, but people won't remember it that way.  No, they'll only look at PDP and lay the blame solely at his feet."	
3539,"A little bit offtopic, H3H3 actually just won a lawsuit for fair use."	
3540,"You know what happens when you say that word (in the context that PDP did) on TV, or radio, or at your retail job? Your ass is fired on the spot and you are likely blacklisted forever. Just a word, my ass."	
3541,"Would it shock anyone that Pewdiepie has actually increased his subscriber numbers by nearly 20,000 since this went public? He is at 57,262,882 subscribers as of now. Not even the mainstream media could destroy his channel, after the WSJ attacked him, he gained over 10million new subs."	
3542,"Honestly, this the first Jim Sterling video I actually disliked (Part of at least). PewDiePie says the N-word on a stream in the heat of the moment (apologized right after) and gets blasted for it. It was wrong on his part and he deserves some flak. But punishment, like what law did he break to make him a criminal. Youtube already cut ties with him as did MakerStudios. Meanwhile, I watch a EtikaWorldNetwork (FYI, He's Black) stream and he saying the N-word all over the place. He jokingly uses the N-word, but also says it in the heat of the moment. Why don't ppl loose their shit over that? Or is it because he's black that he gets a pass? No. It's simply, because PDP is the largest Youtuber, no other reason whatsoever."	
3543,"It was funny for the first four and a half minutes but then you were just beating a dead horse."	
3544,"Our first celebrity meltdown on YouTube, this one is on the same level as Mel Gibson."	
3545,"Damn, the sarcasm is over 9000"	
3546,"I'm curious about what you think of PewDiePie's recent apology."	
3547,"Is it just me or are a lot of You tuber's influenced by the con man that used to knock on your door and attempt to sell you something dodgy?"	
3548,"How the wet FUCK does Jim not have at least a million subs???"	
3549,"Oh god, Pewdiepie is the Trump of Youtube."	
3550,"I had no idea that so much sarcasm could be piled into 15 minutes."	
3551,"Can you just not fuck it? is applicable to pretty much anything online"	
3552,"To all of you guys crying about freedom of speech and censorship, understand this: \nLike people who affiliate mob, shaking hands with the devil to get a piece of the action is an agreement to not become a liability in their eyes. Doesn't matter if anyone outside of the corporate circle agrees or not. Only difference is, if you act a fool on YouTube you lose revenue and videos, but if you act a fool while working with the mob you'll get cement shoes or a visqueen sleeping bag. Either way, when you become a content creator you become YouTube's bitch."	
3553,"This was idiotic.   You could not be more wrong about the situation.\nMoronic!"	
3554,"I find that anyone that calls him Pewds can safely be ignored. Especially when they claim to not be a fan, yet still manage to defend him. Nobody just accidentally says a word without it already being a word they use. The only slip up happening was he got caught saying it live."

3559,"Honestly, Pewdiepie using the N word is just silly for him to do. Regardless of your personal beliefs about PC culture, we don't use racial slurs for anyone except with the privacy of our own friendship circles that have deemed it okay. Pewdiepie is a youtuber, it's his job. He streams, and makes videos. When he's livestreaming, he is on the job no matter how cool or freeform the job. \nYou do not say that word when you are at your work. Period. Try to apply your arguments to your mum and see how it works for you.\n\nAnd beyond that, if you are so against the N word being considered a racial slur, then advocate for it in a manner with a legitimate argument. Don't go just saying it for the sakes of saying it."	
3560,"I fully agree on the Pdp part.\nEither YouTube regulates itself, for example enforcing their community guidelines or just making use of laws, or, and in my opinion more likely, the current YouTube will fail.\n\nAs for why enforcing some guidelines is important:\nIf the CEO of some minor company, let me take Tim Cook as an example because he is in the media from time to time, were to swear on a press conference. The entirety of the Apple shareholders would demand him to step down. Not because the word used was bad, but because his behaviour is inappropriate. Companies working with Apple would be happy as their business partner has some standards and move on.\nOn Youtube however, advertisers (business parterns of Google) see no actions at all! Working with a company that has no standards is to be avoided, or else your shareholders, customers and business parterns will give up on you.\n\nAnother issue is the audience of said channels. They are young and do not know any better. Guess how we got all the screaming and swearing children in voice channels.\nTheir idol is screaming and swearing all the time! It is logical to them to behave the same. The sterotypical 12 year old is co-produced of YouTube not regulating anything. Laissez-faire has failed years ago.\n\nNow that the waves get higher, we see the storm comming."

3611,"Oh Alex, is this your excuse for when Trump actually got into office he started to behave just like all the other (s)elected US presidents? Are you saying that all his backtracks on foreign policy are because he's being drugged through his favorite beverages? \n\nCause it must be some powerful stuff if it makes you sell arms to brutal regimes, illegally bomb nations and generally do a 180 on all the promises made in the run up to the election. \n\nAlex you are controlled opposition	 maybe not always but somewhere down the line they turned you and this has been painfully evident in the recent months."

3705,"Originally, I was on board with the podcast idea, but, after reflecting on what I personally like about Last Week, I found that I most enjoy the quick succession of entertaining cuts to random events or comments that happen throughout the day. A podcast would have its moments, but I feel that the entertainment value of the visual jokes and the (probably previously-thought-out) cuts to Tom & Co.'s random quips every now and then give Last Week a unique, funny feel, that I don't personally find in many other vlog series, wouldn't be there in a podcast. Personally, I think, as a replacement for Last Week, you should do a bi-weekly or monthly vlog series. I don't want to lose that feel I get from this series or the excitement I have when I see a new upload that just won't be present with a static, talky podcast.\n\nI commend you for making it to the end of this wall of text, and I hope others agree with me.

3799,"Notice how they are black"	
3800,"Forget the racist BLM !! What a shining example to society these black people are. Whilst everyone is huddled in schools and basements, scared of being killed by this hurricane, these brave black people are putting their lives on the line to save their local shops stock from the hurricane, so they can buy things with their hard earned money from their 50hr a week jobs, once the hurricane has passed. Noticed, even when the police turned up, they didn't even stop for the police to give them a standing ovation for their bravery, they carried on running in and out of shops saving tv's/trainers the LOT !!"

3808,"Its a fact that blacks commit about 50% of the crime yet they're only about 13% of the population."	
3809,"Wow \nYou could fry an egg off the heat in this comment section."	
3810,"idiots.they'll still be arrested afterwards!"

3825,"Is there anyone else that is just bored with race and racism altogether? whenever I see anything to do with race and racism I just sigh and move on. \n\n Derogatory words are B O R I N G. Black lives matter and other race movements are B O R I N G. White supremacy is B O R I N G. Unoriginal stereotypes and prejudices are B O R I N G. Blah blah blah.\nSeriously the racists need to smarten up and stop being so stupid, and then, the annoying ass sjws and protestors can fuck off as well! Then we can live in a slightly less shitty world, where perceptions and discussions of race arent shoved down every hole in our bodies."	
3826,"STOP, please stop with all the racism,these people were actually saving businesses,from the wrath of Irma,look at At the shoes they saved,they should have been on CNN heroes,I mean come on Would you have bought wet shoes from those Foot Lockers?These people risk there lives to save those businesses,while the Whites, Hispanics,and Asians were to scared to save those businesses,they were  hunkered down in there homes👍👍👍"	
3827,"There all black. Not being racist."	
3828,"Not all blacks commit crimes but for those that do, you let yourselves and your people down by being awful ambassadors. Understand that when Whites commit crimes, they don't get tarnished because they control and manipulate the media to their liking and bias. Your people don't have that luxury so you have to be better than whites. Look at the Asian and Indian Americans as example."

3836,"All Black people, Then they ask why... come on on black people defend you're self against video evidence and show how stupid you are buy saying things like... \n\n1. Maybe you're lacking intelligence but most black people live normal lives and this video only shows a few black people. Don't condemn the whole race for a few people.\n\n2.Plenty of white people been doing this too, but when they do it they're scavenging for supplies.\n\n Oh yeah sure.... bla bla bla... people are losing there life and you just want to get them adidas trainers.\nDon't matter what you say, it can't beat video evidence.\nShould be ashamed of them self's."

3843,"Look at all those evil white looters..."	
3844,"They're all black huh..."	
3845,"It is just sad what their values are.  I'd like to know what kind of house each one of these people live in.  I'd like to know what they drive.  I'd like to know how deep they are in debt.  I'd like to know if they have jobs, checking account or savings.  I'd like to know if they are on welfare and their level of education.  Their values are so different from the majority of the people in the US.  They are 200 years behind."	
3846,"Look at all those white ppl stealing..."	
3847,"Oh I'm so distraught and upset... I know what I can do to make myself feel better."

3855,"Oh look at that blacks stealing shit that ain't theirs..... now that's something you don't see everyday...."	
3856,"Now that's something I would not do... BUT if there was a nice looking 75 inch 4k TV just sitting nicely on display!! Cough cough.."

(most of these  comments are people saying racist shit and they have the audacity to not act like this off their keyboard) fuck outta here.

3888,"I'm genuinely surprised that some sick people would take advantage during an extremely devastating time."	
3889,"So White people as always trying to pin the blame on black people, or should I say white men trying to pin the blame it is so obvious that white men don't want to lose their wealth and power so they make the hurricane happen to make black people look bad."	
3890,"When the rich and powerful finally destroy the middle class there will be a lot of white people doing exactly the same!!!"	
3891,"Can everyone just stop for a minute and  just think about what you're about to write, because what you write now, may have an impact on somebody else's life. I agree these black people are disgusting for what they did and they should be locked up, but this doesn't mean all black are . People shouldn't be judged based on the actions of few ignorant people."	
3892,"truly shameful comments section."

I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though!"	
4101,"Oooh I like this one - the ELDWN not the LL!.  Is it my imagination or did the swatch of this look really similar to the swatch of the Dermacol 208?  Since that's my perfect shade, this cool bone one might be as well (at least in this formula anyway).  The same colour in the other formula being so different - I wonder if there was some sort of a mix-up and it was mislabeled since it looked so different (it actually looked way to yellow to be called cool anything)."

I thought it showed off her texture way too much and her skin looked uneven in color and it also made her pores show so much more with this foundation. I've seen plenty other foundations you tried look absolutely beautiful.on your skin but this one for me didn't do it for you ."

Forinstance,  for 'wicky wild wild', make a tree of all letters with frequency set to 0, encode 'w', rebuild tree for 'w' with frequency 1, encode 'i', rebuild tree for 'i' with frequency 1, and so on. Encoder and decoder read the letters in the same order, produce the same tree."	
4617,"Wow the writing... SO GOOD !!"	
4618,"Why does this amazing explanation has to be released after my semester exams?? 😥"	
4619,"How is a space compressed?"	
4620,"Sending the wrong Worms? So, you send Worms Crazy Golf instead of Worms World Party?"	
4621,"Doesn't the Huffman tree suffer the problem of having variable length encoding for characters? How do you know when one coded letter ends and the new one begins?"	
4622,"Tom, what sort of bet did you lose to have to work 'Wicky wicky wild wild west' into a video?"	
4623,"It is quite naïve to think that english is 8 bit characters..."	
4624,"lossy text compression using natural language processing is totally a viable thing, but it probably isn't easy"	
4625,"0:54 Worms ahahahah I see what you did there"	
4626,"Hi Tom, thanks for these! We spoke a while back about doing some videos like this for GCSE Computer Science students, this is perfect. Hope the trial goes well and you fancy doing some more :-)"	
4627,"haHA!!! Worms. I don't get it?"	
4628,"Love it when a youtube video makes me feell like I lerned something. Tbank you, Tom"	
4629,"sending the wrong WORMS  haha , I see what you dis there !"	
4630,"great video!  I have been wondering this for quite a while (but been too lasy to look it up ...)"	
4631,"I thought it was: take the most common words, assign a brand new character to each of them, and insert whenever that character comes up."	
4632,"@0:52 haha send the wrong worms? nice one!"	
4633,"Really amazing video quality. Something very different this time. I love your channel..."	
4634,"What is the work joke? I don't get it"	
4635,"Can you please do videos based on computer science 2210 whole theory syllabus? I really need help with my exams which are on October. I hope you see this message. Please like this so he can see. I never comment on YouTube videos. And I really want to get good results on this exam. My computer teacher sucks. I'm desperate.😭"	
4636,"The only thing better than being the best is mathematically proving you are the best."	
4637,"This one of only two things I remember from my programming module - the other is a habit of typing both the open and close brackets at the same time."

4640,"If you break in to house and steal cold cuts out of fridge are you then a hamburglar"

4644,"now do GZIP/7z/RAR... jpg/png/bmp... mp3/wav/ogg... i gots to know"

4647,"Or as it's known today	 Huffcod."
4648,"I feel like an expert"	
4649,"I hate it when I send the wrong worms"	
4650,"I love this series. If you decide to continue, I would be very much for it!"	
4651,"These series are great, Tom. You have a knack for explaining complicated concepts intuitively without losing what's important. Do you use any unconventional techniques for understanding the concepts deeply enough to capture the gist of them like this? My current strategy is reading and trying to incorporate the concept in my current knowledge base, but it usually takes 2-3 readings to do."	
4652,"I know about this stuff already but still watch it because Tom Scott is a good lad"	
4653,"This is magic. I've just finished my text compression algorithm in C++ the day before yesterday, and this video was uploaded. I feel I'm being observed."	
4654,"Hoffman ripped off Euclid but a search tree is a elemtry algorithm"	
4655,"Why can't I give you 5 likes for this video :-("	
4656,"THANK YOU TOM SCOTT!! I have wondered how compression like this worked for the better part of a decade, and I've even put a decent amount of time into researching it, but it never clicked until this video.  You have the best content on this entire platform, both in subject matter and quality."	
4657,"... send the wrong worms. Ha! I see what you did there!"	
4658,"And I can apply Huffman to save the Huffman tree, and the Huffman code, or again. So actually  we are just trading space for work, right? Or storing information into work? That's cool. Maybe it's what the universe is doing right now, unveiling its stored  Huffman code through chemical reactions."	
4659,"Yeah, cool stuff. I'll just keep using my golang gzip/(whatever your preference is) library since I'm trusting scientists to do this for me. Seriously, I'm too busy actually building things irl to re-invent the wheel just for fun."	
4660,"I wrote a full on huffman compressor for fun once. I was disappointed that it only yielded about, like you see here, 30% compression (leaving 70% the original size.) I figured I did something wrong."	
4661,"I read the thumbnail as “How Computers Computers Text”"	
4662,"As usual, darned fascinating! Please continue with the series. I know _some_ stuff but I'm learning lots!"	
4663,"Always wanted to say that I love your voice, Tom. This is actually the reason why I subbed."	
4664,"Can we please get into foreign characters?"	
4665,"You should keep doing this kind of videos, it was enjoyable and really informative - don't get me wrong I always learn something from your vids, but this was one of a kind-"	
4666,"I love this channel so much"

That is how I feel. As for Portia, I would have never guessed she was bisexual. \nRegardless, my assumption was he was on the LBGT+ spectrum. \nAlso, I think him wearing that suit, was a give away. He almost seemed uncomfortable in it. It was look big, and didn't seem to fit who he is.\n\nAND, and the way they parted ways-- they should have been instant BFFs.

5164,"LOVELY JUST LOVELY 💙I JUST REALLY ENJOYED 💯There conversation with each other."	
5165,"Okay so from a guys perspective - from the UK. Where we say everything exactly how it is and to the point. Not like our American cousins who sugar coat the truth in order not to offend...\n\nI feel as though this could of went down a whole other way, if the guy had given off more of a manly vibe about him. He didn't exactly come across like he either knew what he was supposed to be doing (i.e. naive in dating) or that he just came across as more feminine. Things such as little gestures like head shaking when saying beyoncé and that whole ohh hey gurl ...vibe. Probably instantly put her off. As for her... Well he wasn't exactly trying to find compatibility in terms of sexual connection so the whole thing seemed doomed from the early stages, for me.\n\nThat's just what you guys would call throwing my 2 cents worth in..."

5338,"Here's a story of me in college. Now see, I had a crippling fear of water. Not water *water*, but a body of water. The sea, a river, the *pool*. But I knew how to swim, ironically enough. So, my friends one day saw the Olympic sized pool in campus and were like HEY! LET'S DO A SWIMMING CLASS!!!\nNo. I said.\nCome on! It'll be fun!\nI know how to swim, no need.\nSam, please, you'll have fun. This will be on of those CV things you can add, right?\nLike the monstrosity that they were, they forced me to sign up. And that's when the horror started. Twice a week, they would drag me screaming to the water. Bless the coach, she was very understanding and was very slow in advancing me, she kept me behind on the others as she slowly tries to break away the fear from me (Which she did, again, bless the coach) and then, that's when they discovered that I really can fucking swim.\nDo you want to know how I can swim but fear the water? My dad threw me in the sea, far away from the beach, with only a floaty jacket thing on me. To teach me how to swim.\nTill this day, my coach still asks for me to join the swimming team, and while I am grateful for her, nope. Just nope."	
5339,"*cries* My parents are threatening to disown me if I don't do medicine, my sister, an optometrist, has a grudge against med students and is half-forcing me to do computer science and I'm not allowed to follow my passion of psychology because my hypocritical mother doesn't believe in mental health and also thinks that I'll become insane if I follow a psychology pathway.

5341,"Try to be social~Dan\nEASIER FUCKING SAID THEN DONE DAN~Me"	
5342,"Advice for a good university experience:\n- don't live alone, live in a shared flat or dorm (cause if you're like me and live alone you'll end up not leaving the house and not talking to anybody and being depressed because you don't have flatmates who ensure a minimum of social interaction so you don't forget how to speak)\n- try to live in the city center or not too far from it (you'll miss out on a lot and spend much time commuting if you don't)\n- talk to people. Everybody is like you, they are all clueless and trying to find new friends so they will be glad you approached them\nI've studied for 4 years now and that are the most important things imo."

5355,"Making friends at university as an adult is hard as fuck. I moved three states away to study and was still 17 when I started my degree. I couldn't go to the drink nights and etc because I was still under aged and lived about 2 hours away at the time. So I could only spend time making friends before and during my lectures. In saying that, I found plenty of social groups when I turned 18 and went to the many bars. It was incredibly daunting and anxiety inducing but I've made so many new friends (even thought they are all 6+ years older than me)."

My roommates and I hit it off really well really quickly. My first weekend up here, we decided to go out for a night at a club, when one of us disappeared for a moment. Being the Dad friend I am, I decided I'd go look for him, and as I rounded the corner of the outside of the club, I stumbled upon him peeing. Ya know that little shiver you get sometimes as you pee? Like, right at the end? Yeah, well that happened as he looked me dead in the eye. I don't talk to him very much now"

5365,"Wow. Your first week was insane. Mine was 8 hours a day marching band and bed. Then school actually started and I found out my first class (9 am history) was across campus in a giant building with 600 students. At least everyone on my floor made friends and i made friends in 2 of my classes and band. My year seemed to have been better than yours sorry Danny 😂😂😂 I'm started in my second year at least"

The NFL is just 32 billionaires making money on the backs of people willing to destroy their bodies. There are 30 players in the NBA with guaranteed contracts of more than $100m. There are zero in the NFL."

PERIOD.\n\nSo there are 12 QB's as a GM i would take over Kaep, easily. And my NFL team building strategy at the QB position changes drastically if my QB choice is under top 12-15. I move the time and dollar resources to full other needs on the team until my QB options improve. But to offer you a second chance you can just be a guy on the team."

And I live 20 minutes north of Turlock and I used to work there and I can tell you in equivocal that town is very Prejudice towards so-called minorities.

5539,"It was peaceful that's why"	
5540,"Something isn't right here Snoop Dogg clean cut and not high the world is going to hell"	
5541,"This is a stupid question of Kaepernick not being on a roster. Just say, Listen, we want to test you to see whether or not we conform you to our opinion on issues so you can keep your money. It doesn't matter, it's not an issue, and both Snoop and Magic should just say, I'm making money and making moves and I'll hire Kaep and he doesn't need to risk CTE or ridicule. It's a stupid set-up question and I can't give you guys all this money without making you think like me. Here's the money, say what I tell you to say. Yeah, we are going to pretend like this is a casual conversation... HAHAHAHA!!!"	
5542,"Most all Protest by BLM is not peaceful. So what is your point Snoop? Looting, Vandalism, murder, and so on should be overlooked for a righteous cause. Uh, No!"	
5543,"I personally don't agree with his kneel during the anthem but the fact that he exercised the 1st amendment is what I respect. That takes real courage and especially since he's a good quarterback, he should be on an NFL team. Plus I can name players off the top of my head that have done far worse things and violent things as opposed to a completely peaceful protest so that's inexcusable for the NFL."

5550,"First Take you just don't get it do you..I want to state that I do want Colin Kaepernick to play NFL football..But here the thing.. This stuff has happen before..Tim Tebow  takes a knee for God and Michael Sam tells everyone he is gay..The reason why I bring up these two up is because the media followed them everywhere they went...And the same goes to Kaepernick...Teams don't mess with the Tebow's  the Sam's and the Kaepernick's because of the media..Colin did had a chance to sign to the Ravens..Till his dumb girlfriend made a stupid tweet...Colin I hope you play football again,But you got to get the media off your ass.."	
5551,"Colin gets no love from me, I mean if this really is his beliefs then why didn't he do this in college or his first year in the NFL. Ill tell you why because this really isn't his beliefs its to push the lefts agenda that divides people further which is weird to me since there always talking about unity but continue to push a narrative that divides people. I just ask most Americans to wake the fuck up and recognize the fake people out there. Its not hard to see if you look close enough."	
5552,"Kap sucks lets face it. He may be better than 5 of the starting qbs in the NFL but he aint shit"	
5553,"Hey Magic Johnson, will you take a knee at Laker's games this year?  Hypocrite."	
5554,"Is magic implying that with Kaepernick teams have chance to win the super bowl? Wtf....  How does a backup qb gonna improve your team so much bettet for your team to win a super bowl"	
5555,"When did Colin talk about our school system? Gtfo"	
5556,"He is not getting jobs because he is a sh*t starter and he brings a lot of negative attention and energy to the team. YES...he can definately stand up for what he believes in but the hesitation is the sh*t starting. No one wants that on their team. Whether it is sports team, corporate team, restaurant team, etc."	
5557,"He's not on a team because he's not worth the distraction he'll bring. Blaine Gabbert was starting over this dude"	
5558,"Kaepernick was already benched, talk of him being cut, BEFORE he ever started kneeling. He's just not good enough, never was a team player, and not worth the trouble. It's not like he is a cut superstar. He's like 3-16 over the past 3 seasons!"

5581,"Lmao! I bet they wish they had CK now!!! Dumbass teams"	
5582,"LOL the retards in commenting are being so dishonest. None of these guys know shit about football.\nKaepernick is a backup, or a starter on a bottom 5 team at best. Once you look at all the negative publicity he brings with him it's no surprise whatsoever no team wants him. Miami would've signed him, but wait huge Cuban population who hate Kaepernick because of his Castro support ( pretty disgusting, I mean the guy was a genocidal dictator ). Also, the Ravens were set to sign him, and his gf sends out a racist as f tweet that ruined the deal, as Ray Lewis has been attesting to.\nThere are studies that have been done showing the NFL's loss in viewership was directly tied to these anthem protests, so if a player is already bad and does this shit, none of you can act shocked or disgusted when they get cut.\nThe owners have a vested interest in keeping viewership up. Capitalism only cares about making money, it doesn't care about your skin color or your sexuality morons"	
5583,"What these rich bozos don't understand is that the middle class OVERWHELMINGLY disagrees with Kaepernick's tactics. They see it as disrespect toward our military. So regardless of the truth in his protest, MOST, and yes, MOST, sports fans see it as disrespectful. Stop trying to twist it into a race thing because it ain't."	
5584,"We all know what's up by now right? Let those in this country continue to hide their racism and bigotry behind false beliefs, and let's continue to call them out and expose them for what they truly are. Make America great, this time!"	
5585,"White people only tolerate black people when they entertain.....nobody is asking for Kap to get back in a league that is full of white supremacist owners, coaches, and some players who are white."	
5586,"Colin kap is trash and cant lead a decent offense. Hes a distraction disrepcting our anthem and flag. Fuck that wanna be hood rat. Dude is whiter than micheal rappaport under that little tan of his."	
5587,"If Kaep kneeled for veterans not being taken care of he would of never had these problems everybody would of agreed and loved kaep... But doing something for black people will get you punished"	
5588,"What did he do so wrong?\nMe as an American with 100% Puerto Rican descent. I can say say he disrespected a whole nation by taking a political stance while representing an organization and his team. My sister and 2 cousins served in the military along with my grandfather may he rest in peace. fought against the real Nazi's.\n Unwritten in some job's and written in some job's are.. don't talk about, 1sex 2 religon 3 politics"

5647,"Hello Fleur!!!! Ugh!!! One of my favorite videos you do but yet it's also one of the dangerous ones. I literally have a bad habit of buying anything you recommend. for example I bought the new Jo Malone perfume you showed on your IG story the next you posted it but I'm justifying that purchase as a bday gift to myself. I was wondering if you have any suggestions of any YouTubers that have good make up suggestions/tutorials for olive skin. I love how you do your makeup. Its simple and it's more to enhance your look rather than change. But since my color tone is very olive I find that I can't pull off the same looks as you. Thanks for reading. It's always a highlight to my day"	
5648,"What eye shadows are you wearing in this video? It looks amazing. Could you do a tutorial on this look?"

5651,"Love the lipstick your wearing, What one is it please 😀"	
5652,"It's a shame that most of it is not cruelty free."	
5653,"Such a fun video!  I love to see all the new make up launches.  Thank you so much for taking the time to put all this together.  The make up you are wearing is really pretty on you.  I don't know if this has launched in England, but here in the USA Bobbi Brown has launched some new lipsticks called Crushed lip color.  These lipsticks are more of a moisturizing stain.  They are not metallic at all.  When I was growing up metallic lipsticks were called frosted and everyone wore light pink frosted lipsticks.  I think some light metallic lipsticks are pretty, but the lipsticks with actual glitter are not my cuppa tea.  Thank you again, Fleur for a wonderful video."	
5654,"That's so pretty good thanks hun"	
5655,"Try using the Bare Minerals foundation with a wet sponge, gives it a much better look/feel :) x"

5675,"When there are 4 new uploads in my notification and I went with Fleur first... no brainer! Love new in beauty!"	
5676,"I did give you a thumbs up but grudgingly.  I think you included too many products and spoke so fast tht I can't remember any of the products you mentioned that you liked and why.  I do appreciate that you are willing to be honest with the items you like and the items you don't.  I find it interesting that you are motivated by packaging as a product being a success.  I love beautiful success and I know that is where the beauty company spends their money, cuz the product is not where they are spending the big money.  For me, the product and what it is supposed to do is what matters most.  The last five years I noticed companies have stepped up the packaging game and have scammed us with fancy packaging and crap products because we are visually driven.  Smart for the seller and stupid for the buyer.  Thanx for your comments."	
5677,"Color ways I feel like the British sometimes don't really speak grammatically correct lol"

5683,"Your makeup is so pretty in this!  Can you list what you used if not a tutorial on this look?"	
5684,"I am literally only excited & interested in one product, Hourglass Confession lipstick. It's the only brand that's fully cruelty free. I am still so surprised at how many beauty influencers, especially ones with pets, still buy products from brands we all know still test on animals!!! It actually makes me so mad & sad, & it's such a huge shame that it appears lots of people don't give a damn about what happens to animals! Hope the pregnancy is all going well for you Fleur xxxx"	
5685,"I was just staring at your brows the whole time - they look perfekt! Shape, color everything 😁😍"	
5686,"I honestly don'tget why people would pay the amount of money they do for these expensive brand products, when you're actually just paying for the brand name and not for the actual quality of the product. I doubt you'll see any actual difference between a dior mascara and a maybelline one."	
5687,"seriously thinking of buying the new chanel perfume, already tried it and its beautiful"

5730,"This system of government is so insanely bad and vulnerable to abuse that it is a miracle that this state lasted so long...."	
5731,"We Spartans are the strongest!!!\n\nAnd then the Roman Legions arrived. xD"	
5732,"not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame."

5735,"to me [degeneracy] sounds like they were just having a good time\nAnd that is why the West is dying. History tells some hard truths that we refuse to aknowledge because we are too weak willed to  offend someone, or take initiative."

5737,"So that's why Sparta fell, feminism. It all makes sense now."	
5738,"I had no idea that Sparta's political system was so unusual. Thanks for a great video."

5744,"Well this video blown up"	
5745,"Wow, usually your videos are really great, but this one completely blew me away. I didn't know much about the spartans, just that they were very conservative. Wow. Keep up the excellent work!"

5751,"When the Romans conquered Sparta and its lands, were the Spartans forced to live by the Roman law/customs? Or did they keep up (part) of their own culture?\nGreat video btw, loads of information	 but packed clean and clear. Well done."
5752,"the spartans had slaves that allowed the entire population to live like aristocracy and devote their time to war. We have so much technology that much of what is needed to run a society is done my machines overseen by a few people. We could use this to shorten the average work week to something like ten hours but capitalism lives off growth and would never allow this. there will always be new jobs until we implement a universal basic income. we could be the new spartans. we could live like kings off the fruits of our technology. sure, some work still needs to be done but not as much as is currently being done. 60% of people in britain believe their job is actually unnecessary.\n\nwhen self driving cars take all the jobs from truck drivers and taxi drivers, capitalism will create new jobs for them or leave them unemployed and in poverty. what if instead we realised that we have less work to do as a society and the same amount of people. implement a UBI and allow people to work less. \n\nhumanity has pushed the frontiers of science and technology for thousands of years. its time to relax and live off the fruits of our labour.\n\nif you ask people what they would do with a universal basic income nearly everyone has an idea of something productive they would do. maybe theyd do charity work or start a business or study. if you ask people what other people would do with a UBI, nearly everyone responds the same theyd just spend it on cigarettes and alcohol. theyre wrong.\n\nCapitalism is not the future and communism is not the only alternative. the time is ripe for a UBI"	
5753,"Spartiates were forbidden to take foreigners into their numbers, fertility declined from inbreeding, thats a big part of why their numbers declined."

5759,"Ah bruh let me design some t shirts for you so you can make some dough"	
5760,"I thought Sparta was averse to going to war because they were worried their slaves would rise up, rather than the men engaging in debauchery."

5762,"Best history channel on YouTube.  Well done, man."	
5763,"The Spartan decline is due to the Thebans under Epaminondas freeing the helots of messania from their captive state. The Thebans decisively defeated the spartans at the battle of Leuctra, and marched on into their heartlands. While not being able to conquer Sparta itself, Epaminondas moved into Messenia and freed the helots there. This was a third of Sparta's land, and about half of the helot population. To make sure the Messenians would remain a free people he rebuild the city of Messene, and with it build some of the strongest fortifications in all of Greece.\n\nWhile Epaminondas died a few years later and Thebe as a major power with him, the Spartans never recovered from this defeat. It meant that the Spartans could no longer field there entire male population as an army, for the simple reason that there were not enough helots to feed and supply them. It was also a huge moral defeat, as both the Spartans as the rest of the Greeks no longer saw the Spartan army as invincible. It has to be remembered that the massive loss of land counts for much as well. For example the 'heiresses' could no longer uphold their wealth if a third of their land or more was suddenly no longer in their possesion. This meant that not only did the spartans lose their ability to field a massive army, they also lost the power to fund it.\n\nWhile this does not completely account for the MASSIVE loss in influence and manpower, it  was without a doubt the start of the decline. It was probably, as you said, that they were not willing to change their ways after losing half of their helot/worker population"	
5764,"ALL THE GREEKS JOINED ALEXANDER THE GREAT,ONLY THE SPARTANS STAYED BEHIND FOR FRAPE!!!\n\nHORIS LOGIA!!!"	
5765,"Wasn't there a class of non-citizen freemen who lived in the Spartan lands? If I remember correctly they mainly did the jobs that were seen as above the Helots but beneath the Spartans proper, such as a good deal of the merchant work, as well as serving in the army if called upon. In fact if my memory of my undergraduate reading doesn't fail me it was actually possible for these freemen to be elevated into full Spartanhood under very special conditions and with the support of a Spartan citizen."	
5766,"Please, make  battle of stirling bridge,but without William Wallace throwing fire through the eyes and thunder through the butt.\nI love your history videos."	
5767,"It's nice to see how popular this channel is. There is so much junk on You Tube it's nice to see some people still have class. Hail Caesar o.o/"	
5768,"22:20 \n\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\n\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \n\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \n\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\n\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\n\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \n\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure."	
5769,"Wow, they sound like they have a pretty Democratic system."	
5770,"Waiting forever for another one of his videos, good lord I love them :)"	
5771,"Sounds like the Gerousia were kinda detrimental to the whole thing."	
5772,"I've seen an in-depth historian's account on the Spartan mythos that debunks a lot of their image as the dominant Greek military power.  Long story short, tales of the Battle of Thermopylae became overblown propaganda, even corrupting the perceptions of Sparta pre-Persian invasion.  It wasn't until much later that Sparta got a strong, sophisticated military, perhaps just from trying to live up to their new reputation.  Self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.  Only really relevant to the opening of this vid.  As always, thanks for all this fascinating info!"	
5773,"And here comes Rome to fuck all y'all shit up"	
5774,"Probably their government got big and ate the honest citizenry."	
5775,"The artstyle and general visual digestion of this video is quite spartan."	
5776,"Is this video about the constitution of Sparta or Spammers? Cause your comments section is unusually infested."	
5777,"I believe not every ancient authors were uncritically admiring of Sparta. They suffered a pretty nasty defeat against Thebes at Leuctra, after all, and it was downhill from then on. It's a pretty important battle in ancient military strategy, I hope Historia Civilis covers it some day."	
5778,"It didn't help when the Spartans killed their babies to see if they were perfect or not."	
5779,"DAYUM! You shit on their entire system of government at the end!! Maybe all the hommies moved out cause they wanted to have a little fun?"	
5780,"Ah the Gerousia, my fallback for when someone who doesn't understand statistics talks about how life expectancy in ancient times."	
5781,"...My God, and I thought Rome's government was confusing. I've rewatched this many times, and I honestly followed Rome better than this shitfest. Holy hell man..."	
5782,"Are you going to do the wars with Persia?"	
5783,"You had no business dismissing Aristotle for criticizing extreme wealth and luxury. He was totally right - and pretty much all the other ancient philosophers have the same criticisms of the elites of their societies. Great video otherwise, but that one point was surprisingly stupid."	
5784,"Firstly, in the From Democrats to Kings, Michael Scott narrates a lot of battles throughout the V and IV B.C centuries and also how warfare evolved to something more killing efficient. I don't remember if it was him or someone who was debating on the specific topic of Sparta's declining military prowes, but it was a point that the continous loss of men able to fight and also the inability for the Spartans to change that was responsable for it's eventual decline. I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\n\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks? Ha! I will see myself out."	
5785,"Their was nothing glorious about Sparta they were a dictatorship fascism slave society, it was doomed to fail."	
5786,"When you say that a spartan male reached adulthood he received land from the state im pretty sure that only Spartan citizens received land. And to be a citizen you had to pass the Agoge (spartan military education) not simply come of age"

5791,"I love the Rome videos and don't want them to end, but I'm super-psyched that you're expanding your territory. Keep it up!"	
5792,"the roman rectangle at the end gave me goosebumps :D"	
5793,"One reason for their decline may be that citizenship was hereditary, and that one punishment for lawbreaking was loss of citizenship.  Whether a convicted man and his descendants became Helots, I don't know, but he & his were barred from military service. Over time, then, the pool of recruits simply dried up.  Or so I've read...."

Companies have a legal obligation to shut down these types of projects because if they don't, they stand to lose the right to their IP in subsequent projects.

5887,"Waluigi is the ultimate example of the individual shaped by the signifier. Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images	 lost in a hall of mirrors he is a reflection of a reflection of a reflection. You start with Mario – the wholesome all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi – the same thing but slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario – Mario turned septic and libertarian – then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a being who can only exist in reference to others. Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi’s identity only comes from what and who he isn’t – without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man. In a world where our identities are shaped by our warped relationships to brands and commerce we are all Waluigi."

I can only look back in anger as I feel we did nothing about this issue once again. Not having a go, it's just how I feel. I personally would not have been able to walk through that foyet. It's too much a case that the blood has been swept away let's carry on. Carrying on is why this continues. If people stayed away from public venues for a while then yes the terrorist win but not for long as our Govt would act once it hit their pocket.

Yeah lets forget the kids that were blown up and also the families that dont have a kid anymore. Mark my words the way corbyn,the Jews and the globalists are letting more muslims into europe there will be more attacks on our streets in the future.

All arguing about irrelevant shit whilst completely ignoring the fact this gig was held in memorial for innocent human beings, many of which were children, whom were killed in a brutal act of terror and violence. I was there Noel and you sounded amazing, the version you played was perfect for the occasion and the 15,000 voices singing in unison was a sight to behold.

6137,"holy shit. I think i have derealization. i always feel like i'm not actually 'there' like it was all a dream. i thought it wasn't a mental illness i always thought that it's just me being weird? but i didn't have any traumatic past though. i'm really scared."	
6138,"thank you. i really needed to hear this today, knowing that im not alone and that what i feel is valid <3"	
6139,"This video was VERY helpful for me to explain the differences between the 3 words. I have disassociation every single day, as other things happening in my body adds to this part of me going: ah, shit! Panic! Let's get out of this body quickly! It can show on me in many ways- feel like I'm floating being tied to a balloon so there's still this level of groundedness, or I have moments, especially when I'm not on my anxiety meds, where I just feel loony and I cannot connect what I am seeing to me, as if I am in a video game or I'm always strapped into a VR headset, it's terrifying and no one I've said about it so far really thinks this is real or it's not all in my head, so I just wanted to say thank you Dodie and her Therapist friend hehe ❤️❤️"	
6140,"When I get really depressed I don't recognise myself. Like I'll know I'm the one moving my body but it doesn't feel like me and when I look into a mirror I know it's my face because I know I'm looking into a mirror but I don't recognise it.\nThe longest that it has happened for one time was about a week\n\n*edit* When you were talking about small childhood issues that weren't that big but seemed worse at the time. At one stage the back of my hands were hit with a wooden spoon until my knuckels were bleeding, things like that still dont seem like a small issue"	
6141,"I finally know what to call this feeling	
6143,"I'm really reluctant to say that anything's wrong with me given that I'm so young, I've never had anything traumatic happen to me and I generally have a good memory, but I looked up a list of dissociation symptoms on a very reliable health website and I related to 8 out of 10 of them."	
6144,"Katiiii! I love this woman. Her videos saved my life, particularly her video on intrusive thoughts. I have severe OCD and I had a random spike in 2015 and I was very close to ending my life when I came across Kati's videos. If you're reading this Kati I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. 💕"	
6145,"i don't know why i'm crying halfway through but thank you for this. <3"	
6146,"So informative and helpful thanks lovely girls x"	
6147,"As someone who also suffers from derealisation and depersonalisation and is constantly told by therapists, I don't know what's wrong with you, or I don't know how to help you, this video was endlessly helpful for me. Thank you ❤️"	
6148,"When I got trama last year in my freshmen year and my way to cope was talking to myself which then turned into a imaginary friend. This friend then began becoming abusive (since they were my own thoughts) and kept me up at night. I haven't talked about it with anyone cause I'm 15 and I feel like they'll think I've gone mad..."	
6149,"I'm always so confused how you can like “test“ if you have depersonalisation or derealisation because how can I know that I feel spaced out? Like sometimes I feel like in a dream but then I'm like: “ah no it's real“ and that's it idk it's weird"	
6150,"This is super interesting and it actually helped me understand a few things about myself."	
6151,"I've had derealisation since I was really young but I never knew what was really happening. Lately I've just started to think it was something related to my anxiety. Thank you so much for making this video and explaining all of this it really helped."	
6152,"This was so interesting!"	
6153,"Even if I don't have derealisation or depersonalisation I have that kind of thoughts sometimes and I had anxiety and depression all this year and all your videos helped me so much. You talking about all this things makes me feel good because I found someone who knows what I went through all this months because even though there are a lot about mental illness in pages, there are not many people who actually suffers it and talks openly about it. Thank you so much Dodie. I know you're going to get out of this and that you're going to be able to feel yourself again."	
6154,"This comforted me I haven't recover since something that happened 2 years ago and to bring my brain back too! ❤️ \nI get headaches and anxiety too! And I fiddle so much and fidgeting since recovering from my trauma but I also might have ADHD too and still have derealisation too but I'm not diagonised but I know I have been going through depersonalisation for 2 years"	
6155,"Hi\nI don't really know why I'm doing this but I guess it's a way to say something and not have anyone knows it's me.Im so sorry if your reading this,this is prosbly gonna suck.So,I'm relatively young(still in high school) and I think (I thiinnkkk) I may need help.Like I need to get medication or go to a therapist and I know I know something is wrong I can feel it in my brain but my mum hasn't noticed anything so I guess in my head it means it can't be that bad.This is getting ridiculously long and I'm sorry but I just wanna scream what's the point of being here any more god damn it"	
6156,"This helped a lot for me to understand what I'm told I have when ever a panic attack it's going to happen which I guess is a good thing in away because I know when I need to take myself out of something so yeah thanks 😊"	
6157,"every time you talk about this, i feel a little less crazy because no one in my personal life understands it at all. it makes me feel like it's more real and like i'm not making it up. thank you! x"	
6158,"im not sure what im going through. its not good to self diagnose but i feel like i may have dissociation or derealization. i feel very spaced out and hopeless in certain situations regarding relationships and being interested in getting closer to someone (or sometimes just in general). i become very tired and want to cry, and i have no clue whats going on around me. my hands begin to doodle random things on my classwork and i dont understand what ive just learned when my lesson is over. i hear everything and do my work but i also dont have any clue of what im working on. i feel like sometimes i will doodle on my paper while not even looking at it and but i can see what im drawing. i very often draw eyes when i feel this way. they are always crying or rolling into the back of the head. im not sure what im feeling but if you could help me find out i would greatly appreciate it. - x mirae"	
6159,"dodie, i'm not exactly sure what i hope to gain out of writing you this message, as i'm sure you get tons of messages like this daily. i suppose its more so for me than for you, but i really want you to know what an impact you have had on me. i have been struggling with depersonalization/derealization since i was little, but recently after a car accident was launched into it basically 24/7 for a couple of months now. its truly the scariest thing i've ever had to deal with, and there have been so many times when i have felt so completely alone and ready to give up. just seeing that you also struggle with this and that you still manage to do so much and reach so many people, honestly that keeps me going sometimes. this disorder is truly one of the most devastating things in my opinion, but you are such a bright light. so thank you, for this and for being you ❤️"	
6160,"When I have panic attacks I can't feel anything, last time my friend was hugging me and I didn't know until she told me. It also feels like you've lost your sight? Because you're so out of it it's almost like you can't see in away and you're memory goes away, I don't know but that's what I have"	
6161,"I don't know if this is exactly what I struggle with, but it seems to be a close match. I do often feel as if everything is a dream and I can't process what real life means, I also struggle with brain fog, which for me feels like pressing up against a window (seeing) and not being able to look behind you, so everything you need you have to put your arms behind you and feel for (thinking) and the bit where you remove yourself from the situation is the worst. it's somewhere between turning yourself into data and having a video game glitch and you're underneath the character and the graphics are wonky. this is such a weird description, but anyways, I'm going to look into it."	
6162,"I've been dealing with dissociation and depersonalisation disorder for over a year now. I was scared to watch this video, because Dodie has always been my escape from everything. The world is so unfair for making her feel the same things and struggling with this condition the same way I and many people do. This video was very informative and super accurate, good job girls 👏🏻💕 I still felt hopeless after watching this, like I always do when it comes to dissociation. I just feel like there is no cure for this. Nothing ever works. I feel like I will never feel alive again and I will never get back the contact to myself that I once lost. I don't know who I am, I only know who I once was. But that person in the past is not me anymore. I just wish everything would end and I found myself again. It will be over, but I'll always be asking when?"	
6163,"how i finally understand the line in the twenty one pilots song holding on to you. left side brain, the part of your brain that depression festers."	
6164,"this was so helpful, thank you so much <33"	
6165,"Idek what's wrong with me if can't even form the words to make out what was wrong with me. It could be depression but I know for a fact I have anxiety I just don't know how severe. I went to go talk to a psychologist, but I don't know how to be verbal about my issues bc idk what's wrong. I am soooo confused with how I feel and my parents won't take me to a psychiatrist bc they don't want me on meds. Bc they think that they won't help bc my mom said she took them when she was a child and they made her feel disconnected from the world. But it affects everyone differently. But they don't understand. My mom says it's part of being a teenager and it's all in my head. And idk what to do. Omg I didn't think it was normal to feel this way when you're a teenager but my mom seems to have all the answers. And it drive me fucking mad. Bc I can't talk to anyone bc I can't explain what I feel. And jeez. Does anyone have any advice. I'm probably just rambling. My mind feels like mush like its in a haze of some sort. Idk pls help me someone. 😩😳😢"	
6166,"Dodie, thank you so much for making this video!! I could relate to a few things and you really helped me out. I also had EMDR and it really helped me! :)"	
6167,"I don't have depersonalisation but every now and then I can have a Trippy/ strange situation where I look at my hands and they don't feel like me. I say my name over and over in my head and I think 'who is that ' like how is my identity a name ? Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this ?"	
6168,"I don't have derealisation but I have anxiety and I sometimes get spaced out randomly. For example, I will be sitting in class and I will zone out just randomly and the same question pops in my head, what if reality is a dream? I feel like I'm dreaming! \n\nIt's very odd. If you have this please could you give me some wise advice because I am very confused lol thanks! Also Dodie I hope you get better soon with your therapy help! I'm not going to give you my pity because I think that that's the worst thing someone can do when your going through something. You kind of just want them to go away😂 Thank you for sharing this video with us! It sure helped me and hopefully a lot of other people! I love you Dodie! x"	
6169,"Dodie!!! Thank you and Kati so so much for this!!! I have derealization mostly in chunks of time and usually it's when I'm stressed, and this explained so much :) Thanks so much for explaining about the trauma--I didn't know about that! I think too many things were happening so my brain just spaced out. For some reason, before this, I assumed it was brain chemistry but trauma makes sense! I really hope you get better soon :) and I hope I can work through this too <3"	
6170,"so should i fake feelings when im  disconnected?"	
6171,"Hi! I have a question/need advice:\nI took a math test yesterday and as I started getting more stressed because of time, I could feel myself getting more and more sucked away. After I came to terms with the fact that I wasn't gonna finish it, I decided to do the easy ones on the back, but I couldn't even remember how to do a simple factoring problem. My mind wasn't there at all. I was wondering how to fix this/bring my mind back when this happens? When it does come back after I get out of that situation, panic attacks come on because everything rushes at me at once. Any ways to bring my mind back to focus WHILE it happens, then not get flooded afterwards?"	
6172,"I experience derealization because of a major traumatic experience and sometimes it gets so bad where I become basically unresponsive because I'm just so spaced out and it leads to people getting angry at me because I don't respond to them and when I'm so spaced out it can be scary when someone is yelling at me while I feel like nothing is real."	
6173,"OHHH MY GOD I LOVE THISSO MUCH I LOVE KATY SO MUCH AND I LOVE DODIE SO EFFING MUCH ARGHA"	
6174,"Wow! I didn't know that was a thing! I don't deal with it anymore but for a while when I spoke I didn't recognize my own voice it was very alarming and very uncomfortable. Glad to know there is a term for that if it ever sparks up again"	
6175,"Ok idk if this is anything but whenever I'm in a happy experience I feel like I'm not taking it in idkis that normal"	
6176,"i'm soo happy you made this video because i could never properly explain what it was to my family and friends!! i've had it for over a year now, but overtime it's become less of a problem because i learned to cope with it although at times it does get bad.."	
6177,"guys if u ever need to talk my sc is: sunkophunkie. tell me if ur adding me. i have been through a lot and still am"	
6178,"Are there more people that tried emdr but couldnt think back to the memories, because they were to much or something like that?\nI had that and i feel like it wouldve helped so much if i just dared to think back"	
6179,"I have issues with derealisation and depersonalisation every single day and this video was so damn nice and well put together. I think I'm going to show it to my boyfriend so he can understand more about what I'm dealing with and how just telling me to stop isn't gonna make me feel okay and that I'm not just being sad or whatever and me acting like I don't care anymore isn't because of him, it's just because I feel like nothing is real and I feel disconnected from myself. Hopefully this will help him understand more, if any of you have any advice please let me know 👌💕"	
6180,"I love Kati so much! thank you for this video!"	
6181,"Look at me I have problems -this girl tries to hard to look like she has issues"	
6182,"Okay so this is no way me trying to get sympathy, because I am doing very well mentally. This is mainly out of curiosity. So, summer 2016 I was really really I'll, basically I was in and out of hospital for a month, I had three surgeries and basically lost a lot of weight. Anyway, I went back to school four days after getting out of hospital (only for like an hour a day) and it definitely tired me out a lot. Basically what I'm trying to say is that during my recovery time I'd feel a lot of things described in the video. It wasn't constant (like it is for Dodie) but a lot of the time I'd feel like I was almost in a dream, and nothing really felt real. I wasn't too worried as it didn't happen for long periods at a time and it didn't happen lots. Also my memory of when I was ill is quite foggy and I can't pinpoint specific moments. So, I was wondering if you can get derealisation that only lasts for a short time. Because once I got better it stopped happening. I'm fine now so don't worry, I'm just curious if that's what it was as I'm trying to learn more about mental health illnesses so I can be more helpful to friends who might go through these thing."	
6183,"i don't know what type of dissociation i suffer from but i believe it's some type of mix between derealisation and depersonalisation. when i experience it (which is quite often) it feels like a different world in my head. it's basically like i'm writing a book/a whole different universe every time i experience it. it is a continuous story but when i get tired of it or when somehow i start writing a new world the older one doesn't feel right anymore and it stresses me out to force myself to continue with the older one. everybody in my universe (i believe that they're called paracosmos in the literature world) has their own set story and life and thoughts and i can project myself onto any of them and live as them and that's how i deal with my real life issues - i make up some storyline that somehow makes my character feel in a similar way to the way i'm feeling irl and deal with it by not being myself per say. some characters are reoccurring since i was 14 (i have experienced this since i was 12 but i recall moments when i was 7/8 of very similar situations) and others die with the paracosmos i leave behind (i still remember them and their lives and all of that jazz, and sometimes i bring them back) (characters can stay alive but i change parts of their storyline and you know i make sure they fit into whatever world i picture). it is mostly triggered and stimulated by audio and visuals and when i watch a movie or a tv show and a character from those really speak to certain parts of me i almost always make sure to include parts of them in my paracosmos (i don't know if i'm expressing myself correctly). i also feel very attached and connected to them. i do lose keep track of time and sometimes space when i experience this and i do have gaps in memory because of this. i also have a really weird sense of time like it still feels like 2012 in my head (i was 12 at the time). i also experience this involuntarily when i'm in a not so positive mood and have lots of stress and anxiety or when i'm sad and all that jazz. when i'm happy it cools down a bit and i can sort of choose when to write it? like i know that if i listen to music when i'm happy i will dissociate and i know that if i'm walking by myself i will also do it etc. aside from this when i'm living in the real world i do experience feeling like i'm out of my body and i'm not inside of it (specially in social situations and when i have to interact with people) it feels like i'm in a movie you know? there's a lot more stuff that goes around this thing but i feel like i've written too much so i'm going to keep it to myself. also sorry if there are any mistakes i'm not a native english speaker x"	
6184,"Hey, I wanted to share my story if anyone is listening so uhm yeah if you want to read it you can, I just wanted to since I've never talked about it before\n\n\nSo since I was born my mother has had depression, anxiety and severe OCD. Not the clean kind of OCD, the hoarding. So for 12 years I live in copious amounts of trash and filth, and of course I was never allowed friends over. I was constantly verbally abused by her but I never really understood what that meant at the time. It got so bad I had to share a bedroom with my dad, brother and me. Thankfully my dad and brother moved out to a house next door that we previously rented. It's still too ugly and mouldy to ever invite friends (I've never had a birthday party) but I'm so so thankful that I actually get to move around my house and freely enter any room without being bombarded with trash... Sorry if this is tmi I've just never told this to anyone, not even my counsellor. I'm 13 years old now and it still really affects my day to day life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I have self harmed and had one suicide attempt. I constantly feel pessimistic about my future. I get good grades, but I'm extremely anti social. I'm scared I'm going to develop Asperges, a genetic mental disorder my mum carries. My uncle has it and because of it I've never met him, same with my grandma. Sorry if this is a little weird, but it feels good to let it out."	
6185,"It's strange because I've just had a day of feeling spaced out but I feel so much more connected to myself now I'm watching this video, maybe because I relate? Or because it's helping me feel less alone x"	
6186,"I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING"	
6187,"I love this. I love Kati, she was so understanding i loved everything about this. so calming. thank you"	
6188,"Thank you so much for this video! It was really helpful to me and interesting to me, thank you thank you ❤❤"	
6189,"Great video, this is super interesting! I experience a few of these on and off occasionally and im ok with dealing with them a lot but when I'm worse especially when I'm panicked in a situation I can't get out of I get more physical things like painful pins and needles around my face and neck and the feeling like my skin crawling, what feels like really violent shivers down my spine,  is this a form of depersonalisation or just a physical manifestation of panic? I've always just called it depersonalisation because it seems like it would be but idk, I've always been curious.\n\nI'd like to try more types therapy though, I want to go back to talk therapy as it helped me a lot, especially with bigger things?  but I don't know if other things are worth trying more for the long term. Not excepting all the answers from youtube comments but still 😂❤"	
6190,"I'm not gonna say I have this stuff, but I tend to have episodes where everything feels like a dream and very distant. For a while I would have small moments of depersonalization, and during school years, I would have up to almost a month at a time or at least most of a week I will/would just have empty busy times. In those times I just go through life without thinking and barely remember what happens when I come out of it. I get really touchy a lot and I have a friend who used to physically latch onto people and when she did that to me, I got stressed and had that distant feeling and that feeling usually meant in a few days I would have those empty periods of time.\nI don't know, though. Just don't attack me, because I'm only saying I have similar experiences and am very paranoid and idk why, but I'm not going to diagnose myself."	
6191,"Can you have the text stay up for a bit longer on your videos please? I've noticed a few youtubers recently started making text come and go quite quickly and it's not always possible to pause the video fast enough to read the text . Especially important for something that is giving context and Wil make it more accessible to people. Thanks!"	
6192,"Okay this really helped me sort of understand why I feel detached from the world at times. I've been in a car crash and ever since it's scarred me & stuck with me for the past 8 years. My friends think I'm being dramatic but even I know I'm not being dramatic because I know it was sourced from somewhere. Thank you, Dodie ❤️"	
6193,"When I watched your last video I didn't really see myself with the things you were talking about, but this one where she was talking about the many little T's adding up it really hit me. also how you were talking about how touch can ground you, I've never really thought that was at all related to me not feeling alive or awake or real, but i guess it is now. I'm defiantly not self diagnosing but I think I relate with a lot of this.   \nI was wondering if it's possible to have more of a less severe case of derealization"	
6194,"omg doddie trendin"	
6195,":')"	
6196,"yeahhh sertraline sucked for me too rip"	
6197,"Shiny!"	
6198,"Thanks for this fantastic video! During my worst stages of anxiety I experienced depersonalisation and derealisation for 3 months straight. Luckily through coping techniques and talking through my trauma I overcame it and haven't felt this way in years. You got this Dodie! ❤"	
6199,"Hi Dodie! \n\nLet me first say that I love your music and your videos! They make my day better :)\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that I'm a 20 year old Music Education student and I was wondering if music therapy could be an option that you've considered for derealization/depersonalization. I'm not a doctor, but I do strongly believe in the results that music therapy can bring. I'd like to maybe know your thoughts about it too :) Does Britain have any programs like this (I'm from Canada and I do know it's becoming more popular here)? Could this be another helpful thing for people with this disorder?\n\nI don't want to seem bossy or anything	 I'm just curious about what you think and I'd like to help in any way that I can haha. \n\nKeep making videos Dodie and keep being an inspiration because you are doing amazing things :) Thanks :)"
6200,"thank you dodie for uploading this video. I understand more about derealisation and know there are other mental diseases out in the world noticed. Maybe I do have something or maybe I don't. Overall, you made my eyes open and make me feel real for just at least some minutes."	
6201,"I feel like I have dissociation, but it's not during moments of stress or trauma. It's mainly brought on by being awake in the middle of the night. Could being awake really late cause a trigger in my brain?"	
6202,"Thank god ive found the name for this. I'm already feeling a lot better."	
6203,"I posted a comment on here before, but the question just occurred to me. Has anyone down here in the comments gone through dp/dr and came out of it?  Best of luck to you Dodie. I'm actually in the UK now and it'd be amazing to meet someone else that's experiencing the same thing. Best of luck to you<33"	
6204,"I usually don't comment on this type of stuff, I doubt anyone will even read this but I don't know what's wrong with me. Everything feels like a dream. It doesnt feel real. I don't really have past traumatic events. I don't know why nothing feels real or why I get sad and tired all the time. I make myself busy doing stuff to try to distract myself and it doesn't work a whole lot. For some reason I feel not as sad currently and it changes from extremely sad to almost okay. When I'm upset I can't imagine what it was like to be happy. I write stuff when I'm sad and when I'm happy I'll read it and be like how did I ever feel this the main thing that messes me up is time. Stuff is over too fast and time just feels very weird"	
6205,"wow I've had derealization and depersonalization and I didn't know what was wrong but this helped me out so so much. I just didn't feel like I was there and I didn't feel like I was my self. I have more memories with my derealization because it used to happen A LOT. I never knew what was wrong. During those episodes I don't like talking to anyone because it makes me feel more out of myself. Thank you soooo much"	
6206,"This video made me realize that I have had moments of derealization and depersonalization in the past. Last year, when I was at school, I just felt like I was floating through a dream that never ended. Youtube has helped me feel those emotions again and all of the sudden the feelings would go away! Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel! Thank you so much for making this video, it helped me a lot! \nLots of love!"	
6207,"my? two? favorite? people? in? one? video???? I'm shook , I lo ve y a l l 💕"	
6208,"i'm not sure i have dissociation/depersonalization/derealisation? idk, i have long periods where my brain feels disconnected from my body... kinda like,, floating in the space above my head? weird concept i know,, and i don't feel like i have any emotion and every feeling- physical or emotion- is like dulled at the edges and sometimes lights can seem too bright and everything i hear seems like white noise. i don't really have trauma tho so idkkkk i feel like i'm being dramatic and unnecessary"	
6209,"The bit about the marbles was SO INTERESTING AND EYE-OPENING I never thought of trauma that way. I treated it as a single marble I wouldn't stop picking up instead of something that's been shattered/dispersed through everything."	
6210,"tbh the inside out analogy made a lot of sense"	
6211,"okay i need help. sometimes i get a feeling that sort of sounds like this but i dont know if it is or not. for example the other night i was in the backseat of my friends' car on the way home from a movie and idk why but she started tickling me as a joke and we were laughing and i was squirming and as i bent over to hide my face from her, i just felt this really weird wave of disconnection. like i was floating outside of my body, and i couldnt feel myself smiling or smell anything and all the sounds around me went hazy, like i was under water. it happened again twice that night when i was just sitting there in the car, not even laughing and moving around anymore. its happened more times for sure but that was the most recent. is this something to look into?"	
6212,"I zone out when I'm stressed and start to be quiet and sometimes I do it in class and it scares my teacher 😂 	-
6213,"that was so educating and well illustrated, i love it!!"	
6214,"I think I might have derealization, but like you when it's at its worst depersonalization. Honestly to me it's really terrifying. I don't fell like I'm here and that I'm in a dream. I really wish I could talk to a parent but they'd think I'm just going through a phase or being over dramatic. I really wish I could figure out what's wrong with me... \nBut I just wanted to say thank you so much dodie. Thanks to you, I figured some things out and why I'm feeling like this.

6218,"To me, looking in a mirror is a scarrest part of depersonalisation because you start to realize so well that something is wrong. Luckily I haven't experienced this for a long time like now it happens only when I'm extra tired and sad, it feels like your body tries to protect you"	
6219,"I cannot tell you enough how much this type of videos helped me! Really, really from the bottom of my heart thank you."

6224,"Can someone help me figure out whats wrong with me?? I have a constant state of feeling like I'm forgetting to do something (when I'm not), or that I should be doing something else. I'm often not content with anything I'm doing or feel uncomfortable with things i accomplish. Sometimes I feel better about it and other times it spikes, often after I go out to have fun or a major important event happens in my life. Can someone associate this with anything?"

6383,"Your flat is my ultimate homeware inspo! The first thing that drew me to your channel years ago was your love of bright colour (I am also an avid lover of turquoise) and in a sea of bloggers going for monochromatic everything with a 60% black you are such a breath of fresh air! My boyfriend and I are also moving this week and I'm pretty sure he's gonna love that steampunk lamp!"

6416,"You did a very good job!! I loved it all!!"	
6417,"Hi Victoria! I'd love to see you do a video on your coffee table book collection. I couldn't help but notice them behind you!

6421,"Love all of these pieces😍\nAlso what foundation do you have on? You're skin looks amazing!"	
6422,"Your new flat is lovely! Do you think you'll stay in London long term? X"	
6423,"Super cute stuff ! I moved in March and all I got so far are canvases for the walls and some plants .  Hahaha ! I'm not lazy, I just don't have the eye or the skill for decorating.  Wish i did !"	
6424,"You can buy fake versions of those flowers from Home sense if you have it near you"	
6425,"Loved this haul! So relaxed and enjoyable to watch ✨ aha yes and I also bought that mirror after seeing suzie get it, such a beautiful style and the size works perfectly for our big lounge 😍"	
6426,"First video and I love you, just subscribed ❤️"	
6427,"BEFORE I GET A MILLION COMMENTS ABOUT IT, YES I KNOW THE FOUNDATION DOESN'T MATCH! It looked really great in the beginning but obviously oxidized to be WAYYYY to dark by the end of the video. In front of all of my studio lights I couldn't tell but it's very obvious on camera. I love the foundation but will definitely be picking up a lighter shade!"	
6428,"you guys do realize that he's wearing an orange sweatshirt which reflects orange onto his face which makes it look more orange than it really is. fucking idiots. 😂"	
6429,"I tested trophy wife in store and like he said its really glittery and not as glowing and I think its really nice but I LOVE a glow, glitter isn't my fav"	
6430,"you said it yourself later in the video- the sponge absorbs most of the product. that's why it took so much foundation- not because of the foundation but because of the sponge. it's also a light to medium coverage foundation, not supposed to be full coverage."	
6431,"Who the hell is uses 20 pumps of foundation...I can't deal with any more than two pumps"	
6432,"I love when he says hi sisters 😚"	
6433,"If Jeffree Star doesn't think Trophy Wife is too dark than neither should you. You just applied way too much, didn't look bad at first."	
6434,"can everyone fuck off about how fast he talks ? like dern slow the speed down or sum."	
6435,"Can I recommend to maybe wear neutral toned clothing (next time) so it doesn't reflect onto your face from the bright lights?  I feel that that's mostly causing the orange face problem."	
6436,"yall needa stop being so rude jesus fucking christ. he got the wrong shade. chill. go fucking donate or do some good shit in the world than be a bitch online"	
6437,"I don't find anything wrong with your review don't understand why people got upset. Thanks for the review"	
6438,"Hey hey! \nI liked your review and you were honest about your opinion. Not everyone will like everything and that's okay. The foundation is great but it not only matches skin tone but the undertone as well and the one you picked up is a bit warm and you might be on the cooler/pink side. I don't like Sephora's lighting and they have done me in from time to time as well."	
6439,"I feel bad for him :/ if u don't like him then just leave it's not that hard"	
6440,"EVERYONE HAS SAID IT OXIDIZES.... JUST BC THE BRAND TOLD YOU IT DON'T DOESN'T MAKE IT THE ACTUAL TRUTH!!!! IT OXIDIZES A SHADE DARKER!!!! SO BE CAREFUL"	
6441,"So, you're doing a review with no knowledge about the products??"	
6442,"I think he applied alot of contour that's why he looks orange."	
6443,"Thank you so much for showing the darkest foundation color on your black friend. My nieces are half Jamaican and I've been having a hard time finding makeup lines that carry their shade. You're the only YouTuber that I've seen so far do this. It's great bc you've helped me and my nieces	 so I'd like to say thank you."
6444,"Was so surprised to see Tati!!! ❤️💖"	
6445,"Your sister thing takes me back to my childhood Mormon days 😂"	
6446,"No hate, but you obviously didn't buy it! You got it sent to you. Just saying!"	
6447,"WERENT YOU GOING TO QUIT YOUTUBE? YOU SHOULD HAD STUCK TO THAT PLAN DONE US ALL A FAV. YOUR DONE!!!!"	
6448,"Keep doing you babe, I thought this was a super fair review and it's honestly pathetic that people want to find any reason to hate on you 🙄 Much love x"	
6449,"Damn James you talked sooo fucking fast in this video 😂"	
6450,"i love you sister!"	
6451,"You speak faster than my ex c*ming"	
6452,"To me, you still did a good job. 🙌❤"	
6453,"Can't wait to try the foundation and primer out now! Although I think I'll have to take a bit of time picking out the right colour of foundation or one closest to my skin tone!! Love you videos!! ❤️❤️"	
6454,"Hate him, he talks to god damned fast.."	
6455,"his flashback test picture looks like a animated character 😭 why must you be so perfect😭😍"	
6456,"People don't have to love the brand just because it's Rihanna's if it's shitty it's shitty no matter who created t"	
6457,"You talk so fast😂"	
6458,"<3 So much love sister! Thank you!"	
6459,"It's not vine , it's youtube\n\nTake your time and stop (talking fast )"	
6460,"The foundation applied that way because u didn't use the brush that was made to apply it. And translucent powder is white like every other. U put so much foundation on....of course the other stuff isn't gonna blend correctly. I kinda feel like u are being bIas cuz u seemed a lol shooketh that u weren't invited to the event. But other than that...u talk quite fast"	
6461,"I'm getting annoyed that people think just because Fenty foundation is water base and also per Riri doesn't oxidized	 assume it's not going to oxidized . Foundation does get darker. Doesn't matter what situation .  What plays in is the person's skin type, how their bodies natural PH levels on the skin reacts to the formula , how much humidity is in the air, what products they put on before hand can cause a small chemical reaction to the foundation. Just because one is selling out doesn't mean it will work for you and your body chemistry.  There's a basic science to it . I hate how almost everyone in the makeup community thinks they are gurus 
6462,"Hey James I just want to say I thought your review was really good."	
6463,"you need to start breath"	
6464,"What is it that your closing yor eyes that much ?"	
6465,"Thanks for the honesty James! I don't want someone recommending something to be because they like Rihanna. I want to know what fucking works and what doesn't !"	
6466,"the most iconic sister"	
6467,"Wow I've watched so many reviews and my number 1 take away from the collection is that oxidization is HUGE I will be going 1 shade lighter."	
6468,"Why do you talk with your eyes closed and sound like you have a mouth full of jizz 🙄The hand motions and erratic head movements are so distracting. Also why are your nails done! I'm all for guys doing makeup but I just think it's creepy when I see dudes that have a dick and two balls wearing acrylic nails. Oh and stay off the Adderall pills please!"	
6469,"Am I the only one who prefers the Fenty beauty blender? It gives a more natural look he looked just fine with it. Using a lot of make-up only makes you look like a chalk board."	
6470,"get those damn lenses out of your head ffs ,cant even blink properly,gives me anxiety"

6802,"Maybe this was more like scalloped-edged lipliner? like nnnnn wouldn't wavy be more like ununun? Like, I feel like some of your lip should have been negative space. I MEAN it's a super fun bunny attempt and I loved this video obvs, but it just took me forever to figure out why it looked different than other peoples'. xD"	
6803,"I love how soft spoken he is."	
6804,"Okay, I just got a Spanish version of a L'Oréal commercial 😂😂😂"

6814,"I wanna nut in bunny"	
6815,"There are braided brows now as well... The make-up world has to stop 😂"	
6816,"no"	
6817,"A trend on trending 😂😂"	
6818,"I love getting to see Dogman! We need to see him more often! 😊"	
6819,"I gave an alligator it's wings one time.  Now it's, like, a pterodactyl.   :)"

6825,"You should try the orthodontist challenge"	
6826,"Why does she look and sound like she's on crack."	
6827,"He's a clown"	
6828,"All I know is that Pennywise is such an awesome band."	
6829,"I gave Jenny a thumbs up for the massive list of credits at the end, amazing :)  Your humor is top notch"	
6830,"I love you Jenny"	
6831,"penny wise & pound foolish. no one needs to know this tripe. learn to read a real book like The Way of All Flesh."	
6832,"Funny how? Like I'm a clown, I amuse you? They shoulda gotten Joe Pesci to play Pennywise. They coulda had him beat some kid to death with a shinebox."	
6833,"I wish she could make a movie, so I can try really, really hard to make a sarcastic video about it......"	
6834,"Ok, this is my favorite Jenny video by a wide margin. Her, I guess you'd call it trademark almost bored tone made describing a killer clown the funniest thing I'm likely to watch today. It's 7am and I've already hit my funny peak."	
6835,"From this movie, I learned that Pennywise was an actual clown that died in a previous Derry incident. \nIT probably just finds this form more universally fear inducing than the other forms he uses. \nI expect when he lets people get away it's because he wants to let the fear simmer for a bit. \nAlso the key to defeating him is friendship, like most of life's problems. \nhttps://pics.me.me/doubt-2-youre-right-i-cant-do-it-you-cant-20047874.png\nStephen King's IT: Friendship is Magic."	
6836,"Is clown college still a thing? \n\nCLM"	
6837,"It was more of a comedy then a horror movie honestly"	
6838,"When the patreon credits came up.... WHOA!  O_O"	
6839,"IT and a Turtle are Mortal Enemies."	
6840,"This video was ripe for clown-nose wearing potential.  Wasted."	
6841,"what the hell was that the vietnam wall memorial for the ending ?\nwtf was that x)"	
6842,"What are you afraid of Jenny?"	
6843,"I heard this theory that he’s a clown because “pennywise” the identity, is of a serial killer like John Wayne gasey in that universe. Because all of the forms he takes are of preexisting entities, like Beverly’s Dad or the lumberjack statue or the flute painting or Georgie"	
6844,"For once, I completely agree with this lady. Pennywise was not scary, and IT was very disappointing."	
6845,"Where is the giant porg!?"	
6846,"The sausagefest that is your patreon account is always the best piece of comedy in your videos"	
6847,"What if he went across monkey bars whilst upside down... like all gravity defying like?"	
6848,"So, like a crocodile, Pennywise is an ambush predator. 	)"
6849,"You're very pretty in glasses"	
6850,"You're so pretty."	
6851,"Just admit to us that you like being a clown haha, I can imagine him sitting there with a sad clown face when they say that to him."	
6852,"my god what happened to your porg! it shrunk!"	
6853,"My goodness you are attractive"	
6854,"as glad as i was when you went over to screen junkies just in hopes you'd make some money off your work, these are by far you best videos.  millennial falcon is great but i'm interested in hearing what you have to say on more than the one topic."	
6855,"3:13 He can dance if he wants to.  He can leave his friends behind.  Because his friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine.\n\n*safety dances out of the comment section*"	
6856,"I am so glad you did a video about the film! I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie."	
6857,"You know nothing of It beep beep Richie is what they say to Richie to shut up. He feeds on fear. And he likes scared children he says they taste better scared. He wants to scare them to eat them but he made a mistake of letting them live longer he thaught he could eat scare them more so that they would taste better"	
6858,"I never cared for Pennywise the band"	
6859,"i see you washed that porg and it shrunk down to a managable size."	
6860,"With the final confrontation with Pennywise they should have played a song from Queen."	
6861,"I've always felt that the deadites from the Evil Dead franchise feed off of fear as well, that to them it's a kind of art. Sometimes killing people is necessary for creating that fear, but if you watch enough Evil Dead stuff you start to realize that they take relatively few opportunities to actually kill.\n\nOff-topic, but whatever. I'm drunk."	
6862,"Mostly true lol, but for the first one he wasn't trying to catch him, he was trying to scare him because to him the more afraid they are the better they taste. That's also why he takes his time since hes trying to build up how scared they are. Funny video though"	
6863,"You're braver than I. I was not going to watch a killer clown movie."	
6864,"Hey. Jenny. You. Are. Beautiful. And. Clever. :)"	
6865,"4:10 o my goodness i didnt even think in that scene that way, now thats the only way ill think of it now. I HATE U FOR THIS"	
6866,"The clown, not the punk rock band"	
6867,"A big spider huh....thats an interesting notion 	]"
6868,"Why is that porg so tiny?!"	
6869,"Nah, penny wise says beep beep to Richie as a reference to the book. The kids used beep beep as an indicator for Richie to stop running his mouth yeah?"	
6870,"I know nothing about any sci-fi but i find her delivery so funny that she is one of 5 youtube subscriptions i have."	
6871,"I'm sorry—that was a great video—but the camera wasn't set right."	
6872,"Jennys hair looks like she got shes all that-ed right before she started shooting where she took off her glasses and shook down her hair in slowmo....but then couldnt see so she had to put the glasses back on"	
6873,"i always figured that the more fear a kid experiences the more the fear flavor builds inside them. Like how adrenaline makes animals taste gamey."	
6874,"I was just picturing Pennywise telling the Crimson King he was going to take the form of a Clown."	
6875,"Do more stars wars erotica fan fiction."	
6876,"Ok well now I feel like a total idiot for liking the movie. Thanks Jenny."	
6877,"I was with It, more or less, right up to the point where the kids locate the house and decide to wander in and tackle the supernatural killer monster with, uh... friendship? Stern disapproval? I guess they thought they'd prove it was real by having it tear them all to shreds. I found it tough to y'know, BUY IN after that point. Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even!"	
6878,"it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular. At the end of the comedian's jokes, they would beep a horn, similar to the 'drumroll' that we associate with the end of jokes on modern stand up comedy routines. So the beep beep richie part was basically saying, Ok richie, joke's over!"	
6879,"I love your analyses, but damnit don't ruin IT for me with your logic lol"	
6880,"In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster."	
6881,"There really was no rhyme or reason to his tactics. The only consistency was him ending a scene as a clown."	
6882,"YES Jenny I'm so glad you made a video about this"	
6883,"holy fuck was she bit in the face by a dog when she was a kid or something?"	
6884,"I don't think it was pennywise but the actor who had never seen or heard of clowns before accepting the role. Thanks in part to the 1990s big tobacco cases that banned phillip morris from promoting clowns to children and the truth about clowns campaign."	
6885,"Never trust a man with large shoes.. \n\n\n.. my dad put on his size 11's and walked out on us"	
6886,"Look, someone who didn't read the book. How could this very simple concept of a movie elude you? My 9 year old kept up, I thought you were intelligent... Or is that just what you keep wanting us to think that? Also, 42 percent of people are afraid of clowns. And pennywise got greedy and wanted all those kids and he built up their fear for too long. Clearly to his down fall... Do you even pay attention to the movies you watch or just pick up shit you wanna bitch about to be a hipster?"	
6887,"Hey! This was fun. I'm curious, did you enjoy the movie?"	
6888,"Honestly, if I hadn't read the book and had only seen the movie, I wouldn't give a shit about who the kids were and what happened to them. Like the movie was 2 hours long and we barely learned anything about our main characters."	
6889,"Just watched the 90s version.  The talking head in the fridge, shaking and yelling WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE! was a reoccurring thing in my childhood nightmares.  Looking forward to the new film."	
6890,"Soooooo, did you like it?"	
6891,"YES! My biggest problem with most horror movies is how illogically the murderers behave. Why would you toy with your victims in a way that implies there is an audience watching? Unless......are the monsters aware of us, the moviegoers? Is Pennywise's food actually our approval as the audience? Dun dun dun!!!"	
6892,"Deadpan, deeply perceptive, ironic, hilarious and very clever. Not sure if we deserve you, Jenny (meant in a good way)."	
6893,"This movie was great though"	
6894,"What are you looking for is reference to which pill was Eddie looking for."	
6895,"I'm new here"	
6896,"I thought you were going to talk about punk rock. Gotta be honest, I'm a little disappointed. :("	
6897,"OMG, the guy is trying, give him a break!"	
6898,"Love the kitty outfit! Also, I hate clowns because of Pennywise."	
6899,"Clown doing upper body work = not scary, clown on leg day = scary."	
6900,"He prolongs the scares because he's intimidated by the group. 7 being a number of significance, he can't get through to them like he can with Georgie who was alone"	
6901,"Also he sees ur fear cause he has telepathy (he is a alien)"	
6902,"Pennywise was scared of the Losers because he knew they had the power to kill him if they stuck together, so he wanted Henry to kill some of them first"	
6903,"So everything from this point back is Pre-Porg. You can tell by the hollow and soulless look in her eyes."	
6904,"Oh how I wish, not for the first time, that I hadn't read the godawful Youtube comments."	
6905,"Pennywise likes play with his food. There, 65% of the plot holes are covered."	
6906,"If I had a penny for every beep beep is from the book comment on here I'd be penny wise"	
6907,"You would already have a Porg plush lol"	
6908,"Yummy."	
6909,"Pennywise likes floating."	
6910,"You are gorgeous"	
6911,"Stop trying to make Twisty Slides happen Pennywise!"	
6912,"Marry me"

6919,"Great stuff as usual... :)"	
6920,"Jenny is Pennywise, but occasionally she is Porg foolish."	
6921,"I like this."	
6922,"Sarcasm for most of the duration of this video... a big dislike from me. Just say it suck already if you hate it so much.. rather than beating around the bush like some b**ch!"	
6923,"😃 That was... funny? I didn't laugh, but I'm pretty sure this was funny."	
6924,"Long time watcher, first time commenter. Your awesome. That is allz"	
6925,"You're beautiful and a nerd.  <3"	
6926,"This feels nitpicky and lacks the acerbic wit of your other videos.  It's just griping.   Everybody gripes.  Be better."

7049,"Ingrid, what is the lipstick you're wearing in the video? I've been trying to find a shade like that for ages and it's been a trial and error kind of thing because, as you pointed out, you can't try drugstore makeup out before buying it so I've been getting these shades and have been really disappointed. Also, is that lipstick you have something you would recommend?"	
7050,"What camera lens and settings are you using? It looks amazing!"

7323,"I'm all for not hating your body but if your heart can't take it then you have a problem. There are no 80-year-old large ladies or gents."	
7324,"It's somewhat important to remember that sending people free stuff is advertising just as much as starting a campaign with commercials and ads and such	 and paying people to share your product just by giving it to them can be both _much_ cheaper _and_ more effective than the more traditional techniques. (Even without expectation that you'll tell anyone you got it, the simple fact that people have a natural/social impetus to say thank you for a gift means that shotgunning a bunch of these out to people with audiences, it's probably well worth it to the brand.)\n\nI've encountered concern about the ethics of this sort of advertising--when brand deals, which pay _much_ more, are also a thing, this technique starts to seem pretty dodgy. Especially since it's an appeal to the brand's supposed generosity (which I suppose isn't always fake--you may well simply have a fan at Google who added you to that list, for example)
7325,"What happened to Pete? I feel like I have been missing the fact that they split up for ages!! 😯"	
7326,"I know your instagram isn't a body positivity page but I do exactly what you do with Megan and go to yours as you are so comfortable in your own skin and i identify with you and your body type a lot... YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL thank you <3"	
7327,"Your eyebrows have got so good I am shook"	
7328,"The whole body positive movement is just an excuse for unhealthy habits"	
7329,"How to be happy sounds so good but it doesn't come out until march I want to cry"	
7330,"I have the same t-shirt!"	
7331,"Ah yes the body positivity movement, the only movement that requires no movement."	
7332,"Just saw you on the tube! Now kicking myself that I didn't say Hi. I didn't want u to think I was weird jumping to say hello as soon as I got on the train! :( maybe next time I'll have the courage!"	
7333,"So glad you're happy to be home, and that you're happy in yourself. You reminded me so much of your brother throughout that though, I must say. Which isn't a bad thing? I'm just saying. :) xxx"	
7334,"You deserve all the best. I love you're videos."	
7335,"The body positive movement and Megan literally changed my life. There really aren't words are there?"	
7336,"With you amazing voice I have to make my request. Can you do Ave Maria? I can't get enough of all the songs you do but something touching but sad like that or Bottom of the River is what my soul needs. You voice is hauntinly beauitufl so please consider it!"	
7337,"Carrie! I'm so glad you shared this. Her Instagram feed is honestly so inspiring! I'm so glad to have that in my life now. Those books sound wonderful (and you nailed the pronunciation of Como the first time you said it!) - you're 100% deserving of receiving it all!"	
7338,"Are you high because where is your energy coming from?"	
7339,"In love with Carrie's makeup and figure lately. She looks so mature yet graceful. Feel like I've watched you grow up from your old videos with Dan and Phil and the Vamps to now lol. Always be one of my YouTube faves🤗"	
7340,"Home is fab. Glad you get to chillax at home for abit."	
7341,"I love homey, comforting videos like this ❤ I can't imagine how nice it would feel to finally be home after so long!"	
7342,"Going to see you tomorrow 😊😊😊😊"	
7343,"Hahaha. The last clip was just too adorable. Thank you for making the best videos. 💗"	
7344,"How to be happy really sounds like the plot of the game The Cat Lady. Beautiful game, you should all check it out!"	
7345,"WTF Carrie? Why do you have body image issues? Your body is amazing. You're so thick, and proportionate, and have curves in all the right places. I know naturally thick girls who managed to make themselves skinny that don't look nearly as good that way. Why not just look as good as you can for your body type? I mean, your body type is pretty awesome."	
7346,"I started crying at the end when you started talking about home because I've only just left home for the first time to start college across the country. Everything's wonderful except my brother and dad and mum and old friends are missing. There's nowhere like home.\nSaw you in Dublin a few weeks ago by the way - you were sensational, as per usual"	
7347,"See you in Belfast in October!"	
7348,"The first Disney song would be 'Under the Sea' because The Little Mermaid is the best!! :D <3"	
7349,"I like your vlogs a lot, but I LOVE these sitdown videos. Happy you made one!"	
7350,"The Google bit at the end was so cute. Lol."	
7351,"I've miss your chatty videos and your sofa! Welcome back Carrie"	
7352,"Adore how excited you got by the speaker at the end😂"	
7353,"I'd laugh so hard if you received some Coca Cola through the PO box from Oliver XD"	
7354,"You seem so happy and excited to be home and that instantly makes me feel happy just from the vibes you give off, you're amazing 💜💜💜"	
7355,"I want that speaker! Omg omg it's brilliant!"	
7356,"does anyone else think that's the Wednesday lipstick ? xxx"	
7357,"Don't take home for granted is something I've come to realise in the past few weeks. I've been working all over central and Southern Scotland and though I've seen cool places, I find myself craving the little corner of the world I call home and am always super happy to be back 🏠"	
7358,"Carrie kinda speaks and has the vibe of my history teacher! She is so passionate about things"	
7359,"This video really made me smile. I just noticed it when the video was over. It must have been you 	)"
7360,"So good to see you home Carrie! <3 Missed that big ole purple sofa!"	
7361,"Welcome Home - I don't know how you could be away for so long!  I'd miss my bed too much.  And excellent choice for Google Home to play :)"	
7362,"I just started reading your new book and I CANT WAIT!!"	
7363,"Carrie you are basically my favourite human being and youtuber and my awesome honorary big sister and never let anyone tell you anything mean. Thanks so much for my manual for growing up, All I know now. Keep smiling and keep being......EPIC!!!!!"	
7364,"Why is How to be Happy by Eva Woods not being published till august of next year :,( It sounds so FANTASTIC"	
7365,"How Carrie feels for megan is how I feel for Carrie"	
7366,"The end of this video made me smile so hard 😁"	
7367,"I love my google home!!!!! They are so good!"	
7368,"I love that you mentioned Jonny and Lucy's wedding. Lucy works for Rock Choir which i go to and currently am working towards myself and so i knew Lucy but had no idea she was engaged to Jonny until I saw Gary's photo on Instagram! Such a small world, hope you had a lovely day <3"	
7369,"For a second I thought Carrie had used a green screen because she missed her flat so much."	
7370,"Carrie, your glasses are SO cute! Sorry if you've answered this before, but where did you get them / what brand /style are they? (Or does anyone else in the comments know? I'm in the market for cuter glasses!)"	
7371,"I just sent a letter in the post to you today! Hope you like it! 😋"	
7372,"I love your t shirt"	
7373,"I don't know what it is but something tells me that Carrie is happy to be home. 	-)"
7374,"thank you carrie for introducin me to megan jayne crabbe, i'm in tears scrolling through her instagram <3!!!!"	
7375,"I'm sure hundreds of people have already asked this, but what lipstick are you wearing -I need it?! Love the video and I will never take home for granted xx"	
7376,"My hubby got me an Alexa for my birthday back in April. I think he had more fun playing with it than I necessarily did but it's handy for things like setting a timer from the naughty step for my 3 year old lol. Random things I have to do each day lol. Oh that How To Be Happy book sounds kind of sad but that one and the Body Positive ones are going on my Wishlist. Possible purchase once I get through my Book Club book - oh my days it's hard work!"	
7377,"Interesting I have a arc of the same book but it is called Something Like Happy, instead of How to be Happy, weird. I guess in the States and Canada the name is different."	
7378,"Really loving that lipstick colour. What colour is it? Happy that you get to spend some time at home and I hope you feel better after a sleep in you own bed."	
7379,"Carrie, just as you feel at home and relieved to be home in the purple flat, watching your videos makes me so much happier. Your videos make me so relaxed and happy and just thank you so so much, love you honorary big sister ❤"	
7380,"Home Is Where The Heart Is"	
7381,"Hi Carrie & all of her lovely followers! I just started a podcast with my best friend called Shipwrecked all about fictional relationships & the fandoms that inspire them! I would love for you to check it out. We have episodes on Sanvers, Bughead, Ezria, Disney, and Dandy so far! Our next episode comes out October 3 all about Ron and Hermione (proud Hufflepuff here!). Anyways, here's the link if you'd like to check us out :) https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/shipwrecked/id1228774307?mt=2"	
7382,"I just came home to my flat after about 2 weeks.. and even though this isn't as long as you've been away from your flat, I can 100% relate to you right now! This is the first video I've watched since I arrived here and it filled me with even more joy about being home :D\nEnjoy this feeling, because I most certainly will!\n\nHave a nice day, Carrie :)\nLots of Love from Munich!"	
7383,"as much as I love Watch Me Wednesdays I've really missed these sit-down, chatty videos!"	
7384,"When I saw the title and the book, I guessed you were recommending that, but I thought you'd seen something BAD outrageous and were having one of your few rants!!"	
7385,"the slight aggression when telling us to follow megan was just great ++ megan is a queen"	
7386,"You're a youtuber Carrie! Youtube is owned by Google that's why!!! lol So cool!"	
7387,"Thank you for the suggestion! I just ordered Megan's book on amazon, should be in tomorrow 	)"
7388,"Carrie your face when e speaker plays little mermaid is pure joy :) nice to see you home, and as someone else has said you deserve everything as you are the busiest woman I know and I'm a mum to a 3 year old hahahaha. Keep smiling x"	
7389,"Absolutely love your blogs, your performing and your books, girl! And you're a Gryffindor, like me! I wish I could have a voice like yours one day 💖"	
7390,"Carrie!! It's fantastic to see that you're home sweet home.. but I'm also panicking a little as I am coming to watch the Addams Family on Sat and have been really looking forward to seeing you perform. Please please please tell me you'll be back with the cast by then?! Glad you're getting a well earned rest and home visit though, you certainly deserve it xxx 💜 xxx"	
7391,"Welcome home, Carrie! All of these books sound great. I want to read them all."	
7392,"Ah, I've missed seeing your pretty purple flat! 💜"	
7393,"Book openings are great videos!! As are all of yours xxx"	
7394,"The sheer joy of that speaker when under the sea comes on 😂😂 love this!!!"	
7395,"I was just thinking the other day of how I hoped you'd do another bookish post soon, and here we are! I would gladly watch you talk about books for ages. Definitely ordering the Body Positivity book and How to be Happy. Enjoy your time at home! ♥"	
7396,"I literally react the EXACT same way about Megan, I actually cannot find the words to describe how much of an impact she has had on my life and well being like holy crap, what a fucking incredible human being. I've followed her for just over a year and honestly, she means the world for me. You and Megan are honestly my idols in life, you have both had such a wonderful and incredible impact on my life in SO many ways I will never ever be able to find the words to thank you both."	
7397,"Home doesn't feel so good when had to give your kitchen to a massive spider and it's not possible anymore to get food from your own fridge.😭"	
7398,"Hi Carrie\n\nI recently watched you in Manchester for the Addams Family U.K. Tour, and I just wanted to say how amazing you were and how much I enjoyed it. Also meeting you after the show made my whole year. You are such an amazing role model and have inspired me so much.\n💜🖤💜🖤💜"	
7399,"Biggest inspiration in my life just now. Thank you Carrie for being your amazing self x"	
7400,"As someone who is going to have to move away from home part time for work, I totally understand how you feel about coming home. I'll be moving within the next two or three weeks, and now every time I go to bed I have a little panic about having to learn to sleep in a different bed."	
7401,"I love how natural and fun your videos are. This was great. Thanks Lovely."	
7402,"Luuuuuv you"	
7403,"https://youtu.be/ICiSDqXmWgA"	
7404,"Why is this trending!"	
7405,"KYS"	
7406,"Fabulous 😀"	
7407,"what is your beautiful lipstick shade? <3"	
7408,"I love Megan too, yess!!"	
7409,"Aaaaw I've missed your home videos <3"	
7410,"Foloppy"	
7411,"I'm herre again, Carrie. Hugs inclusive!"	
7412,"💜💜💜💜"	
7413,"Nice"	
7414,"Following Bodyposipanda ✅"	
7415,"Hahaha my phone reacted when you said ok Google lol,"	
7416,"You deserve all the happiness in the world carrie. You're such a positive and inspirational person. Whenever im feeling down i watch your videos and they instantly make me so happy. I know that we all have those bad days but you are so beautiful inside and out xxx 💜💜"	
7417,"Would you please be able to talk about what happened with Pete? 🙁"	
7418,"Fuck this guy and everyone like him. Complaining about Republicans the entire time but still somehow enamored by Donald Trump. Sure, Hillary wasn't amazing but if you took one look at her policies compared with Trump, how the fuck could you even consider trump. Ken Bone, I hope you fucking die of a horribly slow and painful cancer, along with your entire family and everyone you ever appreciated in this world. Fuck you."	
7419,"I used to think Ken Bone was a dumbass, but he's actually pretty intelligent. He's also smart enough to never tell anyone who he voted for, not because he cares about influencing people. Please. Because as soon as anyone knows who he voted for, his value goes way down. He's the undecided poster child. He has to maintain that undecided aura."	
7420,"I'm sorry I'm distracted by the hair sticking out of the side of Bills head :-)"	
7421,"He's wearing a red sweater. That's saying something."	
7422,"The US has interfered in foreign elections four more times than any other foreign country try to interfere with us elections. You folks have to do your research."	
7423,"Shit I thought this was old"	
7424,"Clinton is a two faced, pandering, corrupt, shill, lying piece of political shit. There's no reason to like her. She's the most fake person I've ever seen run for president"	
7425,"I think Bill thought this interview would go differently than it did."	
7426,"He voted for McCain, he voted for Romney, he voted for Hillary. All the same. Unfortunately, the guy we thought was going to be different ended up being the same too (Obama)."	
7427,"Don't be fooled by the undecided voter deal.  He's a pathetic, timid, weak pawn of the establishment to move along their agenda while publicly whoring himself out for money/attention/fame.  He also wears red sweaters on tv and agrees to talk to people who publicly mock him openly on national TV and he acts like nothing is wrong.  He's clearly a Democrat."	
7428,"Ken Bone for President!!💪"	
7429,"Bill Maher, you fucking suck... Ken Bone? Really? Why don't you invite some real progressives on your show like Cenk Uygur, or Lee Camp, or Glen Greenwald (haven't seen him in a while), or Chris Hedges? No, you invite crazy right wingers, establishment lefties, celebs, and fucking memes like Ken Fucking Bone. You used to be be an actual progressive voice, Bill Maher, and now you're just a fucking out-of-touch retard."	
7430,"Hes not hard to understand. He is the average American when it comes to political thinking. The majority of our country doesnt care about how ppl live their own lifes. We don't care about political bullshit. We just want it to work how its supposed to."	
7431,"MSNBC is equally as far left as Fox is far right."	
7432,"Ken Bone is a rational human being. Bounced on my boy's rationality for hours."	
7433,"The Gettable? i don't even know that word exist lol"	
7434,"Lmao, ​let it fucking go, Bill! Jesus, Hillary was a bad candidate stop reaching and move on broski!"	
7435,"Look I didn't vote for either disaster in this past election...and I didn't vote for the escaped mental patients called Jill Stein and Gary Johnson either...but the fact that Maher cannot even grasp why people dislike/despise Hillary shows me that he is out of touch and clueless about what many Americans think"	
7436,"sorry bill, you're funny and all that, but this guy has a much more politically open mind than you..wake up"	
7437,"He's right...80 days for elections in Canada is too long. If you can't articulate your positions and sell yourself in 80 days...you don't deserve to be elected"	
7438,"Ken Bone.  Man of the sweater.  Lover of prego porn.  lol."	
7439,"He voted Trump. Any other answer would have gotten him a round of applause, and he'd have no problem saying it in public. He's not stupid, he doesn't want leftist mobs coming after him."	
7440,"Of course you're confused by Ken Bone, Bill...he represents the future of balanced political thinking."	
7441,"Ken Bone is an idiot that loves attention.  I know he says he doesn't, but you can tell he's one of those people that acts all undecided so he'll get focused on.  Everything he was saying he believes in politically like taxing corporations and rich people more is Democratic ideology, yet he still says he's not a Democrat.  We're in a sad state when this putz becomes a viral hero."	
7442,"I like how Ken was making clear the whole time that this interview shouldn't take place"	
7443,"towards the end bill completely disrespects Ken by talking about him as if he wasn't talking to the man himself"	
7444,"A seemingly intelligent man with an open mind? HE'S A WITCH.... BURN 'IM.... BURN 'IM!"	
7445,"Ken Bone is legit the definition of a nice man."	
7446,"Tell us, plebian - why don't you like us?"	
7447,"The guy is an idiot. Its cute how he thinks he really has the power to significantly influence people though. Still, I won't put anything past this country anymore!"	
7448,"Could not agree with Bone's my vote is my business. We need more of it. Especially from celebrities and news anchors and reporters. In fact I would suggest that all famous people should not be allowed to vote. Because they are biased."	
7449,"Please don't feed him anymore he is about to explode."	
7450,"Ken Bone is just trumps Joe the plumber."	
7451,"Ken Boone, was one of the better guests in recent memory."	
7452,"Holy shit. Going back to rewatch this piece i cant help but be reminded how much se cupp ruined this episode. Her suck is even intenser. This was a nice interview. Why do we need to know his vote? He is right idc and there are dummies that would care too much. He had good answers."	
7453,"The guys a good dude"	
7454,"If the Dems want to get guys like this maybe they ought to push American ideals like production,  the Individual,  freedom and prosperity instead of their usual left wing,  collectivism.   Pathetic. \n\nYou know He voted for Trump!   MAGA bitches."	
7455,"You know what?  Fuck this guy.  Why are this small minority of people who are so lame that they couldn't make up their mind in such a polarizing election suddenly become the only people who are catered to and ultimately, choose the political future of our country?"	
7456,"Seems like Bill was regretting bringing Ken Bone on the show by the end of the interview."	
7457,"OH GOD I WAS MOLESTED BY A REL ESTATE LADY"	
7458,"Bill's impression of his own influence on the electorate is the most hilarious thing about him. I'll be honest with yuh	 I have a dog in this fight: I wanna convince you. One minute within earshot of Bill's Maheronic audience tells even the most politically ignorant sap exactly whom Maher controls: those who already agree with what little he actually has to say."
7459,"Time to make the doughnuts."	
7460,"Ken is much more articulate and personable than I had imagined."	
7461,"News to me. Only white people are presumed innocent I guess."	
7462,"From his last statement you know he voted for Hillary :)"	
7463,"I guess Ken Bone has been hit with so many political discussions he's learned how to handle himself. Bill Maher was getting frustrated with him. But I think Mr Bone was one of clearest thinkers I've seen on any show in recent years. If he was the average voter we'd have a chance of returning to a political system that could almost work again. Mr Bone has successfully bridged what to most people is a fixed, unbridgeable partisan political divide. Good for you, Ken."	
7464,"This Ken Bone dude has quite a good view on those political shenanigans. He hold is ground with gusto!"	
7465,"Real time with Ken Bone"	
7466,"Bill. This guy actually has a lot of intelligence, and very libertarian. I don't understand why, in this interview, you're being a dick to him. He speaks as a normal voter. I don't agree with everything he says, but he spoke it all very well and explained his thinking very straight forward"	
7467,"This dude restored my faith in America"	
7468,"Maybe because Hillary Clinton went MIA during the campaign and Trump was having double header rallies in the swing states. Don't underestimate the power of likeability, or unlikeability in her case."	
7469,"Stop trying to make Ken Bone a thing."	
7470,"You must have been molested by a real estate agent...😆😭😵"	
7471,"I put off watching this video because I thought it would be cringy. Wound up being an intelligent, honest, non confrontational conversation. Just a well spoken regular guy on  TV. Refreshing."	
7472,"I love when straight up people with zero agenda like this guy just baffels Politicians and Bill Maher. They just don't get it when people are human beings."	
7473,"At the end he basically said he voted for Hillary."	
7474,"That Homer Simpson moron voted for Trump. If you can't recognize that Trump is a scumbag that is unfit for office you are part of the problem. Trump is a failed president."	
7475,"He voted for Johnson and threw away his vote.  There's making a statement and being honest about who you are and then there's doing your part to prevent a woefully unqualified imbecile from becoming POTUS.  I chose the latter because I was really scared.  Johnson didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning."	
7476,"Everything Trump does is the greatest ever, classic narcissistic personaltiy"	
7477,"I thought this would be humorous..\nBut damn. I think Bill Maher got his ass kicked by Kenn Bone. This was awesome."	
7478,"Hillary Clinton is no centrist. She's a corporatist. What's centrist about that?"	
7479,"Why do people care what this fat piece of shit pedophile looking man who can't find his own dick thinks?"	
7480,"Why people hated Hillary Clinton? Benghazi, the trail of body's, her pure evil self, the email scandal."	
7481,"I am not sure why Bill Maher was trying to make a sales pitch. I think he is very knowledgeable on most things and you could have a debate with him without getting all worked up. I think people need to go in a discussion with an open mind instead of trying to preach or change one's opinion."	
7482,"He always gives me a full boner"	
7483,"The GOP has in a roundabout way succeeded in Gerrymandering the Electoral College, that is why they won."	
7484,"Independence = Freedom. Take from it what you will."	
7485,"This man needs to run in 2020. I'd vote for him if I was an American, but I can't because I'm British and sensible"	
7486,"It's amazing how Ken Bone appears more composed than Bill  Maher."	
7487,"I don't understand the praise of this man. Really? You were undecided after listening to Trump's grab 'em by the _____ hot-mic moment? You were undecided after learning Trump deliberately barged into the dressing rooms of underage girls' pageants? After mocking a reporter with a disability? After the Trump University scam? After using charity funding to settle personal legal disputes?"	
7488,"Interesting interview. I thought at first this guy was a joke, but I enjoyed hearing his perspective."	
7489,"Works at the power plant? Boner Simpson?"	
7490,"So Bill doesn't know why Hillary isn't liked? She voted for the Iraq war, tpp, is being funded by Sadie Arabia, voted for the wall between Mexico and the USA, voted for more war if she was president and she doesn't know why people dont like her? By the way trump would of done the same thing that Hillary did because he said it in interviews and was making deals with Sadie Arabia during the primary and as president was bought off by them #bernieorbust"	
7491,"Ken bone for 2020!"	
7492,"4:48 Bill being a presumptuous dick"	
7493,"Ken Bone is my idol"	
7494,"Stopped watching Bill Maher long time ago, only watching cause of Bone lol, and now I remember why. I am a leftist from Scotland and if Bill doesn't know why people hated Hillary then he is as blind as a bat. A war mongering, curupt, corpatist that would have pushed a more neo liberal set of policies that would, as usual, decimate the quality of life of the working class. I hate Trump also. Wouldn't have voted for either of them."	
7495,"I don't believe for a second that this guy was undecided."	
7496,"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1260/0958-305X.25.8.1455"	
7497,"Based Bone"	
7498,"Bill Maher is just annoying."	
7499,"So many ignorant people... Ken Bone is ignorant. Voting Gary Johnson is retarded. Those who hated Hillary for being too right wing fell for Russian propaganda on the internet, then there are the butthurt communists who can't handle moderation. And I HATED hillary and am conservative but Hillary was the only logical choice in 2016. Those who voted for Trump are braindead."	
7500,"The comment on the racist Criminal inJustice System got the thumbs up."	
7501,"Bill she isn't a centrist, she is center-right. She is a corporate democrat bitch, neo-liberal mongrel that is so incapable of self reflection that she released a book blaming everyone else but herself for her lose in 2016. You have such a huge blind spot for her and it annoys the hell out of me."	
7502,"Courting idiots like Ken Bone is the reason democrats lost the election. Democrats should be trying to get the votes of progressives by offering them policies that will actually improve their lives like single payer healthcare, affordable education, election reform, raising the minimum wage and job creation. If they did that they'd never lose a presidential election again. Stop trying to win the vote of indecisive idiots like Ken and focus on trying win back the vote of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party."	
7503,"Ken Bone is boning all the pussies at this point"	
7504,"OMG Dave Chappelle was spot on! LOL!!!\nhttps://youtu.be/ofnSojq-vqI?t=33m37s"	
7505,"Ken!"	
7506,"https://www.facebook.com/goalcast/videos/1557254357685082/"

7922,"This is for when the car accelerates.  Have you ever had something on your dash and started out real fast, everything gets dumped on the floor.  This weight when the car accelerates quickly will cause the door to be held shut preventing everything inside from coming out."	
7923,"What an utterly pointless video. This deserved some recognition?"

Always have to park on uphill slope when I get home from minimum wage job....can't open goddamn storage unit if I'm not level, so needless to say I often have to leave valuables behind until the next day to retrieve.   One day I leave my prized anime cards behind after forgetting to open latch during a level straight away.  Park near studio apartment.  Storage unit is rendered useless.   Cards are in the car overnight.   That night there is a BLM protest on my block.  Car gets set ablaze.  Cards are gone forever.   \nGet on youtubes to find solace, comfort and maybe some seductively soothing ASMR.....instead find a fidgety dork honoring the Honda engineers for this this blatant quality control oversight.   \nDecide to take pills and wait for the sweet release of death.

8118,"Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise is the best clown performance since Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight"	
8119,"Nothing, I don't get that scared."	
8120,"I enjoyed this take on the movie but it was a Comedy.\nI didn't find this penny wise as terrifying as Tim Currys.\nAnd I didn't understand why his head kept getting bigger I some scenes.\nThe George scenes was good and I didn't think they would go there.\nAnd l believe the George and bill truly loved each other the as for the friends.\nIt was bull, no friend that are bought together by bullies would act like that towards each other.\nAlso spinning the camera or shaking the camera doesn't make this the most terrifying movie you will see this year.\nWell I hope not or the horror genre is done.\nI rate this comedy 7/10."	
8121,"Mike was supposed to be the historian but they gave his important role to the fat kid. I preferred the book because he was one of the few black characters in fiction given development, racism in the 80s was addressed, and he wasn't stereotypical, but in this movie they tokenized him."	
8122,"Was that the creature in rudolf the red nosed reindeer?  The bumble?  I saw that as a kid and it seriously freaked me out.  It scared me.  The stop motion added to the creep factor.  For me it was something that stuck in my head for years afterwards.  Now at 49 its still creepy and yeah I wouldn't want to see it in a dark alley."	
8123,"A whale, it would turn into a whale and i'll die isntantly"	
8124,"YES! A boggart is immediately what I thought of when they started incorporating their individual fears. I can't help but wonder if JK Rowling read this at some point and that's how the idea of a boggart formed."	
8125,"Pennywise's friendliness is basically like a shield. It only works once, before your cover's blown."	
8126,"the worst thing that IT could be is to shape shift into is Chris stuckman wearing a jeremy Jahns disguise trying to give a movie review on as good as jeremy jahns but failing horribly! lololol"	
8127,"If It bleeds... we can kill It."	
8128,"It would turn into fant4stic dvd if its gonna hunt me."	
8129,"It would turn into an accountant telling me to fill my time sheets for the week"	
8130,"Pinhead  from hellraiser, that will be my worst nigthmare."	
8131,"Once you finish the book, can you do a Spoiler Review of It?:)"	
8132,"To answer your question honestly, as a kid it would have been a swarm of wasps or yellow jackets. When I was 8 I went outside to play one day while my brother and another kid from the neighborhood threw rocks at a hive of yellow jackets. The yellow jackets attacked them and when they ran across the street in my direction I was stung several times. Didn't know it at the time but I was allergic to bee stings, this caused me to swell up bad and be admitted to the hospital. Up until the time I was in high school I had a huge fear of bees and the thought of being stung again. I outgrew it and faced my fear but during the age those kids were it would have been that."	
8133,"The creature from the black lagoon does not kill a bully he kills an abused kid but other than that you are right about him being the creature the whole time. I can't wait till you see what IT really is !!!!!! Sorry the book nerd in me just came out :-D"	
8134,"i don´t think that the reason Pennywise did not killed Beverly was because she was not scared, i think that it had to do with the fact that he realized that she is not longer a kid, because right before he was going to killed her he smelled something, it It was supposed to only eat kids at this point, or at least that is what i felt like for me"	
8135,"the reason beverly woke up from the kiss was because she was afraid on unconsented sexual relations from her father which was the only thing she feared more than pennywise, however when ben kissed her she wasn't afraid because it was out of actual love compared to her father and it kind of broke the 'tripping balls' state she was in."	
8136,"Better than the Original"	
8137,"Glad to hear you're reading the book, when you finish it can you do a video on it. Thatd be dope"	
8138,"I swear when they do the sequel to It I can totally see Amy Adams playing the grown up version of the red headed girl in this movie"	
8139,"The pharmacy scene where Beverly says the man looks like Clark Kent & he says she's lois lane and everyone in the cinema just cringed and went ew"	
8140,"If you add a bit of film grain to your backgrounds it would get rid of the banding, or some slight noise ~ probably make your videos look cleaner"	
8141,"I would totally love to see you review the book. Have fun with the ending for part 1."	
8142,"Pretty sure this movie gave me PTSD on top of my PTSD\nFucking awesome movie though"	
8143,"I heard it wasn't that good. I heard the IT character really wasn't that scary. Not only that, it gives no explanation as to why this creature has to come out and feed every 27 years.  Any of the other decent horror movies atleast has a reason why they do what they do. Freddie was killed in a furnace, Krampus exists to teach bad children a lesson. What is IT's reason? And if he's a spider again, that's going to be soooo fucking lame! :P"	
8144,"it would turn into taxes or an empty bank account 😔"	
8145,"I am legitimately afraid of fame (no really, I'm actually serious. Not having your own privacy ever again, being stalked by some overly crazy fans to where you feel like your life is threatened, people thinking they have the right to your image, eyes following your every move, taking pictures, not sure whether people love you for the fame or for yourself, never able to be just another face in the crowd again, etc. It's all very terrifying and awful to me. I would work hard my whole life to never be famous).\n\nSo would that mean _It_ would show up in the form of Lady Gaga and tell me I'm going on tour with her?"	
8146,"Pretty sure Jeremy just said the word it a thousand times lol"	
8147,"This movie was fucking ruined for me.\nI haven't been to the theaters since 2015 and i don't plan to ever go again in the future.\nPEOPLE, I PAY TO WATCH A MOVIE IN THEATERS, NOT TO HEAR YOU FUCKS TALK OR HECKLE!!!!\n\nLiterally everyone was laughing like this was a fucking comedy. There was parts where it was dead serious and\npeople couldn't stop laughing. Even had people yelling out comments during the movie. \n\nI'm just going to watch the second movie at home. I hate inconsiderate people!"	
8148,"It turning into a Giant Wasp, Hornet or Yellow Jacket Bees.  That would scare the hell out of me."	
8149,"It is a fucking alien, in the book"	
8150,"What I really like about this movie is how Billy went through the five stages of grief. \n\nDenial-Doesn't believe that Georgie is dead\n\nAnger-Lashes out his friends on not helping him finding Georgie\n\nBargain-Putting his friend's lives on the line all over in finding Georgie\n\nDepression-Both his bargain and anger cost his friendship for a short time.\n\nAcceptance-Accepting the fact that Georgie is dead and shot Pennywise in the forehead while he took the form of Georgie.\n\nSeriously, was anyone on the verge in tears when Georgie was killed, follow by Billy finding Georgie and wanting to go home?"	
8151,"Do u agree that girl in that painting looks like mama?"	
8152,"The thing goes KA KA Ka poom poom , I said the mans not hot !"	
8153,"I would see my wife"	
8154,"im scared of death and failure that's it"	
8155,"A giant moth. Like the size of a dog, or a car, or a bus. If you've ever seen a picture a moth up close, you know that shit would be scary as fuck if it were huge."	
8156,"A giant spider like from jumanji but bigger"	
8157,"Sophia Lillis was so good in the movie as Bev. She's gonna conquer Hollywood one day with her amazing talent."	
8158,"And stop using that stupid ass Harry Potter reffrence if anything a Bogert or whatever is a copy of IT.."	
8159,"there is one fear that still sometimes freaks me out... and that is the dead mangled Body of Emmett Till. I saw it in school when i was in 6th grade and the teachers had to make sure i was out of the room if they showed it.... sometimes i still have nightmares and that image is there.  OORR... there was a Sherlock Homes mystery exhibit that went around called the Clock tower mystery, and there was a mannequin upside down dead  all chained up in a box.... scariest shit ever!!!!!! if anyone knows what I'm talking about.... that shit was scary to a kid."	
8160,"That scene after Beverly kills her father in the bathroom was the worst jumpscare I ever had in my life, I even lost my breathe for a few seconds! O.O"	
8161,"It would be a positive error proof test! Terrifying!!"	
8162,"IT would turn into me killing myself"	
8163,"That blood oath at the end though. Dude, this was set in the 80s they showed absolutely no f**king fear about getting AIDS 😳\n\nAlso, is it just me or does the kid playing Stan look like a young version of the late Anton Yelchin 😱\n\nFinally, I think you should play the adult version of Ritchie, Jeremy 😂 Do what you do best 🤣"	
8164,"I just got back from watching IT and it was so good"	
8165,"Georgie was afraid of the dark... Not clowns. That's what IT killed him"	
8166,"I think it would be awesome if Seth Green played Richie considering he was Richie 27 years ago. He's the right age and still pretty funny. It would be awesome to bring the original cast back to tie to two movies together. They would just need a new Billy since the original actor died."	
8167,"For some reason I remember the Creature from the Black Lagoon killing Eddie Corcoran in the book not a bully. Correct me if I'm wrong."	
8168,"Well now that I've seen the movie it would be pennywise lol. I'd literally shit my pants if i saw pennywise because I've seen what he can do and i would not be rational enough to think, don't be afraid because i have no friends to back me up lol"	
8169,"IT is an alien 👽 spider 🕷"	
8170,"The yetti monster from Rudolph scared me as a kid to lol 😂"	
8171,"Then I guess IT will be me. Fuck."	
8172,"If the kid actors in the mini tv show play as the adults in part 2 that would be awesome"	
8173,"I would probly get a form of a spider or some type of giant insect much like the old film. I loved this movie by the way, it was way better than I was expecting which is rare in horrer movies for me."	
8174,"I don't know if my expectations were way too high after seeing all the praise this movie got but man I was so disappointed after seeing this movie. Like it was just so painfully average and cliched throughout the whole movie. Like nothing even happens in it. They see Pennywise, he runs at the camera, next scene. Then they go down the well, hit it with sticks for like 10 minutes and that's it. I dunno man maybe I'm missing something but for me personally, this movie is getting way too much praise. Like not a bad film by any means, just very average."	
8175,"I think It would turn into the Nemesis from RE3 because I was scared of the it."	
8176,"Bryce Dallas Howard better play adult Elizabeth dammit! I wanna see those high heels in action again"	
8177,"I want Molly Ringwald to play Beverly just because of that one gag where Richie snarked about it."	
8178,"I thought it was ok."	
8179,"the thumbnail is a huge spoiler"	
8180,"Why doesn't pennywise just take the form of a giant rock?"	
8181,"Can someone tell me this: What was Ben afraid of exactly? His scene in the library, following easter eggs, then being chased by a headless body... and then in the sewer, IT turned into a mummy...\nSo... is he just afraid of dead bodies or what?"	
8182,"Dude right on the money with that Bumble reference that thing freaked me out when I was a kid..."	
8183,"my biggest fear is clostorfobia or the fear of being in a small space btw what do you think that whould look like"	
8184,"If It came to kill me, It'd probably take the form of the Babadook."	
8185,"I really hope this doesn't bring back the clown waiting in the woods trend."	
8186,"I honestly don't know what my biggest fears are. Ironic. Guess I'll know if I'm ever forced into it"	
8187,"pennywise would turn into you being a accredited film reviewer and having influence over the industry with your shit taste in movies"	
8188,"Why do you wanna know what I'm afraid of???? What are you gonna do with that information??????"	
8189,"good thing they didn't have the sewer orgy"	
8190,"a giant swarm of ants... that's the thing i fear most in life. or larva. basically any swarm of any bug"	
8191,"Multiple rats that climb over me, pennywise could eat me right there because I would be in so much fear."	
8192,"U have really sexy eyes."	
8193,"The scariest scene in the movie for me was the basement scene where Georgie looked muddy and bloody and how pennywise grabbed his body into the water....this movie was great"	
8194,"I was literally thinking she looked like Amy Adams throughout that whole movie."	
8195,"Can Pennywise turn into myself if I'm afraid of myself enough?"	
8196,"Beverly has to end up with the chubby boy"	
8197,"Just wait 27 more years for the child actors to become adults"	
8198,"I like how the director put in mama as one of the monsters."	
8199,"IT would take the form of a mass of darkness, and all I would see is nothing as I felt and heard various things before IT chewed off my fucking face."	
8200,"I actually found the movie to be pretty sad. Seriously, I felt more sad than scared when the kids were attacked because they were so relatable! I felt so bad for georgie when he was crying"	
8201,"batman wouldnt have been afraid"	
8202,"Necromorph from Dead Space."

8235,"He's such an honest, genuine bloke. I wish there were more like him. Great role model for our youth."	
8236,"Put my foot in a boiling geezer Sounds like a bar fight in Manchester"	
8237,"What I've learned is that Ed is a rebel or don't know how to take instructions LOL.  He should watch Keanu's interview here on Graham about that motorcycle accident and learn from the master."

8311,"Rio talks sense. England kid with two golden boots. 50 goals in two years before turning 20. Owen would be neymar level in term of money right now. The fact he's English slaps on another 50mil. At that age, you could not see past him as the next up and coming player. But what happened he got pushed too much too early and could have had a brilliant career that lasted long. Instead it finished up short. Keep young players ticking slowly. Let them develop. Then make him into the player you need"	
8312,"Rooney's been a great player but there's no question that if Michael Owen hadn't been unlucky with injuries throughout his career, he'd currently be way out in front as England's all time leading goal scorer."	
8313,"when hoddle starts to talk about consistency, owen face turned pale lol"	
8314,"I agree completely but you've got to remember Woodburn and Rashford aren't getting the game time that Owen was. Yes Rashford is playing a lot but now he's adapting his game to convert to a winger whereas Owen was a striker and woodburn just straight up is getting no game time. Imo Woodburn should go to Swansea or somewhere on loan and he could flourish."	
8315,"At 18 and 19 all the way to 24, just before he went to Madrid, Owen was averaging 18 premier league goals a season, and thats before we factor in cup and european goals...... Football has changed, thats all"	
8316,"Owen had scored 40 PL goals before he turned 20, Rashford isn't on his level and Woodburn lol he's done nothing yet."	
8317,"As a united fan I know Owen played for us but he's a LFC boy through and through and I have to admit early 2000s no better striker than owen this day and age he'd be worth easily 100mil"	
8318,"Michael Owen- great player to traitor to shit pundit"	
8319,"Rio always talks straight. These kids got a long way to go before reaching Owens sensational form as a youngster"	
8320,"That means Rashford and Woodburn is not better than me. - M.Owen"	
8321,"'There & Back' - A Solar Project For UNICEF would be much more entertaining!"	
8322,"Owen was given a chance at a very young age. We don't have that in the game anymore. Players normally make their breakthrough in their early 20s. Money has fucked everything"	
8323,"Judge them at the end of there career"	
8324,"Fair statements Rio.. Owen on his prime ( 19 years old ) was way too better than rashford,  woodburn, kane combined..!!!"	
8325,"Rio is a genius!!! This is exactly what there has been complaints about English Media hyping the youngsters even before they even reach their potential.\nThey need to be tested against time as how consistent they are atleast for 2-3 years to be called anything close to prodigy."	
8326,"This game was in our hands but useless defence cost us"	
8327,"Up the potters"	
8328,"Up d flats"	
8329,"Rio is right. Owen was a world class finisher even in his teens. He had an instinctive, almost preternatural ability to find the back of net. Romario had that too. Mbappe has shown glimpses of that but he needs to do it over the course of a season or two. Rashford is rather different. He's more of a support striker than a poacher number 9."	
8330,"Owen was sick"	
8331,"Why is Woodburn even being mentioned. He scored 1 good goal and suddenly the British media are wanking over him shock horror."	
8332,"English fans and media overhyping youngsters. What's new?"	
8333,"Rio dont even mention Mbappe in this context mbappe has proven his worth in the UCL the biggest competition out there..."	
8334,"rashford has been poor so far this season he's been having episodes of poor games but the English media will try a defend him until he's 24 and done nothing and it will be on to the next  teenager. We should look at how the French bring their young players they don't buss ppl ear with their names. They let talent speak for itself. Personally I don't see the hype in rashford at part from the fact that  the British media are saying his name every week. This is pathetic."	
8335,"Owen was a phenomenal player as a young talent but injuries made him an average player and for me didn't deserve that ballon D'or he won"	
8336,"Rashford is better than Owen or at least he's gonna be.Owen was done by 25 lol"	
8337,"look at these old guys trying to cling on to their past status. haha .... Owen is dogshite compared to the players of today... Rio just bitter because he was always a liability, not as good as a defender like a Pique, luiz or a Terry who are also better then all those past overrated defenders too  (Adams, Campbell, Moore, Cannavaro, Nesta, Hiero, etc ...are all  below their level!)\n\nLuke Shaw is twice the player Maldini ever was (in fact he is better then carlos and maldini combined)\nwhy would you want a dirt player like cafu when you can play a great like Alvares?!?!?!\n\nWho would play overrated rubbish like a Scholes... a Keane... a Viera... < all crap players compared to todays (Hhahahah)\nEven Zidane is looked all rose tinted on... he was also rubbish... players like Coutinho are already better then players like him.\n\nAnd forwards and wingers... the past like to say so called greats like Maradona (the druggie)... Pele (the pervert)... R9.... (the fattie)... Best (the drunk)... Cruyff (the clown).... are better then the grerats cr7 and Messi and Neymar and Mbappe... hahahahaha\n\nIf old players that do punditry like Rio, Owen, Henry, Neville (etc) want to still get involved they can become todays boot cleaners because they were all rubbish and overrated"	
8338,"Who is Owen loool yeah a name in England but nothing in football world get over yourself, England produce Owen and Brazil produce Ronaldo"	
8339,"Hey that's me at 1:43 !!!\n\nWould love to have you on the channel sometime for a drink and some tips on how to git good. My cohost and I are trash at Dark Souls lol\n\nPRAISE THE SUN!!!"

8349,"Okay, let's rundown:\n0:15 - That Rey must be playing an Int build since she's wielding a Moonlight Greatsword. Too bad she appears to be a keyboard turner.\n0:28 - Solaire picking on a Deprived. Bad form.\n0:38 - Only reason that guy survived all those hits is his Mask of the Mother giving him 10% extra HP.\n0:50 - Obvious fat-rolls. Either Solaire is just being ballsy by reducing his invincibility frames, or he bought an item from a stall prior and it's stuffed up his weight ratio.\n1:28 - Solaire summoned in but the group is AFK. Promptly uses Black Separation Crystal to leave.\n1:50 - Silly Solaire. You cannot hurt someone whilst they're resting at a bonfire. What do you think this is, Dark Souls 2?\n2:02 - No damage taken by Solaire's hits? Dirty 'Cheat Engine' users.\n2:21 - I'm guessing Solaire is farming that Man-Serpent Summoner for its Medicant's Staff? Obviously doesn't get it as we never see Solaire with the Sunlight Shield.\n2:35 - Solaire vs. red invader dual-wielding Avelyns.\n2:48 - Solaire breaks his weapon on phase-2 Darklurker. Feels bad man.\n2:56 - Solaire vs. Aldrich, Devourer of Gods.\n3:04 - Picking on 2 harmless undead? WTF Solaire!\n3:14 - Fighting Marvellous Chester is a bad idea, but I understand. We all love that helm for Fashion Souls.\n3:49 - Solaire vs. Elana, Squalid Queen.\n4:05 - Solaire attempts to turn Sailor Moon towards the Sun's grace, but then stabs the filthy Darkmoon.\n4:16 - Solaire learn to fear the Frostbite build.\n4:30 - Using a Greatbow in a close-range fight? Bad idea.\n4:46 - Another invader dual-wielding Avelyns. They're everywhere!\n4:59 - Stop hitting people resting at bonfires, Solaire!\n5:09 - 3 vs. 1. Solaire spell-cancels for a sneaky hit. Lands a devastating blow on Hashirama at 5:30. Absolutely devastating.\n5:38 - Epic PvP battle between Solaire and a Chaos Blade wielder. Close match, but Chaos Blade wielder forfeits due to too much health drained from her own weapon (20HP each hit adds up quickly).\n6:24 - Praise the Sun!"	
8350,"I watched this for longer than is healthy... and longer than I actually played Dark Souls."	
8351,"I seriously want to be his friend oh my god"	
8352,"Now I understand how iframe works. Iframes depict the number of frames in which the opponent is too confused to harm the dodge-roller!"

8376,"where's the estus bro"	
8377,"Pretty funny but you have to be a bit more self-aware about rolling on the ground when there are several women with dresses on. As a guy I found that to be a bit too much. Yes you did it to a ton of different people but its clear that the women were uncomfortable when you started rolling on the floor and some of them specifically pushed their skirts down. Keep it funny but make sure you arent coming across as creepy."

8750,"Has Science have discovered God?\n\nBased on the Harvey and the Irma hurricanes destructive effect on the state of Texas and the state of Florida plus the raging fires of California we could say that God is real and whenever man says that his laws, here in the United States of America, should be above the laws of God then we all get into big, big trouble.\nFor instance, according to the Bible, God made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day (Exodus 20:11). Therefore, God’s authority of how things should be done on earth is much higher than the authority of President Trump, the United States Congress and the United States Supreme Court of Justice and above the authority of all American voters put together. When non-believers in God, as described by the Bible, atheists, secularists and evolutionists take the Bible out of the public square and out of public teaching the influence of God’s Holy Spirit is greatly diminished within the American population and the United States, like other nations where God’s Ten Commandments are ignored and violated generates many assassins, rapists, thieves and people making false accusations against others.\nFor instance, places where we have people with widespread lack of knowledge of who Jesus and His Apostles were plus their specific teachings such as in the Key West, Florida, the crime index measures the rate of crimes in any area on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the safest areas. This area earns a two on that scale. In other words, 98 percent of areas in United States of America are safer than this one, making it the most dangerous area in Key West and one of the most dangerous in the nation. Moreover, places where Jesus’ teachings are widely ignored such as in Houston Texas, we will find out that Houston’s murder numbers are posted for 2016 and they remain at a five-year high. Records show 302 people were killed 2015, leaving behind families who were ripped apart. You'll find that the occurrence of violent crime in Houston, TX is 135% higher than the average rate of crime in Texas and 159% higher than the rest of the nation. Those crimes are committed because God’s authority is diminished in the hearts and minds of people that are highly unfamiliar with God’s Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3-17 and the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the New Testament in the Bible"

9092,"Buttom line... Stephen King can be pretty fucked up to put it mildly."	
9093,"So basically Penywise is just an excuse for Stephen King to write a book about child sex and gore? I'm... starting to think maybe this guy isn't someone I should respect. \nWhatever a writer writes about, the subject matter can be inspired, but ultimately the content of the book is a revealing insight into the mind of the writer... Which means he was writing about 12 year old children having sex, in great detail... he actually planned that shit in advance. \n\nI wonder how many other famous pop culture icons are secretly pedos and  serial kilers. A hell of a lot more than we would think is probably the answer."	
9094,"Now do the mini-series VS the movie. xD"	
9095,"never have that woman again please."	
9096,"Really interested if you all are going to look at the 2017 not-John-Hughes IT."	
9097,"Why do the Beverley in the 2017 vers. have sex with all the boys in the group? That's so DISGUSTING AND VILE that a image of pre-teen GANGBANG just conjured up in my mind. Did the reviewers said they all had sex in the sewers? That just made it WORSE for me now. I gotta to get this out my mind, probably going to watch the original movie again."	
9098,"good intentions\nbut seems a bit dumbed down..."

9101,"Would you like it in alphabetical order????"	
9102,"Who is this chick? Fuck she ruins what was going to be an incredible episode. I genuinely can't tell if she's trying to do a Pennywise high-pitched clown voice for comedic purposes or if that's her actual voice. Either way, she's got a voice for modeling."	
9103,"Seeing the old clips it seems they even brought back the odd lip-syncing for Pennywise, as if the lines were added later. Dunno if that's supposed to be intentional for both movies since It's a cosmic horror, but..."	
9104,"So the only female in the club in the book is a slut. I mean sure the sex orgy was a bonding ritual, but essentially the girl banged more than one boy. Worse in one sequence: one after the other. How did she not get pregnant?"	
9105,"IT is not a demon, but a cosmic being or eldritch abomination like Cthulhu or Gozer from Ghostbusters."	
9106,"CAN YOU PLZ DO A HOMEMADE IT TRAILER!?"	
9107,"Did you legit just say Steven and not Stephen?"

9114,"the dead kid and the picture of Georgie is pretty much like this in the book. The 85 murders begin and then as Mike builds up the evidence to be sure to call his paws one of the things that makes him certain that it's It they are dealing with is the picture of Georgie that disappeared in 58 after it winked at bill"	
9115,"I have never seen a Youtube channel that has more bots spamming it that CineFix."	
9116,"Here's a fun fact:  The kid playing young Richie is Seth Green, known for his voice acting on Robot Chicken.  So voices are his game now."	
9117,"I don't remember Stan brutally chopping himself up in the book.  It's been about five years since I read the book.  Anybody want to fill me in on what happened if I'm wrong?"	
9118,"I wish they kept the them running a train part from the books in the new adaption."	
9119,"Fucking hell, what an annoying ass video. Those narrator/ presenters are awful."	
9120,"13:01 HAHAHAHAHA WTF?? I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT PART AND IM GLAD I DID NOW"	
9121,"With the notable exception of Carrie the only really good adaptations of Stephen King's novels are the non-supernatural ones."	
9122,"Based on the mini series, IT's powers seem to be based in subjective or perceived reality. The silver works because they know it works, the asthma inhaler works when they are kids when he thinks it's acid, then as an adult when he knows its mostly water it doesn't work.\n\nA similar system was actively used by the citizens of Elm St in Freddy vs. Jason. The people suppressed all knowledge of Freddy and his killings and eventually that stripped him of his powers. I don't know if it was an intentional reference to IT though."	
9123,"I like the miniseries. It's cheesy but charming and Mike's arc isn't given to a white character. The woman talking sounds like she has a bubble in her throat but good video"	
9124,"I know a lot of people keep saying Bev was gangbanged in the book but that is just not true.....\nshe had a train ran on her.."	
9125,"I don't remember the spider part"	
9126,"Something, something, kid gang bang, something, something, bad.   Now give me your likes! Everyone else is doing it."	
9127,"9:33 are we gonna ignore the fact that Stephen King as a grown man made a decision to include a group a 12 year olds running a train on another 12 year old girl even though he could've written literally anything else in the story to symbolize that they loved each other"	
9128,"Best Pennywise line - \n\nKiss me fat boy!"	
9129,"Adultery/underage fornication/ the disgusting etc isn't loving.. who taught these kids? Satan?"	
9130,"What's the plural of medium?"

9132,"10:10 *what can Stephen King cut with a 1,000 degree knife?!?!?1!?1?!?!!?1?!?*"	
9133,"Correction: It were THREE bullies that were involved with throwing the homosexual man over the bridge."	
9134,"...And this is why I've never felt inclined to pick up one of his novels. Yeah, they're LONG books... but people don't read books just to say they've carried around a giant weight with words inside and looked at them all. The book trailer or little blurb won't win you over unless you are a die-hard horror fan, maybe. When it comes to what you hear about them outside of that? They sound dull, gross, and pretentious at the same time. I don't see the appeal."	
9135,"9:47 Wasn't it Bill who initiated this?"	
9136,"tim is the only reason this thing was scary"	
9137,"I understand that Stephen King is supposed to be a genius and all but you have to be a really sick fuck to write about children fucking each other"	
9138,"Tip	 drop all the dumb leftie crap like 'm-muh racial insensitivity' and similar."
9139,"The difference to me.... The first was awesome with great acting. The second was lame, not scary at all & Pennywise wasn't half the clown Tim Curry was. Why choose a pretty boy to play what was suppose to be such a scary part? IT from the 90s wins, hands down! Very disappointed in this new one."	
9140,"pennywise isn't a demon, he is  a sickness brought on by the breaking of the beams and the assault on the dark tower by the Crimson King"	
9141,"I liked the older one more.\nJust seemed like the story was easier to follow."	
9142,"You say **ripped his arm off** yet you show us ripping his hand off..."	
9143,"She had sex with everyone in the losers club wtf Steven King wtf..."	
9144,"He should have said quit clowning around and then slammed the book on its hand killing all the scary."	
9145,"oh for the love of, stop fearing clowns, it's the people behind the make-up the ones you should be afraid of."	
9146,"Ya'll barking up da wrong tree\n\ndis clown man isn't bad\nhe is not racist\nhe is not homophobic\nhe only just hungry n homeless\nhe is an illegal alien but don let the mf trump know\n\nfuck ya'll niggas hatin' on a poor and homeless clown man, racist ass mfs, u should be ashamed of yaseolf"	
9147,"GUYS IM TELLING YOU THAT IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE NEW MOVIE YOU HAVE TO I HATE CLOWNS BUT THE MOVIE WAS AWESOME IT WAS BETTER THEN DEADPOOL AND SPIDER MAN HOMECOMING AND THOSE MOVIES WERE AWESOME BUT DEADPOOL TWO MIGHT BE BETTER 🤡"	
9148,"Why no comparison to the new movie?"	
9149,"I never understood the book when they just all gang banged her out of nowhere...then blood brothers? Pretty sure she  just wants to spread HIV+. Child pornography writing at its finest...gj Stephen."

9151,"Do a diy IT costume!!"	
9152,"My friends and I ran a train on a girl too, the only difference one of us got her pregnant 🤔"	
9153,"I'm pretty sure Pennywise is the Crimson King, or have I got that wrong?"	
9154,"I don't get King's idea of having a orgy be some way to make the group come together. If anything, it just means she is the one that keeps their love bind together. So if she dies, there's no bind that keeps them together."	
9155,"One of the hugest elements of the novel that was left out of the mini-series was the creepy abandoned house on the dead end street where the kids encounter maybe the most over the top psychological and metaphysical horror of the whole novel. This segment of the book is totally left out that's too bad because I've always considered it maybe the creepiest portion of the novel. In conclusion, the novel is simply so massive in its scope and unrelenting horror nastiness that it will never be successfully adapted to film."	
9156,"if you folks doing film blade runner and the novel 1968 do androids dream of electric sheep next use the 2009-2011 comic book by boom studios it's based on the novel it contains the full complete text of the novel illustrated by tony parker."

I even figured they may have taken her one after the other. NO idea how I correctly guessed that. Trophy of Awesome goes to me."	
9164,"wtf stephen king is a closet pedo like wow \n\nwhat a fucking weirdo \n\nI just turned into a Trump voter"	
9165,"The original one is not even the slightest bit scary."	
9166,"Do a diy costume for 2017 it"	
9167,"I have to commend you for not throwing a fit that the miniseries couldn't include everything in the book. You are right when you say its basically a faithful adaptation, and stuff was cut either for time, a broader audience, or creative decisions. People today expect an adaptation to CLING to the source material which shouldn't be the norm. Great video."	
9168,"Actually you guys are wrong. A girl did get murdered and grown up Mike Hanlon did found a picture of Georgie near the crime scene. The picture has been missing since Bill and Richie went back to check Georgie's moving and winking picture. Finding this photo is in fact the deciding factor for Mike to believe that IT did returned and called up the others. This is quite important in the book and the picture had driven a lot of flash back so I don't know how you could have missed it if you did read the book."

9190,"Big misconception that the miniseries also takes place in 1958. As with the current film it was moved forward a bit, though not as drastically. Book is 1958 - 1985 and the miniseries is 1960 - 1990."	
9191,"I'm black and I think this is episode is so unnecessary. This rarely happens in real life.

It seems that black people can't ever be portrayed as anything other than victims of racism, and it causes people to see blacks as nothing but victims, which isn't a good thing. It's degrading."

9204,"I think they should've done it in a few scenarios. \nEven though it's not as often there are black moms who adopt white children, and that'd be a good way to see how people react.\nSometimes ppl think she's the nanny. \n\nThough I think this was a good idea cause some people are so ignorant to interracial adoption.  When the race shouldn't matter at all."

9214,"This is really sad. i am adopted from Ecuador and my parents are Caucasian. I came here in 1997 and many people had things to say or gave my parents disgusted looks when they would go out in public with me. Even to this day if I go out to lunch with my father, people give us weird looks. It's disgusting."

9233,"The I don't like the I don't see colour line. It's cringe."	
9234,"I think most of the onlookers are racist!"	
9235,"They should've had the antagonist in the skit be black because of any white person tried to call her out she could use the you're white, you don't get it defense."	
9236,"I'd take a shit on there plate"

9252,"Ohhhhh, flip the roles, African American Mom, Caucasian child"	
9253,"These are some of the best responses I've seen yet from bystanders on this show.  Sometimes people get way too angry too easily instead of keeping calm or cool	 sometimes really lame-o arguments are used.  None of that here.  People only got mad when they'd been pushed to their limit.  All the advice they gave was stellar.  I loved and wanted to thank ALL of the bystanders here.  From the grandpas to the teenagers."

9698,"Very good footage, especialy for me, that loves Cetaceans. They are just M A J E S T I C .I cant even have a favorite species.. \nAll cetaceans are cool on their own way: \n\nOrcas are Huge predators but wont prey on humans for some reason.\nBowheads can live up to 200 years and they live on cold polar waters.\nBlue Whales are the biggest animal that ever lived and its vocalization is deafening.\nSperm whales can dive very deep to search for food, sleep verticaly and use sonar to see when there is no light.\nHumpbacks jump over the water, dance with its mate and have the most beautiful vocalization, almost like singing.\nThe List Goes On...\n\nCetaceans are something special."	
9699,"Where are Paul Watson and the Sea Shepard when you need them?"

9718,"I'm more concerned on how cold the water is"	
9719,"Killer Whale is a perversion of Whale Killer"	
9720,"Orcas have big jaws with large teeth yet they don't initiate their attack with bites, i guess that's because they don't have claws to grab their prey or pin them down like big cats.  Water is just air, and ocean mammals are quite slippery too, or maybe orcas are gentlemen and ladies, they don't want to dine like thugs like hyenas lol."	
9721,"The wolfs of the sea🤘🏼"	
9722,"Oh Minke, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Minke!"	
9723,"It's amazing. Killer Whales are truly the apex predators of the sea, because they have no natural predators (not including humans). They are so intelligent, and are even more intelligent than our own dogs and even some apes. \n\nSad that we have to imprison them in asylums for our entertainment."	
9724,"The way orcas hunt is scary but  it's an incredible footage. Circle of life.😑"

9742,"This is how nature balance its self"	
9743,"Strange, the killers never intended to eat the minke."	
9744,"baby minke + easy to  kill - orcas like us are lazy :) -- adults too much work"	
9745,"But whale hunting is illegal!  Someone should arrest these orcas and turn them into vegans."	
9746,"I reall hope there will be 4k content in this channel."

9750,"Green Peace shall protest against this cruelty. Down with the killer whales and sea gulls!"	
9751,"Why did the BBC not intervene? Humans should provide food for all wildlife to prevent this from happening"	
9752,"People have no empathy for animals. They're all caught up in their narrative."

I'm Canadian and actually living in Glasgow at the moment with my Scottish hubby 😊. So love you even more that you're Scottish! 😉👌🏻Have fun wedding dress shopping!!! X\nI'm definitely going to Harvey Nic's tomorrow in Edinburgh so spend all my money on Fenty haha"	
10246,"Ok. So i hadnt heard anything at all about this collection and Im not particularly a huge fan of Rihanna.  But OMG! you look gorgeous. When i saw the thumbnail i clicked on it immediately because i had to know what was on your face. You look so breath taking. Also i think you look so glowy and it made me laugh that you said you werent used to being so matte. Lol but anyways you look amazing."	
10247,"Does anyone know if the foundation would be any good for dry skin??? The struggle is so real finding a foundation that works with my crusty ass face ( I have good skin care I just have dry skin :( )"	
10248,"Why does she look different in the thumbnail ¿ Not saying it in a bad way she's absolutely beautiful but I'm just curious 🤷🏻‍♀️💗"	
10249,"Jamie do you have a tutorial with makeup for humid weather?"	
10250,"can't stop looking at your dingly earring. The mixture of earrings and piercings you have with your hair looks so fucking good. I want a dingly earring"	
10251,"I think everything looks great on you!! I saw sooo many people gathered around the Fenty Beauty display at Sephora today so I havent gotten a chance to browse it yet. You've got me excited to try it!!! You look beautiful❤❤"	
10252,"This is the best I have ever seen your skin! It looks so beautiful!"	
10253,"I think this is a nice brand and the foundation is great for people who like/prefer matte finish. You just rock the dewy look, Jamie!! Im the same way! I love my oils, my natural/satin/dewy finishes and i have been loving Cover Fx illuminating setting mist😍 you should try it. Love the highlighter, i bought trophy wife today. Gonna use it as eyeshadow. Thanks for this review!"	
10254,"I REALLY love this look on you!"	
10255,"JAAAMIIIEEE you look STUNNING! The lipgloss is gorgeous on you! Also your skin is amazing right now."	
10256,"New subscriber - love how this looks on your skin.  It looks dewy and flawless even though it sounds like it feels otherwise.  I've watched a couple of other reviews of the products and that's how I found you.  That seems to be a commonality.  What it feels like vs what it looks like are two different things though the matte feeling wasn't described as bad.  It sounds great for oily or combo skin but mine is super dry so I'm thinking there is no way it will work on me."	
10257,"How did I miss this 😍😍😍"	
10258,"Your skin...holy shit 😍😫 it is as plump and clear as an angels bum!!"	
10259,"Okay I may have to splurge on this line..maybe after my baby gets here because I'm just not feeling myself right now, despite all the makeup I have 😕 But this look looks great on you!! No creasing, nothing! Can't wait to see how it's worn! ❤❤"	
10260,"One of the best face looks you've done in my opinion 🙌🏽🙌🏽 you always look beautiful but the blends are so nice and natural! Enough bronzer blush everything so pretty! 😚😚😚💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽"	
10261,"This is honestly the best your skin has ever looked! It always looks good, but looks amazing here! Love the lip look way better than a liquid lip - looks like your natural lips but better. Also the gold higlighter looks crazy wearable and gorgeous."	
10262,"why have I never found you before now 😩 so genuine and unreal!!!"	
10263,"Skin looks gorgeous i think! Loved this review"	
10264,"Jamie💛💖💛,\n\nI absolutely LOVE this makeup on your skin!! You do not look too matte and to me anyways , you look fresh faced and a little dewey😗\n\nI bought the sticks from Sephora. They are coming today and I am super exfit3d to try them!!💖💖. Brianna is my woman crush so it's a bonus that I get to support $$ her and also support my own love of makeup at the same time!! Lol"	
10265,"I bought my shade online and it's about 70 shades too light. Lesson learnt: listen to Jamie and don't buy online 😂"	
10266,"See with the contour sticks do they have warmer ones? I use the smashbox ones still (throwback!) and I use a more cool toned one to contour, then I highlight (then I would cream blush if I used it), but then I blend my warmer shade where I would normally bronze and blend it a little further down or upward on my cheekbones and it acts as a bronzer rather than a contour stick. Don't know if you'll even see this but just thought it would help if you did want to utilise one as a cream bronzer."	
10267,"Anyone sick of eyeshadow and eyeshadow looks? I sure am, glad Rihanna didn't make that her release's focus"	
10268,"I'm a huge fan of your make-up looks, but this one is the best I've ever seen on you. Your skin is flawless and the lipgloss looks stunning on you and suits you a million times more than anything I've ever seen you wear on your lips. You should def' wear the foundation n highlighters again and the lipgloss is the biggest keeper xoxo"	
10269,"Your make up looks stunning here! You look beautiful, love your hair like this too xx"	
10270,"I love this !!!!!! I'm not a big fan of gold highlight because I feel it makes me look yellow toned or sort of washed out ? But this is amazing ' 🙌🏼"	
10271,"I love that the foundation is matte! Hopefully someone in New Zealand will stock it 🤞🏼I'm very keen to try. Thanks Jamie, love your videos as always x"	
10272,"I'm not a matte foundation fan for my skin either but your skin is looking really gorgeous so it's inspiring me to try it out! And I am really liking how natural it's looking. That yellow highlighter may be too much for my pale ass skin but it's surprisingly wearing really nice on you! Thanks for sharing!"	
10273,"I LOVE YOUR HAIR LIKE THIS GIRL!! <3 <3 ALSOO your skin is super nice!!  I thought your lashes were lash extensions you apply them so flippin well!! <3 #snapfam"

10300,"I think this makeup looks SO STUNNING on you!! sooo natural, looks nice for every day sorta thing since I know you like more full glam normally.. I think your skin looks super dewy and fresh and healthy, I'm digging this! <3"	
10301,"What color foundation did you use? Sorry if I missed it😬😣"	
10302,"this look is so good for you, you look so healthy and chic"	
10303,"I reckon you should give it a go without the MAC bronzer next time, the whole look would/will look amazing! The cream contour with highlighter on top -  YASSSSS.  \nX"	
10304,"Jamie!! why are you so perfect! Glowy is everything, BUT Matte looks good on you too!"

10320,"Yeah right, why was Shearer in this discussion? I think we already knew the outcome and I agree with Henry Shearer duo.\nBut it's kinda funny to see him here. lol."	
10321,"Where is Silva??? A true magician with the ball, the most underrated player in the Premier, he is simply superb week in week out."	
10322,"How can we not have Scholes!!"	
10323,"I would have to separate Gerrard and Lampand. Take Lampand out and put in Scholes or Virera. I would put Scholes in."	
10324,"Could you do a what would happen if the internet went down for an hour video?"

10558,"People here act like Valentina won,i was rooting for Valentina but JEEESUS,if you want the belt you have to FIGHT,she threw 50 punches in the whole match,2 of them landed to no effect,no pressure,just waiting....If Amanda would have played the counter game Valentina would have literally thrown NO PUNCHES....Im dissapointed in Valentina after all that shit talkin' and shit i would have expected to actually fight for it...and now she acts like she was robbed....This kind of fights really expose fighters like Valentina who just wait for a mistake....i understand the counter strike game trust me but man.....she literally did NOTHING in this fight"	
10559,"Where's Dana so he can say he has it 2-2 going into the 5th round ?"	
10560,"Yeah that Hobbie Lawler fight is the one to make. His hlord hesus Christ and saviour wants that fight."	
10561,"Valentina #1.   FUCKKKK YOUUUU BİTCHHHHHHH AMENDA NUNES"	
10562,"First Cejudo fight and pressor I've seen. New found respect for his skills and his respectful attitude. Looked a lot like Conor's wide karate in / out bouncing style stance and extended arm - pawing at his opponent. Not a McGregor fan by any stretch of the imagination, just an observation."	
10563,"Gustafsson admitted that he didn't do enough to take the belt from Bonesjones, even though he thinks he won the fight on points. Valentina needs to take the obvious hint, don't leave it up to the judges. To be the champ not only do you have to beat the champ, you have to rip the champs head off!"	
10564,"I watched the fight back in silence with a pen and scorecard. I gave Nunes rounds 1,3 and 5 under the current point scoring system. Amanda won, but the whole system is wrong and limited	 needs a radical overhaul."
10565,"Nunes keep calling herself Lioness (female lion) but she keeps using Lion (male) image"

10567,"Robbed or not..dont leave it in the hands of the judges.."	
10568,"I wont lie nunes got the win but if it was five rounds she would have hassed and and been wrecked"	
10569,"I love how ppl are saying Valentina won, you dummies nobody won, they gave it to Nunes based on simple technicality, she just moved more at the end but both fighters didn't do shit the whole time I was actually thinking my online feed was buffering or something at one point cuz they were just like standing still, imo, they both lost, I would have sent a message to both fighters and other fighters in UFC and gave a decision of No Contest, both losers, you don't train for months and have all these people pay to get in and pay to watch it on TV and than after all the build up just look at each other and bounce around touching each other's gloves the odd time for 15 mins, fuck this fight, UFC needs to change is rules, in a case like this with no clear winner, have 3 fuckin bonus rounds, if still nothing, 3 more, eventually someone will lose clearly."	
10570,"A MAN NUNES , what a gutless monstrosity...Dudes like that, shouldn't be around! The UFC should force him to fight CYBORG with Herb To the death Dean reffing that shit!!!!"	
10571,"UFC What are the fight bonus ?????????????????????????????????????"

10574,"Nunes vs shevchenko\n\nThe battle of grammar"	
10575,"Shevchenko needs to be humble in loss you fought her before you knew what you had to do counter punch don't cut it it was close but I think judges was right"	
10576,"Amanda is a good person"	
10577,"Lets agree here amanda was afraid to lose the belt n therefore fought the way she did n valentina the same onli cuz she was afraid of losing the oppurtunity. Alot of these champions r fightimg too safe they need to go bak to wat got them there in the first place"	
10578,"when do we get the drug test results"	
10579,"you can't win the belt if you avoid fighting"	
10580,"lol Nunes can either go 2 rounds and blast people then gas out or go 5 rounds and do nothing."	
10581,"nunez said she didn't want tte ko or sub  she wanted to show she could go 5 rds 25 mins  BULLSHIT who wouldn't ko an opponent  if possible she sounds stupid"	
10582,"Bought women fought bad as fuck. Don't be bitching about judges now, you both lost."	
10583,"Only i couldn't listen that stupid monkey nunes? Her face looks like my shit"	
10584,"Nunes lost this fight 100% Valentina should be champion!"	
10585,"Idk. I had it a draw but then Nunes got that take down at the end. Lets do it again! Trilogy!"	
10586,"why do people hate amanda so much? did she kick a kitten or something?"	
10587,"The commentary was fucking gold during this event."	
10588,"Valentina didn't win, nor did Nunes. It was a DRAW and there needs to be a 3rd fight. Neither fighter did enough to win or even win a round decisively. Nunes' take down was nothing, it wasnt clean and she did no damage with it. It's a major floor of mma that take downs are given props like this. If you try a take down and can't land it clean or do any damage with it, that should go against you in the judging if anything!"	
10589,"Nunes needs to go up in weight and get a shot at Conor's belt, he deserves it👍"

10612,"Feeling happy for Henry Cejudo, good stuff!"	
10613,"Dude.....I cant remember ever watching a 125 lber post fight, but i'm liking Cejudo more and more. His style is entertaining af, he should technically be 2-0 since losing to DJ, and fighting for the title next against the plague."	
10614,"Also i am sure polish jenchenchik would get fucked by shevchenko"	
10615,"Actually believe it or not Nunes won the fight, the punchings exchanges were positive for her the 2 first rounds. Valentina got more overall. Nunes' plan was to weaken that right leg from Valentina for the 4 rounds and then secure the win with a takedown in the last one. The standing fight was really close tho, valentina shown more combinations and techniques but most of them were not significatnt/strong ones. If Nunes didnt performed the takedown on the last round she would have lost. The last round was very positive in the standing game for Shevchenko.\n\nNunes clearly managed the octagon and distance for the entire fight, and thats a fact. Valentina knew Nunes was abusing her leg with low kicks and did practically nothing about it."	
10616,"shut up nunes you lost"	
10617,"I think a reasonable person could see how either fighter could have been given the decision.   Valentina herself only thinks she won 3 rounds, so if the judges disagreed with her on only one round then she lost.  My assessment is that Amanda clearly won rounds 1 and 5, while Valentina won round 4, so the debate is who won rounds 2 and 3.  Valentina, I thought was too defensive and although she has quicker hands, she was only waiting to counter, problem is Amanda knew it, so Amanda was the aggressor but she was using low kicks and kicks to the abdomen, making it difficult for Valentina to counter and limited her scoring opportunities.  Because Amanda was the aggressor and the judges are suppose to award the aggressor, since they are bringing the fight, that's was the key reason Amanda won.  You can play it safe like Valentina, be defensive and only plan to score by countering the whole night, but don't be surprise when you lose, since the only fighter I've seen to have success with that strategy in title fights is Mayweather, but unfortunately Valentina is not Mayweather.  Lastly, I suspect Valentina was gun shy after feeling Amanda power in the first fight, since that's the only reason I can think of that would cause her not to let her hands go, when her hands are clearly quicker that Amanda's."	
10618,"Valentina beat herself with a stupid fight plan.  She used the same passive fight plan she used on holly but this just in, Amanda saw that fight.  Valentina didn't want to take risk so all Amanda had to do was be the aggressor in each round knowing since close rounds go to the aggressor.  Amanda plan was to simply out point valentina unlike her other fights were she goes for the ko, thats why she was smiling in between rounds because she knew she was winning.  She won the fights with those leg kicks, kicks to the abdomen and those take downs in round 5, while valentina was sitting there waiting to counter, something she didn't get to do much"	
10619,"Valentina didn't do shit this fight, get over it, she deserved the L"	
10620,"Round 1 Nunes\nRound 2 Valentina\nRound 3 Nunes\nRound 4 Valentina\nRound 5 Nunes\nWatch it again. I'm not a Nunes fan but that fucking bitch won fair. Valentina did more damage, Nunes scored more points."

10624,"For all you Valentine fans stop crying. This was a boring fight!!! Shavchenko fought like a little girl. To be a champion you have to beat the champion. Not by points but the head off. Nunes is the champ. She stood her ground."	
10625,"sorry but Nunes really not convince me in this fight she do nothing  and everything she say in the post fight dont make sense Oo , in my book Valentina win the fight  but is look she dont make enough to win the belt"	
10626,"Valentina was frightened, she did not do the necessary to be champion, she talked too much and did nothing, robbery would be to get a champ doing nothing"	
10627,"why hate on nunes, she had a job to do and did it, the UFC fucked up not her"	
10628,"melendez needs to retire or something... he doesn't care for fighting anymore it seems... if you're a strikeforce fan... this isn't the same melendez at all."	
10629,"Look at shevchenkos head looks like she stuck it in a beehive !She says Amanda didn't hurt her but did she ever really hurt Amanda?Amanda kinda Floyd mayweathered Valentina and then took her down to seal the deal no robbery close fight but no robbery"	
10630,"Shevchenko is robbed"	
10631,"Valentina won that fight!"	
10632,"That was some bullshit for real that the crooked judges gave Amanda Nunes the win over Valentina Shevchenko! They did her dirty right there. I finished watching the fight just now. Valentina clearly won that fight and should be the next champion. Valentina gave the most connected striking in each round than Amanda did towards Valentina. Valentina stopped one of Amanda's takedowns, successfully gotten out of one of her traps on the ground in the last round, with exception for the last takedown which Amanda didn't hardly do anything when she was on top of her. No submission or ground pounding from Amanda...while Valentina on her back was striking her really well. I don't blame her for being angry about the decision and filing a appeal for a third fight. For over a year now, these judges would make decisions over fights screwing these fighters of their win when it was obvious they scored the fight in each round incorrectly and unfairly. I don't what drugs these judges were on or what they got against Valentina, but they are wrong for making that decision. Sorry. They need to hire new judges who are experienced in judging these fights. That's just how I feel. 😠 It's time for a *Trilogy* ☺"

10636,"Rematch!"	
10637,"Nunes won at best 2 rounds... Robbed simply based on the fact Nunes did get a takedown but did ZERO damage with it and actually received damage from getting hit from the bottom. Nunes was gifted this decision for sure."	
10638,"Saltchenko fans make me so happy. Ya girl lost. Cry some more."	
10639,"47-47 if you include the point which should have been deducted"	
10640,"I though that Shevchenko won the fight, I gave Nunes the 1st round then Shevchenko the 2nd, 3rd and 4th round and then Nunes the 5th, I like both fighters but seriously when Shevchenko lost it didn't really bother me as I like both fighters but I lost a serious amount of respect to Shevchenko because all she did was bitched at the end of the fight, other fighters are humble in defeat and she didn't even thank the the crowd, thank Nunes and said it was a really tough fight, all she did was bitched and said the judges are terrible and I won easily. Although I thought Shevchenko won, I lost a lot of respect to her"	
10641,"Bout scores:\n\nJohnson x Martins (8/10)\nHenrique x Bhullar (2/10)\n\nClarke x White (8/10)\nTucker x Glenn (4/10)\nMoras x Evans (5/10)\nMcMann x Vieira (5/10)\n\nStephens x Melendez (5/10)\nLatifi x Pedro (2/10)\nCejudo x Reis (8/10)\nMagny x Anjos (6/10)\nNunes x Shevshen (2/10)"	
10642,"Valentina didn't show the fight of champion. Its not enough!"	
10643,"Nunes was 1-0 up in terms of their rivalry.she had less to lose. Even if nunes lost, it would have been a draw so she really just had to control the fight & avoid major damage.Valentina lost her chance. E.g Conor vs Nate... conor came back and won making it a draw."	
10644,"How Valentina lost this fight I'll never know...she out struck Nunes....like Dana White always said never leave it in the judges hands."	
10645,"I don't hate Amanda for this it's the judges fault absolutely disgusting obviously picking nunes because she black & a lesbian it's this generations wet dream me & shevchenko would gun all you antifa black lives matter down with explosive rounds then me & shevchenko will fornicate for hours on end"	
10646,"Valentina lost you idiots because to take a title away from a champion you have to put on a convincing performance.  If you don't then the champion always get the benefit of the doubt in situations like these.  If she actually went for it and fought instead of engaging in a sparring session the whole fight then it would be a different story."	
10647,"Valentina, never leave it in the hands of the judges. To win a title fight you need to knock out or submit your opponent. You did not do that so stop whining!!!!"	
10648,"Greatest fighter is only Valentina...love u"

10670,"Bono singing Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me with a knowing smile. Nice one U2."	
10671,"It´s funny to see here some comments. The song is tuned Half Step Down, like many other U2 songs, like many other songs of great rock bands ie Guns &Roses. That doesn´t mean Bono can´t reach high notes, this is meaning that for the first time and since they are touring is better to preserve his voice. On the other hand Bono has a little craspy voice here, since he is suffering a lot with air conditioning so anytime he flyes has the same little problem... he also has some allergy in dry cities or cities near the dessert (like California). Again that doesn´t mean he´s not able to sing because being older, but because is human. And finally I think this is a great U2 pop song, typical heavy riff based on chord progressions and Edge signature delay... as much as I hear this song the more I like it!"	
10672,"every u2 songs alway better  in live version than recording version version.. always.."	
10673,"What a beautiful pop song. Shows once again why U2 are the modern day Beatles."	
10674,"This version sounds so good. Liked it when the whole audience stood up for the legends."	
10675,"Really like the simplicity."	
10676,"I'll definitely buy this album! U2 is the best!"	
10677,"REALLY hated this song the first time I heard it. It takes repeated listens to appreciate it...kind of like all of their music from the last 20 years."	
10678,"This song concerned me at first but it's really growing on me especially performed down a half step"	
10679,"Brilliant from the lads"

10693,"Sounds like a bunch of drowning cats!!!"

10695,"our U2 will be never unplugged of life a great group"	
10696,"Still sounding as great as ever"	
10697,"The only interesting part of the song is the bridge"	
10698,"like  the simplicity of the chorus..classic  Bono"	
10699,"I'm no U2 hater or something, but this is a really mediocre performance of a really mediocre song."	
10700,"They need to work with a producer who will push them/quality control them - this is not going in the time capsule."	
10701,"tooo poppy shit"	
10702,"That opening chord reminds me of the opening chord to 'it's a Hard Days Night' by the Beatles"	
10703,"The musicianship is undeniable but the song doesn't have any punch."	
10704,"not sure if Larry could look less enthusiastic haha. i think he's had enough."	
10705,"The Edge sings like an Angel"	
10706,"total tripe the bass player says it all with his facial expressions totally boring"	
10707,"Certainly not their best. Extremely catchy but too repetitive and bland. Lacks depth and ideas. Very weak. Blackout much better. Hopefully SOE makes up for this. Still love U2 though. Croke park was the best."	
10708,"At 1:34 when the verse riff suddenly kicks back quickly off the chorus..that's the best thing"	
10709,"This won't even make the top 100"

10713,"Was driving my car when heard a song and thought this is U2... now I've broken the reply button."	
10714,"I like the song, but they should add a lot more power to bass and drums when they play it live. The DJ version had the crowd going the first time they heard it."	
10715,"3:14 Edge outbonoing Bono"	
10716,"In this times we need the real and transgressor U2 not this"

10718,"Their voices are out of this world but I can call them Queen #2"	
10719,"Jimmy at the end says call your DJ? WTF!"	
10720,"The left guitarist wasn't playing what the sound was most of the time"	
10721,"So, I'm a huge U2 fan. I've loved basically everything they've ever done. However, I  think that the arrangement is ruining the song. There is a video of KYGO performing a remix of this from last year - the song is the same, the lyrics are a bit different. It's 1000 betters, in my opinion. - To me, this arrangement seems very unfocused, very off..and this performance was even more so."	
10722,"it looks that if you don't like it.. you are not suppose.. to think.. or say why... mm.. sorry u2.. your good days are over.. u2 should retire."

10758,"dogshit"	
10759,"This band has released nothing beyond banal pop music since The Unforgettable Fire <-- last U2 album I bought. Saddens me to see such influential indie ppl go so horribly wrong. Joshua Tree was cold and calculated and determined. Prior to JT, all was slightly wild and whimsical and clangingly political	 meant to waken the heart and stir the spirit.  These guys should have retired in 1985...when college radio and underground still meant something..."
10760,"I will say it rock and roll is dead terrible"

10763,"just dull...."	
10764,"The last 2 albums have been absolutely shocking!!! This sounds worse!"	
10765,"Did anone else hear Bono burp at 1:28?"	
10766,"U2 ,,christ all there songs sound the same .. boring.\nHow they ever got this far just proves people's taste in music is shit."	
10767,"LOL This songs sucks! All that garbage that they cancelled the new album release because of trump is obviously a lie to deflect the fact the new album stinks and the last album stinks! They don	t even play songs from the last album on the tour because\nthere was not a single hit sing on the album worth playing to satisfy the fans\n\nthis song is boring complete garbage and this is what they release as the single!! The rest of the album must be even worse\n\nAnother U2 album I will not be buying"
10768,"The scary thing is that this song is another pile of shit from u2 and still people laud it.....u2 are finished"	
10769,"They need to stick to playing their old and irrelevant rehashed music, nothing worse than 60+ y/o rich as fuck soft rock musicians who are not even American talking shit about American politics. Remember guys in rock bands back in high school? Are these the guys that you really want to hear spouting political opinions? These were the guys that were usually too stoned to stay awake during civics class."

10856,"Is it purpose or coincidence? The blood pattern on the walls match their letters. example U's blood pattern made an italicized u mark pattern. letter O's blood pattern almost formed a complete circle blood pattern. I's scattered blood pattern is slanted but resembles an letter I. E's blood pattern on the right side is a slanted E. and A's blood pattern on the right side, the upper is a triangle, and below it is 2 legs, which combined forms an A. Can anyone relate?"

10908,"i bet newt is hagrid's father"	
10909,"I always wondered\nWhat was hagrid's house when he was a student"	
10910,"YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR INTRO"	
10911,"Caffeine. His shirt is the molecular structure of caffeine."	
10912,"Answer. He got another wand....... Harry's wand broke. He just used another wand. I'm sure Dumbledore was able to pull some strings and get him and somewhat ok wand."	
10913,"Try connect all HP theories in one vid. Do they line up? I have no idea 😂"	
10914,"Wait wasn't Hagrid in his third year when he was expelled? Shouldn't that have made him 13, not 15? Or did he start school at a later age?"	
10915,"personally i like the thought that Hagrid is just accidentally amazing at wandless magic.\n\nMagic is all about intent. Because Hagrid THINKS he wand still works, it does.\n\nBit silly yeah but i find it amusing"	
10916,"why was hagrids wand snapped in the first place? newt was expelled for basically the same reason, and his wand is fine."	
10917,"So I haven't read the books and I was wondering, can magic users do magic without wands?"	
10918,"What I always wondered	 what did Lilly see in Severus?"
10919,"Newt should have been Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts ❤"	
10920,"This is an amazing theory and I really hope you're right. I would love to see Hagrid under Newt's tutelage. It would create a perfect connection to everything."	
10921,"Yea, right... But damn, I need that Slotherin pillow so bad!!"	
10922,"The books tell you what happened this isn't necessary"	
10923,"I literally didn't even notice the umbrella was pink..."	
10924,"Ben, caffeine belongs in your coffee not on your shirt. Lol"	
10925,"Hey! Did you guys know that sir Cadogan (or whatever) CAN actually be spotted in the prisoners of azkaban(movie) when the fat lady portrait is broken. You guys should make a video about it!"	
10926,"My question is why do they even have umbrellas in the wizarding world in the first place. In fantastic beasts we see them use a spell to produce an ubrella and fantastic beasts is a PREquel. So the fact that his umbrella does nothing and that his umbrella can produce an umbrella baffles me."	
10927,"💥💥💥 *mind blown*💥💥💥\nYou have No idea how happy watching this video made me. It filled in so many blanks n got me super pumped for Fantastic beasts!!! 😄😄😄\nUr awesome!"	
10928,"Please tell me the truth about OLAF in FROZEN"	
10929,"How is Hagrid fifteen when he is in his third year? 3:54"	
10930,"Why do we never see any magical patronus animals throughout the series? We see a phoenix from Dumbledore, but how come no students or teachers have magical creature patroni?"	
10931,"This is a great theory and I definitely hope we will get to see the duel in the movies, hopefully in the last one, but you have made one mistake, or rather not explained an apearent mistake by the books. If Grindelwald was not the master of the elder wand because he was defeated before his duel with Dumbledore, how come Dumbledore became the master of the elder wand after he beat Grindelwald. I wouldn´t even mind this plothole so much, except it is almost the same idea THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS RESULTED BY!"	
10932,"You just really destroyed my fantastic beasts experience...as if this theory is happens to be true..then I have already got the spoilers😔😔"	
10933,"Before I watch the video... Dumbledore is the owner of the elder wand. Having suspicions about tom riddle...dumbledore simply repairs the wand for Hagrid and continues to teach him magic in spare time over the years (we all know Dumbledore doesn't really value the ministry of magic's laws)...he could have easily aided Hagrid in concealing his wand and repairing it."	
10934,"If anything remotely close to this makes it's way into the fantastic beasts franchise, you should get paid."	
10935,"Cool theory, but unfortunately you don't know transfiguration. First of all, no matter how good the transfigurator is, the transfigured object can't stay in the new form forever, sooner or later it'll change back. Second of all, magic objects are non-transfigurable."	
10936,"Am I the only one who says duel like dew-e-l not dool"	
10937,"This is a great theory!!!!"	
10938,"thats truly a great and exciting theory !!!"	
10939,"I got a cherry wood wand, 14 and a half inches, phoenix core. I'm quite happy with it. =)"	
10940,"Assuming that it is Rex, can you do a video about how he ended up in Wall-E's collection? It could make quite the sad story."	
10941,"Have you ever thought that your theories are correct until you post a video out the theory? Exec producer: Well we can't use that idea any more because someone just figured it out."	
10942,"can you please please please do a video about how tom riddle wasn't an obscurial!!!!!!!"	
10943,"I was wondering do you reckon a basilisk would make an appearance in fantastic beasts and where to find them"	
10944,"I want this to be true so bad"	
10945,"Also a friend of mine ask me this how is cars born  after watching cars3"	
10946,"I used to really like these videos and then realised then I that you just use the material right off pottermore...."	
10947,"I love this theory!!!"	
10948,"You make it too difficult... Dumbledore knows due to legilimency that Hagrid didn't release the basalisk.  He knows Hagrid is being blamed for something he didn't do but can't change people's minds due to anti-giant bias.  So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states... He says that he still has the pieces to which Ollivander says he hopes he doesn't use them, to which Hagrid fumbles at the umbrella."	
10949,"I remember the yellow ball with the star on it, I remember seeing it in a show I used to watch. I just can't pinpoint which episode it is. Which show is it from?"	
10950,"To SCB's defense, i saw Seamus' video 2 weeks ago and the theories are not exactly the same. I think it's a coincidence that they made videos about similar topics and I seriously doubt they would watch Seamus' video and purposely take the idea. Seamus talked more about how Dumbledore might have mentored Hagrid and SCB talked more about his wand and how it would've been fixed and predicting his role in the next Fantastic Beasts movie. Y'all are getting upset over something that's not a huge issue. I hope they come out and say something."	
10951,"Maybe Newt is a relative of Hagrid somehow?"	
10952,"the real question is who should play Hagrid\npersonally i say The Mountain from Game of Thrones"	
10953,"Do you hear that? I think it's the sound of all of your viewers minds simultaneously\nexploding!"	
10954,"Hey Brother ! I need to presentate myself for my class. I'm a nerd and I think the most of us here (what is awesome). I was searching on YouTube, but I couldn't find a really good clip of it. So I thought that you could explain in a clip how awesome and cool it is to be a nerd.thumbs if you want to see this happen.And please comment on this."	
10955,"Ok. Ready. Harry didn't get the elder wand from Draco. But he got it in the cave from the half blood prince. When Harry makes dumbledore drink the potion that makes him relive his worst memory. He drop his wand"	
10956,"in case you didn't know there is a place in Switzerland called Grindelwald. just if you wanted that, then your welcome. however if you already knew it then... just checking."	
10957,"When I was young I thought Hagrid was weird for hanging out with little kids but now that I'm older he has become my favorite character. I wish he was my friend lol"	
10958,"i wish the cc did not fill the whole screen."	
10959,"Love this theory guys, I hope the theory appears to be true in the upcoming FB movies."	
10960,"As much as I like Hagrid, and as horrible as it was that Hagrid got blamed for Myrtle Warren's death, I agree with his expulsion because he did have a dangerous monster in the castle, even if it wasn't the one causing the attacks. Acromantulas eat humans, and having one in a school... yeah, Hagrid deserved to be expelled and should never have been a teacher."	
10961,"Hi Love this video 💖 I have an amazing idea for a new series that you should both watch Once Upon A Time which is on Netflix ❤️"	
10962,"Hagrid was 13/14 when expelled. Not 15. He was a third year. So unless he was held back..."	
10963,"Harry didn't win elder wand from voldemort... he won from draco malfoy"	
10964,"If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^"	
10965,"It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand."	
10966,"Loving the Woody and Buzz toys in the background by the way"	
10967,"I just thought that Dumbledore secretly fixed Hagrid's wand with the elder wand because he knew that Hagrid had nothing to do with the incidents."	
10968,"I just realized Quidditch teams could just go to the room of requirement and get a bunch of steroids and firebolts."	
10969,"If your names not j k Rowling hen your theory is bs! And her and warner bros sue any one who tries to monetise off of Harry Potter"	
10970,"What a cool theory I hope this is right"	
10971,"Fantastic theory! I really hope it's right"	
10972,"Are you guys Christians"	
10973,"omg this my first vid watching a vid of yours in 2017"	
10974,"I've thought Dumbledore repaired hayride wand for a long time"	
10975,"what house was Hagrid in?"	
10976,"3:58 Wasn't Hagrid expelled in his 3rd year? I'm pretty sure he stated in the first book that he was expelled in his third year."	
10977,"I would absolutely love to see a young Hagrid. And a scenario like this would be great. It would explain so much and add such depth to Hagrid's character."	
10978,"Harry did not win it from Voldemort. He won it from Draco Malfoy"	
10979,"That would make so much sense"	
10980,"Pausing at 42 seconds.\n\nDumbledore it's alwayse deus ex dumbledore.\n\nI so hope I right making this WAG."	
10981,"I came up with this theory like 2 years ago I mean you just had to connect the dots in the books."	
10982,"But if newt has already beaten grindlewald with his beasts could that mean newt is the master of the elder wand and neither Harry or dumbledore have ever been the masters"	
10983,"Could you do another zootopia video?"

11036,"The eye primer looks like it might work like the Wet & Wild one. Use a small amount and blend with your finger on ONLY the lid. If you take it any farther it gets gross and clumpy looking - like your skin is super dry and peeling. Also, set it with  a normal setting powder."

11070,"I suuuuuper love the makeup look. Love it even more without eyeliners 🔥🔥 Please also try the face primer along with a dewy finish foundation."	
11071,"That primer though right, so awesome, I thought it was going to be difficult blending the foundation because the primer was so sticky! I wonder if you try those shimmer/foils from the She palette with an eye primer that you are comfortable with if they work any better? Just a thought, also wonder if maybe the beauty bakery ones don't like playing with others? I really want the She palette but if those shimmer fail that bad not sure ill get it now, 😞"

11307,"I can't believe Beatrice's dad is played by Matthew Broderick. I totally didn't recognize him"	
11308,"This makes the scene where Bojack threw the doll out the window ten times more fucked up. Jesus Christ."	
11309,"when she was a child his father order to burn everything, why? she had  scarlet fever.\n\nagain, lets remmember, scarlet fever was the leading cause of death of children in the 50s and 60s, it was a virus that spread on to personal belongings, so they had to get rid of everything, im not defending bea's father, he was a misogynistic, racist, elitist piece of shit, but he was a result of his time.\n\ngranted, he should have explained why he was burning everything to his young girl, but he didnt, because he doesnt know to treat women feeling and he wont learn (s4e2).\n\nthe 50s were fucked up, it was too much man!"	
11310,"this episode deserves a fucking emmy"	
11311,"This series really needs more marketing. Fuck, the only thing i saw was a Netflix trailer a couple of weeks ago, then nothing. Rick and Morty has got a lot of marketing behind it (rightfully deserved, because i love it), but why not Bojack? There were some amazing episodes in this season"	
11312,"We've had Clorox since 1913. Joseph could've disinfected the doll instead of burning it. He went for the quickest, dirtiest, most traumatic solution possible.\n\nJust like he did with his wife."	
11313,"Essay question	  All this being discovered this season really changes the perspective on a lot of internal problems Bojack has. Should what Todd said in season 3 about all Bojack's problems being self created and has nothing to do with his past still be valid? Go."
11314,"what's the piano track that starts playing at 1:52 called?"	
11315,"So how does procreation work in this universe"

11318,"Abuse and trauma are cyclical. Your parents will pass them on to you. You may never know why, and your parents might not even realize it."	
11319,"I like how child Beatrice yelling NO MY BABY sounds just like when old Beatrice yells NO MY BABY in a previous episode."	
11320,"Did anyone notice the family portrait in the background?"	
11321,"This episode was amazing. Usually in the case of this person is evil but look how tragic their past was I struggle to get that invested anymore but fuuuuuuck, even though I've seen more tragic backstories the way this episode was done just broke my heart. Doesn't make Beatrice's actions justified but I think the way she treated the Hollyhock situation really cemented how damaged her way of thinking had become. Give these creators an Emmy god damn."	
11322,"thanks random youtuber for uploading the saddest thing ever. i needed to cry hysterically i'm sure anyway."	
11323,"Can't tell who's worse or more loath-able...\n\nButterscotch or Joseph?"	
11324,"Even though I wish they showed more side characters like Todd and character actress margo martindale!! The way they made Beatrice sympathetic is amazing. \nOne of the best and most fucked up scenes of the series, all the parallels between characters."	
11325,"Full teared on this one"	
11326,"sex with a horse would kill you. Giving birth to one will definitely kill you."	
11327,"If her father really was like that and this was the standard of fatherly behavior in the 50s, I am so glad I didn't grow up in that era. Anyone who's nostalgic for those days needs a reality check."	
11328,"Wait a second.. the star... on the foreheads beatrice her father and bojack have it, and so does the daughter does that mean bojacks father was not lying about his mother or is she really bojacks daughter and he slept with the help?"	
11329,"Remember when Hollyhock goes back to her family and Beatrice asks where the baby is?\n\nOh, that's right, I took the baby.\n\nShe took the baby from Henrietta."	
11330,"I love how in 0:29 and how they used people's faces all scratched up to show how bojack's mother is sick and can't always remember what people look like or had with them."	
11331,"It's painful that Beatrice's mom lost her mind because of the forced lobotomy. Beatrice then became a hateful person without love to avoid the same fate, only to have her mind slowly rot away to dementia anyways..."	
11332,"Getting darker(anybody get the reference)"	
11333,"that sound effect that plays when Beatrice's mother's silhouette appears in the flames is bone chilling"	
11334,"Am I the only one who thought this episode was as dark as Sarah Lynn last season? Easily the best episode aside from Episode 2."	
11335,"the beginning of the theme song with the transition of bojack turning into henrietta made my heart sink.. i knew this episode was going to be fucked up as hell after watching that. i can officially say three cartoon characters have brought me to tears now, pearl from steven universe, beatrice horseman and sarah lynn"	
11336,"Time and Time again, we've seen how this season has shown us that hurt people hurt people, even if that wasn't their intentions. Whether it's Bojack or Princess Carolyn, or even Henrietta.. But Bojack's grandfather.. is byfar the worst character on the show. I understand that there's no excuse for Bojack or Henrietta's actions throughout the show, but the grandfather doesn't have that luxury to fall back on. Since he's been introduced, he's been dismissive and absent when it comes to dealing with any hardships that weren't his own. Instead of supplying comfort for his wife when she was in need he abandoned her and later had her lobotomized when her life was spiraling out of control. I can make a list of issues this dude has but.. it's just too depressing to go on.. to his that all this hate and hurt originated from one man who was just.. sickening"	
11337,"This was possibly the happiest season yet, but that doesn't mean we didn't get some scary shit."	
11338,"I'm glad I'm emotionally strong enough not to cry, or sympathize with Beatrice for being a complete horses ass of a Queen Bitch. I do understand why she is that way, and all I can say is.....well, that's life sometimes."	
11339,"Your sickness has infected everything, it all must be destroyed"	
11340,"your sickness has infected everything.\ni like the funny show with the talking horsies"	
11341,"I love Henrietta,, would love to see her in season five. Want to see her and Hollyhock reunite and spend time together."	
11342,"If Hollyhock has that diamond birthmark, does that mean that Butterscotch wasn't lying to Beatrice when he told her that she reminded him of his dead mother?"	
11343,"One day, this will all be a pleasant memory...\n\nFuck. You."	
11344,"Henrietta is such a whore"

11346,"So long college degree. Rick and Morty and Bojack Horseman are my world now :/"	
11347,"I didn't know how to feel about this scene, fuck man, this was fucked up..."	
11348,"there is soo much thought put into this episode like i think its really telling that she only reognies Bojack when he is walking away from her i guess his back is a more common sight for her then atually seeing his frount."	
11349,"The only thing that bugs me is that hollyhawk has the diamond on her forehead.I mean her father doesn't have that diamond on his forehead thus bojack inherited that trait from his mother.But in the end is a show where a horse screws a human and she gives birth to a horse instead of a centaur."	
11350,"Is it bad that I was too sad at the burning because it was that she had contaminated items \nHer father is the character I could ponder forever, he screwed up major with his family but it's not like he didn't love them. I'm pretty sure he regretted his wife's lobotomy earlier in the episode"	
11351,"This is probably,one of the best episodes ive seen in a long as time\n\nThe last good show with a episode that fucking amazing was Breaking Bad: Fly"	
11352,"The scene with Beatrice and her father at the fire place was actually really scary."	
11353,"I'm not crying... someone put tears in my eyes :'C"	
11354,"This show is a masterpiece. Nothing more I say can do it justice."	
11355,"The lobotomy Honey Sugarman had, is a reference to Rosemary Kennedy, sister of JFK, who had a lobotomy and left her numb for the rest of her life. Hell, even Joseph Sugarman shares name of JFK dad, Joseph Kennedy."	
11356,"Christ I've been so busy I haven't been able to watch season 4\nSo I just tie myself over with YT clips\n\n\nI NEED MY DEPRESSED HORSE"

11359,"that's too much man"	
11360,"Bojack's grandpa was the devil"	
11361,"This is the best Bojack episode"	
11362,"this was like horror"	
11363,"We mess up our children and they mess up their children. That cycle has no end. Break the cycle. Be a better parent. If you can't, please, for the sake of the world, don't have children."	
11364,"next season we are going to get a sad backstory for sugarman."	
11365,"not to be dramatic but this episode made me cry"	
11366,"Time's Arrow literally went in reverse and stood still, something it shouldn't do."	
11367,"Never imagined Matthew Broderick playing a villain character before. Now i see it clearly."	
11368,"Has anyone else noticed that in every season, episode 11 is always the darkest/most fucked up episode?"	
11369,"You don't wanna end like your mother now, do you? \nholy fuck that scene is spooky"	
11370,"I am really very glad that they explored the theme of abuse in parenthood, especially in this fashion.\n\nJust as B's father tormented her under the guise of being a good father, she tormented BoJack under the guise of being a good mother.\n\nBut it was never about BoJack to her. It was never him being a bad child. It was about her taking out her frustrations and anxiety on others. It was about her making sure that everyone was just as miserable as her. And lo and behold BoJack took out those frustrations on people he cared about. Not because he thought any of it was right, but because it was normal to him to be this way.\n\nBecause remember: abuse doesn't have to be physical at all. Emotional abuse can be terrifying and ugly and nobody would even know it was until it was too late.\n\nAnd the both of them just couldn't admit it because why would they? You can't do a whole hell of a lot as a child against your parents.\n\nDoes this justify their actions? No, of course not. But it does paint a clearer picture as to why they are this way."	
11371,"the cycle of abuse is real as fuck"	
11372,"What's the song that was used in this song?"	
11373,"Scenes like this just remind me that few people are just born cruel. Most people that are cruel are broken over time."	
11374,"This episode was almost horrifying at some points"	
11375,"Just watched the fourth season.\n\nAnd i gotta say this episode eas really sad and strong. I ve never seen something like in that in television, the deep and realistic things. Sometimes we met a person, or live with one we may not like and we may not be aware of their past and why the person nowadays does what he does....\n\nAlso...\n\nThat scene when she get bullied for being kinda fat explains why she ended up intoxicating Hollyhock...\n\nThis is so real. And i think the writters really got heavy on the subject...\n\nLike, theres no aesthetics or glamourized story. They putted reality on it."	
11376,"bojack horseman explains the cycle of abuse so well... the parallel between joseph and beatrice then beatrice and henrietta is fucking heartbreaking"	
11377,"This episode was so good."	
11378,"Wait, I thought Evil Morty was coming back this season?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh shit wrong show"	
11379,"This show had never made me cry, but this episode got me good"	
11380,"This scene literally made me hyperventilate and weep at the same time. Dead serious."	
11381,"I literally cried in that episode."	
11382,"ANIMATION ITS SO FUCKING GOOD AND THE SCENE AND THE HISTORY THIS SHOW ITS KILLING ME AND SHIT ON MY GRAVE"	
11383,"3:39 it was creepy as fuck"	
11384,"My mother had a diamond like that"	
11385,"This episode had me fucked up on so many damn levels"	
11386,"This....this episode..... *THIS WHOLE MOMENT* hurt me.....the writing in this one just tied everything together...and I love it...but also hate it for messing with my emotions lol"	
11387,"wow!! this is both dark and disturbing"	
11388,"The best part of this and Beatrice's whole story this season is that it feels like it could radically alter the way we rewatch the earlier seasons. And shit, how much we're paying attention to the coffee thing in this one."	
11389,"this season is my favorite so far. so dark yet so funny and excellent. everything bojack horseman is about."	
11390,"The animators really went to town with the dementia story. They really outdid themselves with this episode. Best example being the simple hat appearing suddenly after the line hat in hand.\n\nEasily the best animated show at the moment comedy and feels wise. Don't know how they will top this season."	
11391,"After watching this dark scene and it begs me a question with that pregnant part. How did animals get birth by a either a single furry person and a human person? No animal was born like that and there's only one horse baby got release out by a human woman. I guess that in Bojack's universe has to have multiracial connection between animals and humans. Too bad that Princess Carolyn couldn't get a mouse baby like that."	
11392,"Gross bestiality shit"	
11393,"No wonder Bojack is fucked."	
11394,"Title change!"	
11395,"So fucked up"

11402,"Rick and Morty: This is going to be the darkest season yet!\nSouth Park: We already topped that you bastards \nBojack Horseman:....CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!"	
11403,"Season 4 was lame, 2 and 3 are way better"	
11404,"for as much depth they put into the characters I imagine they pitched all of this Netflix with their response being the Beatrice backstory is way to dark let's ease the audience in with existential terror, drug overdose and taking advantage of a teenage and see where it goes from there"	
11405,"I'll never hear that's a lot of fish the same way again."	
11406,"so if Holihock is not Bojack's daughter, and her dad doesn't even have a diamond shape on forehead, how come Holihock has a diamond too..."

11431,"The guy playing Westinghouse was the guy in Revolutionary Road with Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio- I just figured that out!"	
11432,"Was wondering when Tesla would show up. Wonder how they'll manage to glorify Edison with Tesla in the story, if they stick to telling the truth!"	
11433,"Nikola tesla should have been the main role in the film... Not the cheater edison the plagiarist."	
11434,"Really was about to give a thumbsdown & a comment on how Edison is a douchebag (check the Oatmeal comic) and then Tesla made an entrance :-)"	
11435,"At last Electrical Engineers will have their moment.... Lol"	
11436,"i love benedict but i'm team tesla here"	
11437,"Reminds me of the Prestige."

11439,"How about a movie on Nikola  Tesla"	
11440,"Country circuit between visit writer joke violate honor."	
11441,"Edison's one of the world worst dickheads in history, stealing others ideas and making its own. Nicolas Tesla by example. Fuck this movie. But I still respect mr. Cumberbath"	
11442,"Yes! I love movies with Bendelsnatch Cringleton! I mean Bendersnath Combertash! You know the guy I mean.."	
11443,"So it's a three-way fight between Edison, Tesla and who's the third one."	
11444,"I got tingles when they announced Tesla..."	
11445,"If it has Benedict cumberbatch I'm watching xx"	
11446,"Isn't it interesting that today we use Edison's DC and Tesla's AC all the time, but for different purposes? Could AC work inside your mobile phone? Could DC be used to power a city? Possibly, but it would be a totally different world now."	
11447,"Has anybody's reputation been more trashed than Thomas Edison?  I'm not saying it's inaccurate just that there's a surprising amount of media about him being a bigger jerk than Tesla"	
11448,"Tesla Coils can kill enemy soldiers and destroy tanks and will keep you military bases safe...\n\nUnless they damage you power stations."	
11449,"Didn't think I would like this, Edison been serious crook and all, but nice save with Tesla at the end."	
11450,"Ahh, Tesla. They caught the good ol' Balkan mentality in the end of the trailer!"	
11451,"Parker? Doctor Strange needs your help to change a light bulb. Oh and to fix the washing machine"	
11452,"If its about Nikola Tesla, then I'll watch it. Edison was 99% hype."	
11453,"who else here because Tom Holland?"	
11454,"Thomas Edison was a fraud and a thief, stealing other people's ideas and claiming it as his own."	
11455,"Benedict always has to play a genius doesn't he..."	
11456,"So We have Dr Strange, Spider-Man and Beast will they gonna kill General Zod  ?"	
11457,"Here's hoping the soundtrack will be by AC/DC ..."	
11458,"Anyone tired of Hollywood continuously trying to frame negative ideas behind men who where geniuses at the time? \nMore bullshit, and even though Tesla is a genius,  edison was still years ahead of his time. \nP.s. the people who run hollywood are currently trying to destroy americas legacy of innovation, so keep that in mind."	
11459,"Edison used Tesla then refused to pay him. Sounds very familiar"	
11460,"I love Thomas Edison, I love Benedict Cumberbatch, but sorry I can't suspend my disbelief to watch Benedict as Edison. And the trailer is not helping."	
11461,"Stopped the video halfway because I already knew that I'm watching this. Of course my bro-crush on Cumberbatch helped. I mean come on - who else could make the Edison, Westinghouse, Tesla rivalry exciting? (at least on the big screen =P)"

11482,"Telsa was so underrated in US history.  Edison took credit for his brilliance.  This movie looks awesome and its even more awesome how they make Telsa the bad ass of the film bc he was the one who changed the world."	
11483,"Why can't we have a Tesla movie instead srsly"	
11484,"Quick note, Edison did not invent the light bulb"

11837,"I thought you were going to say that you would not take the chemo and the zanex at the same time. But maybe at least for the year that you still have to do the chemo pills. Hopefully after the year you won't need zanex anymore anyway. Remember to get your support systems going for when you're feeling down. I'm so glad to see you getting better all the time and figuring things out with a great attitude. 	)\nThe only time I ever felt like I was going slow was when I had a high fever as a child and I was delirious too. It was an awfully strange feeling and very scary."
11838,"Hey girl glad you're back to normal and your speech sounds great!!! Glad you got things sorted out! Xanax is super strong and does crazy things to a lot of people so don't feel bad! xo"	
11839,"Your speech is amazing in this video❤️it's come on so much and you speak so quickly it's so brilliant to hear!! If you're still feeling anxious maybe you could trying practicing CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) obviously just a suggestion and I definitely haven't gone through anything as traumatic as you but it has really helped me feel better and get my anxiety under control❤️"	
11840,"Hey just found your channel. Much respect for sharing your story. I wanted to extend myself as an outlet to answer any questions you may have about other people in similar situations being helped by medical grade tinctures derived from the cannabis plant. Sending positive vibes and a big hug! Keep fighting."	
11841,"Good luck to you.  It's a shame Xanax didn't work for you, but good you figured it out so quickly.  As you said, everyone handles meds differently.  I was on anxiety meds throughout chemo and found them helpful, but I guess I was lucky that the particular med I took didn't interact with the particular kind of chemo I received.\n\nI can't believe the jerks saying not to take chemo, or that whatever snake oil they read about on Facebook would cure cancer.  Nobody without an MD has any business telling someone how to treat their cancer."

Exercise , yoga and you still need light amount of sun , look into tinctures herbal to detox , juicing and raw fruit and veggie diet and you will beat this in a month or two believe these words I speak they are poisoning you and do not continue if you wish to live , this advice is with love , if you love to live quit the chemo on all levels it's not your fault they have tricked and manipulated the population it's a money making , that's it all it is they have killed my family members and dine my research and saved others , look Up DR.ROBERT MORSE ON YOU TUBE HE WILL SAVE YOU YOUR DREAMS ARE TELLING YOU WHAT YOU FEEL INSIDE IS NOT RIGHT GOD BLESS YOU AND PLEASE HEADE THIS WARNING AND THIS ADVICE IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE , PEACE AND LOVE TO YOU PLEASE GOD SAID TO TELL YOU THAT THING YOU KEEP THINKING ABOUT ,THAT IS BOTHERING YOU , YOU ARE RIGHT COME ALIVE AND BELIEVE IN YOURSELF NOT YOU AND CHEMO CHEMO IS EVIL ,GOOD LUCK YOU HAVE A NEW  PLAN NOW START  NOW  PLEASE .....!!!!!!!"	
11900,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT DO CHEMO OR RADIATION THE DOCTORS ARE WHAT THEY FIRST SUGGEST WHEN YOU HAVE CANCER WHEN THEY KNOW THE FRICKING TRUTH THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IS THE SOLUTION WHEN THE SOLUTION IS THAT CANCER IS NOT AS BAD AS WE THINK WE CAN GET RID OF IT NATURALLY BY JUST CHANGING YOUR DIET ONLY VEGGIES AND FRUIT AND NOO MEAT AT ALL THATS IT I HOPE YOU READ MY COMMENT GOD BLESS YOU ."	
11901,"chemo is mustard gas and was created by the Nazi's.  It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube."	
11902,"I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden."

11916,"Now what? Even this clown is reviewing phones? He basically collected all negative side of it and made a video.\nListen, S-Pen has more precision then a finger. Ask people who used it since the original Note. People do a lot other stuff with it, not just to open apps.\nIf your finger is so small that you don't need an S-Pen. Most of us find it useful. \nFunny when a pc builder review phones. He hated the phone before he even put one on his hand. Just search the August 23rd video when he's with other reviewers."

11920,"I love this new style of review video you put out, Linus. :D"	
11921,"It has a smaller battery but many people have uploaded videos showing the Note 8 out performing many other phones including the S8+. \nEveryone has been hating on Bixby but I was blown away after seeing a Siri, Google and Bixby comparison. Bixby is smart and is growing more intelligent every day."

11924,"Thank you for the honest review, instead of just jumping on the band wagon and saying it's awesome. I have a Note 5 and much prefer it over the Note 8. Samsung also downgraded the camera by 4MP. Note 5 has a 16MP camera! That curved displays are just plain stupid, makes it way easier to break."	
11925,"OLED, AMOLED, Super AMOLED, Super AMOLED HD - I just wish they had a universal language - this is the first time in years I have heard a Samsung screen be called OLED - most recently the LG V30 - if its AMOLED just say AMOLED why confuse the words jezzus"

11927,"Soon you'll praise the iphone 8 for no reason ..."	
11928,"They are not gonna change everything for you. At the end of the day it's their phone.  They keep the s pen cause that's the main purpose of the phone and to have big specs..not battery. What do you expect if it does it almost all? And they aren't gonna do everything right away. They did pretty damn good, you aren't getting good speakers right away so calm down, they had other things that were needed more."

11939,"I'm confused... what wouldn't you give up 200mA hours of battery life for, the S-PEN?   That's nuts.   200mA is insignificant compared to the value the S-PEN brings to the device."	
11940,"You are tooo harsh on Note 8 \nSpecially when it has all the features which even Flagship phones don't \n. \nThat way you should roast normal phones \nI don't see you harsh on normal phones"	
11941,"Adjust my grip and start writing? What? Dude you sound like a female OMG! Just whining and whining and whining WTF dude!

11948,"Not an impressive review, but then again opinions are what makes the world go-around I guess. If you can replace the s pen with your finger, boy I would love to see that one...lol. The dual camera is a plus for me, IMO. Too much clownish batter Linus,  but then again some people like to be entertained....You missed this one Linus, thumbs down!"	
11949,"Hahaha you are very funny... very bad video... you tried to much to make this video... dislike of course"	
11950,"I like the Note line but this #8. Way crazy over priced IMHO. I also think the S8 is over priced as well. These phones have just gotten too expensive over the years."	
11951,"Holy cow your entire staff has tiny hands. I'm a 17 year old Asian kid. I'm average height and weigh under 130. My note 8 (got it a week early thanks Best Buy) is perfectly sized for fingerprint. So either I have big hands or you have Trump hands."

11972,"I was told that if you play a YouTube video on note 8, it won't be in the full screen! It will be the same size as Iphone plus. Is that true?!!"	
11973,"I prefer the Note 8 because i don't really like the curved screen on the S8+. Otherwise it's basically the same as the S8+. Think i wasted my money but whatever"	
11974,"Remember IPhone Users... if it wasn't for Samsung deleting the home button, there wouldn't be a Iphone 8"	
11975,"can't ask for more, this phone is perfect\nfor the artist, jot an idea or painting everywhere or even serious work with a smartphone are great,\nbut other manufacturer didn't even take a glimpse on bringing the digitizer stylus to smartphone\n\nI didn't even ask for that dual camera and that zoom\nbut the idea of jot some semi-professional photography idea straight from the phone are like a Christmas gift\n\npeople are bullying the idea of having an active digitizer on a smartphone,\nbut just respect it, many people are willing to pay 1000$ and more just because the idea of getting productive everywhere,"	
11976,"Still can't wait for the Pixel 2"	
11977,"I agree with Linus!  I have the s8 .I say Samsung should just add an s pen and dual camera to it. And put some stereo speakers too! There's  nothing special about the note 8 except that's it's as big as a buiding. I need to also say Bixby sucks ."

12033,"Kelly is back. 90's are back! This song is damn good, bitch! No need sex, booty, etc. To show how music good is. Breakaway kelly! Haha"	
12034,"OMGGGGGGGG I LOVE HERRRR SOOOO MUCH. I love a curvy woman who still can rock her confidence in any clothes. Kelly, you still have that voice OMGGGGGG lady, come by singapore, have a acoustic session with few fans and i'll be there. :) Love so softtttt"	
12035,"Omfg people stop complaining about Kelly's weight ...\n1.she just had 2 kids within the last few years and it might take her longer to get that off. \n2.she is a singer /songwriter not a fucking model. \n3.just because she's not a size 0 does not mean she does not have issues Kelly has even spoken in the past that she has had weight problems and its always been an up and down thing with her .\nStop acting like you are perfect , if you don't like it then go watch someone's else's video , Kelly has many fans who care about her and does not need judgemental people."

12040,"I love how the backup singers actually have representation in the video."	
12041,"Its saddens me to once again see so much negativity towards Kelly and her weight.  She's so beautiful inside and out.  Why does anyone feel the need to say such things???  When Kelly looks back on her life she will see nothing but love despite her father.  What will you see?  Someone that leads a negative life with judgement,"	
12042,"WOW! \nAmazing and beautiful... I Love it! 👏👏👏💖💖💖👸"

12507,"what the first song at the beginning... it's seungkwan voice right?"	
12508,"George Michael was a precious gift to human kind. A musical genius -phenomenal singer, songwriter, composer, arranger & producer. I wish we could have some new music from George but this Remake is undoubtedly a pleasant surprise. Thank you George for the music! Thanks Nile Rodgers & everyone who brought this out!"	
12509,"This is one of my most favorite of George's songs. Miss you George."	
12510,"the more I listen this the more I like it"	
12511,"So good to hear Georges voice in such a remarkable way ..♡♡♡♡ love it.."	
12512,"This is not a new song. This was a B-Side from 1992."	
12513,"https://youtu.be/z-TBIQlDv4E"	
12514,"feels like hes back///wow///'who releases his new CD? miss him !!"	
12515,"this is the first time that i feel nile rodgers did a realy bad job. this remake has no energy at all, the drums have no punch, the vocals are so overcompressed, just that funky guitar all over the place. \nthe original was so much more fun, with its rattling drumloop and the weirdo synth-brass. as you could maybe pick-up in videos, george was a heck of a producer and so very much in every detail, he never failed to amaze."	
12516,"And it is not over, it will surprise us again.\nGeorge we remember you so, happy and not sad. Because you're genial"	
12517,"Fastlove (a draft of original interpretation) or cynical hate&violence expression https://youtu.be/rOAerng9m_Q"	
12518,"Thank you for publicizing this track and making it possible for George Michael's fans to hear what he was working on. I listen to his music every day and I still tear up and cry (when I hear his voice) because I miss him so much. The world is a better place because of GM. I guess the old adage that 'only the good die young' is true. George Michael	 a once in a lifetime treasure. <3"
12519,"Great song"	
12520,"Has anyone picked up anything in the lights in the windows in the buildings?"	
12521,"Miss YOU and Your beautiful voice , it's gonna be strange in 2 Months to hear last Christmas"	
12522,"George has much better tracks than this sitting in the vault.... release them !"	
12523,"I love the original version and love what George and Nile have done with the remix. Listening to interviews etc. he had done during his career, I always got the impression he loved to move forward with his music and wasn't scared to try new things. I particularly loved, towards the end of the recording, when he does that little petulant sigh after he sings the line I may be in the next state	 so clever, so Georgex"

12527,"Fantastic song and fantastic new mix/release"	
12528,"Great tune! Miss GM so much :("	
12529,"GREAT JOB NILE!!  I love this song.  It was good to hear George's voice again as well.  Hopefully some new stuff will be coming soon."	
12530,"Is this a newly discovered vocal found in the vaults of his past recordings, or is it a reworking of his vocal from the original track from the '90s?  If it's a reworking of the original, I'm not a fan of how, at different points, they messed with George's vocal on this compared to the original. His voice sounds less robust, and, when he hits the Fantasy high note his vocal sounds a bit more coarse and not as clear as compared to the 90s version of Fantasy, which, I must say, I like better."	
12531,"I love it this new version ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"	
12532,"I love it!! Tank you M. Nile"	
12533,"Like this version better. Glad I'm not hearing obnoxious horns in this one."	
12534,"Love it. Funky track. Love you George ❤"	
12535,"Just makes me feel sadder....Sounds nice but like it should be on Faith....Would rather George was alive and making new songs.....But thank you all involved for this....x"	
12536,"Good production, not sure that's how George would have done it, but good anyway!"	
12537,"Is this love or invention...............?"	
12538,"...and David Austen...you're a star...no wonder Yog loved you so much... And Yioda and Melanie thank you for allowing us the pleasure of listening to new George...a true beautiful Greek family xxx"	
12539,"Thank you so much to Nile, David, George's family & team for this. When hearing this I felt a liitle bit of the excitement that I used to feel with each new George's recording. But it's not the same.  I know music is here to enjoy and that was George's intention but my heart is still heavy... I need more time. Well, I will place an order for the LWP & MTV Unplugged though... I have them on cassette and VHS only :-)"	
12540,"Can't get enough of this.   No one sings it better than George. Miss you so much  😢👊💥❤🌟 this is GOLD"	
12541,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but this is an old song re-recorded with a Nile Rodgers riff added."

12547,"Miss you George Michael u made me who I am"	
12548,"Sounds like remixed cr@p to me. I had thought that Nile Rodgers would have been able to do more with this old mediocre 'B side'. Are they going to release any of these 3 new albums we've heard of?. \nOr else, release 'Love is a losing game' or 'Russian roulette'. Those tracks weren't on the live Symphonica album."	
12549,"wonderful, wish we had some visuals too...love that man! Sexy George bring it on!"	
12550,"I love you so much, George! I miss you so badly..."

12557,"I miss you George!!!!!I love you Forever!!!"	
12558,"I've followed George Michael's career since 1984 .In the early days I bought every release on 7 inch for the house and on cassette for my car.I remember buying waiting for that day when it was released and after playing it I turned over to the b side to play having never heard of fantasy.I remember the first 3 clicks of the song before it kicked in.the first thing I thought after the first hearing was,what a waste for a b side.this would have hit no 1 no problem instead of the no 23 which waiting for that day reached.I'm so pleased it's finally reached its audience and showed how awesome this man was.is this as good as the original.No,but there's no dance track that every will be,but this new version is still stunning.Why? because it's George reminding us all how nobody could write,produce and sing like him.I miss him terribly and I'm so thankfully to his family,Nile Rogers and David Austin for putting this out and showing all these so called pop stars how it music should be done.Thank you for saving my life through your music George.R.I.P."

12956,"Don't *bee* scared 	)"
12957,"No American talk show host can touch Graham Norton!"	
12958,"Notice how borring it was when Graham came out, atleast on Grahams show he is so energetic from the word go lol"	
12959,"Anyone who hasn't seen the Graham Norton Show should take a look at any of the very many short excerpts available here on Youtube (TIP: click on any GNS interview with Miriam Margolyes: his best guest and one of the most outrageously funny story tellers you'll ever see.)\nYou will also immediately see why his shows are so successful and just how good he is. The format for a start (Graham in an armchair with three celebs on a nice sofa) is completely different from the typical US talk show which always looks like an office: a large table with the host seated on an office chair looking like he's about to give a job interview! It's dire and so out of date..."	
12960,"England is my City..."	
12961,"The greatest democracy in the world. Ugh, American arrogance never ceases to amaze me. 123 of 192 countries on this planet have a democracy. How is your any greater or less? I put those comments in the same box as land of the free, a lot of other countries are, too, free, if not moreso."	
12962,"American late night talk shows definitely could learn a lesson or two from Graham Norton."	
12963,"Graham Norton shows how its done, its like he takes this show over. He is a burst of life.."	
12964,"I really liked this interview even tho it was a little awkward at times but im glad graham is getting the attention. he really is a great host, and if you watch his interviews you see that not only is he genuinely really funny but he doesnt ask the same old questions that hosts tend to ask."	
12965,"I freaking love Graham Norton!! He is awesome and his talk show is great!!"	
12966,"He almost brought up Matt Damon! 😂😂😂 I think they got a sharp looks from producers. Don't bring that up!"	
12967,"He is so charming, I love this guy."	
12968,"Roddy Doyle needs to be on here graham is an embarrassment and a crap personality"	
12969,"Graham Norton's probably the GOAT in the way of talk show hosts and so many Americans have never heard of him"	
12970,"Yep we'll see just how wrong you ignorant people are when Trump not only wins a second term but actually makes America better than before. But of course you'll just keep acting as if his approval ratings are low (which is a lie if you did fair polling it would've been higher) and probably make some new shit up about how he won because it just can't be because people agree with him now can it? Stopped watching Colbert regularly since he just talked Trump every damn time. Comedy show hosts have become like the rest of hollywood, unoriginal boring and washed out"	
12971,"Graham is the best host ever!"	
12972,"Graham is also a good interviewee. I'll get the book as my simple way of saying Thanks from afar. Your interviews are certainly entertaining."	
12973,"I have seen a lot of talk show hosts but nobody is better than Graham..!"	
12974,"I think Graham Norton's one of the most entertaining show hosts."	
12975,"Graham Norton is the best talkshow host in the world, because he can put guests at ease and have them doing and saying things like no other show."	
12976,"I love when Graham asks why Dump's poll is not zero yet."	
12977,"I love that when Stephen says You give them alcohol?!, it is basically confirming that he has never seen the show before. All of his compliments prior to that immediately became redundant."	
12978,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY FOR SO LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"	
12979,"its really weird seeing him on the other side being interviewed. He's sitting awkwardly because he doesn't know how to answer questions lol"	
12980,"I love his shirt/pocket square combo! Is that Alexander McQueen? Awesome!"	
12981,"Graham and his show are just soooooo much better than this twit Colbert, in every way."	
12982,"Stephen Colbert seems like a ball sack"	
12983,"They also have Theres May. Totally incompetent and just like Trump, visited disaster site without meeting the victims."	
12984,"he forgot the best of all he played fr noel furlong"	
12985,"TGNS is the only late night show I can stomach to watch now, since Craig Ferguson went off the air.  I've always had a bent for British humor though.  Both their interviewers have always had a much more organic and relaxed feel to them, mostly because they don't conform to the traditional staple of questions suitable for US network television."	
12986,"one of the popular tv personalities in the uk? stephen he is the only tv host worth mentioning. the other one is a blabbering idiot jonathan ross"	
12987,"Father Ted"	
12988,"That sandwich analogy was perfect."	
12989,"The greatest American talk show of all-time was The Dick Cavett Show. Guests drank, they smoked, and they talked about literally whatever they want. Sometimes, guests had nothing to plug and went on just because they felt like it. Even though his show is more celebrity-oriented, Graham Norton's show is the closest thing to what Cavett was doing. Once they get the plugging out of the way, that's when Norton starts having fun with guests (of which there's a real variety of talent), and they love him for it. Colbert is fine -- unlike Fallon, he can actually conduct something resembling a conversation -- but his format and his attitudes are much more conventional. Colbert presents himself as a good liberal but his corporate masters would never allow the sort of irreverence that Norton's show allows."	
12990,"One of the reasons why UK talk shows are so much better than American ones is that they have several guests on at a time, so that they can interact, which contributes far more to hilarity than just one guest and the host talking!"	
12991,"3:03 What the hell was that supposed to be? Spamming musical ques like it's fucking Leno."	
12992,"This short excerpt from the Graham Norton Show shows why he and the show are so popular. You'd never see guests talk like this on US chat shows:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H9_7wwgd1Fc"	
12993,"The fact that Stephen asked Graham if he really offer his guests liquor proved that he has never watched the Graham Norton show nor did his homework as any interviewer would do. Asking about how to get guests to interact in a show is exactly why Stephen should be watching Graham's show. He can learn from Graham how fast and relevant and humorous his response is. Unlike Stephen who is always and only know to bitch about Trump on his show. Stephen comments and response are almost always boring and uncreative. Unlike Graham who doesn't need to make offensive and rude remark on anyone and yet is almost always super funny and insightful. I can continue to make the comparison but I shall stop here. Point is Stephen Colbert is boring"	
12994,"Graham should sub host an American late night show. He really knows how to work a couch, it's like watching ordinary people have good chinwag at a party with the most outrages stories! I fail to recall an episode I didn't like. Love ya Graham 😘"	
12995,"Graham is infinitely better than Colbert"	
12996,"But why aren't they zero? Hahahahahahahaha. Love you G."	
12997,"Lol, shooting fish in the barrel is Colbert's entire shtick."	
12998,"He is a National Treasure😂😂"	
12999,"Hey it's Graham 👍"	
13000,"Can this cunt go JUST ONE INTERVIEW without mentioning Trump???? You're a damn good interviewer Colbert but the constant political yammering is ruining late night!"	
13001,"Graham Norton is my current favorite host, it used to be Craig Ferguson but he quit e"	
13002,"This is so weird to watch xD Two different words collid"	
13003,"It's pretty fucking funny how Graham is subtly insulting Stephen, especially about his useless comedy writers and shooting fish in a barrel."	
13004,"Hands down, Best Host Ever! Definitely setting the bar high. I admire how he makes every interview with his guest enjoyable and fun. It shows, but many have also commented that they genuinely have a good time on his show ☺️👏"	
13005,"form i like  this one!dejply  force  ."	
13006,"Stephen can't stop talking about trump. It's getting booooring🤣"	
13007,"Can that fucking fag Colbert go one minute without bitching about Trump?  What a fucking ass clown."	
13008,"He farts @ 4:56"	
13009,"Rocket museum candidate pdbfl reputation suburban count slight tunnel last animal."

13015,"love this man"	
13016,"From Ireland though"	
13017,"Good job Graham!!"	
13018,"Entire interview merely illustrates how banal and unsophisticated Our television hosts and the entire fucking audience is. Graham Norton is dropping joke after joke with acerbic, dry, classically British humor brimming with pointed wit and gets crickets.\nWe as Americans have taken obtuse to a whole new level."	
13019,"Who tf says rick-uh-luh it's ree-cola"	
13020,"Graham Norton is the best.... he's so causal during this that it seems almost wrong! He needs a glass of Chardonnay and some question cards in his hand!!!!!!"	
13021,"Graham's show is all about having fun. That's it. It's just a fun time with celebrities and the audience. It's pure gold!"	
13022,"I miss Jon Stewart. Does this guy even have a sense of humour ?"	
13023,"AMERICANS HAVE NO IDEA WHO GRAHAM NORTON IS."	
13024,"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeees!\nThis beautiful British bastard!!!"	
13025,"Graham!!!!!! I saw your face and I could click fast enough!!!' When is your show coming back on!??!!!!"	
13026,"Graham Norton, the best host ever! Those US boring and rude hosts have nothing on Graham."	
13027,"i feel like every stephen colbert interviews goes like bla bla bla chit chat yeah that movie right?and at some point *HOW ABOUT TRUMP THO?*"	
13028,"Graham is one of the greatest things to happen to TV!"	
13029,"Love Graham my favourite tv host"	
13030,"Norton's show is the best chat show of all time simply because there's several a-list superstars at any given time and no censorship. They can swear as much as they like and he's the funniest interviewer."

In America, the host is very controlling of the conversation, and its more like a job interview than a talk.

There are only 2 main highways that go North through Florida, and if you’re trying to leave the state, good luck hopping off and refueling. Last thing you want to do is run out of fuel on the road when the storm is coming. This is the bad scenario with FL, when a storm affects both coasts. There’s nowhere to go but North."

13326,"Awwh it's so lovely to see how you're putting together your house- it's looking absolutely lovely, and that home sense looks amazing! I know this might have been filmed a little while back but just thought i'd ask if you know which red lip stick you are wearing on the last clip? It's the perfect shade or even if  anyone knows of one similar it would be a huge help :)"	
13327,"Excellent video! Such an amazing sponsor- wow! Do more like this!"

13337,"I love all the things you found in Homesense!  I'm from the US and I have a TJ Maxx and Homegoods (same as TX Maxx and Homesense) right next door to my house and I love going in there but your Homesense seems to have much better higher quality things.

Whenever I wear a fuller coverage foundation it never lasts on my skin, I find that I produce more oily even when it's a matte foundation. My skin is very dull but I try and take care of it the best I can. Shall I stay away from a higher coverage foundation? Is it why I'm getting more oily throughout the day? \nI would just like a long lasting foundation that doesn't make me skin look dull"

Would love to see you gorgeous girls teaching this in a matte lip👄\nAnd I just watched your Favorite Lipsticks video from Nov '15 and, just my personal opinion, but your current longer hair is just very youthful and stunning!! Much love from Alabama❣️"	
13533,"Yes, haircut. I vote just above shoulder-length (like you suggested), possibly a shag. You've got enough hair that that would look so killer. :-D"	
13534,"Hey Sam. I really like the look of those but will be hard to choose which colour to get. On the hair front - I recently cut my hair into a choppy bob and I love the shorter hair. Go for it - it hair - if you don't like it, it will grow back xx"

13559,"looking gorge as always Sam! i love the colours done it again and starwomam! and about your hair i think you should keep the length but make it less heavy giving it lots of texture. the colour for autumn looks fab, maybe more of those chunky cooper highlights/balayage through the ends keeping the base colour!"	
13560,"I think you'll cut it no matter what we tell you, the idea is already in your head  😂 I just went through the same thing and chopped mine off 🙈"	
13561,"Don't you dare cut your hair! You currently have the cut of my dreams but my hair is not thick enough for that. It looks sensational!"

Two when they were kittens (12+ years ago) and a rehomed cat, 1-2 years old (the previous owner couldn't remember exactly how old he was...)\n\nI remember getting my kittens. My other cat had died a year earlier and I missed having a cat so much. My mom would drive us to the Humane Society every week to check for kittens. The third week they were there! A little older than I was expecting (12-14 weeks), but the Humane Society probably waited to put them up for adoption until they were a little older.\nI'm definitely a cat person. They're awesome."

If you find an stray and hungry cat(kitten) meats like bologna and tuna can be a good temporary meal, remember that KITTENS need specialized food because they are still growing"

13610,"My kitten was weaned young. If you have a kitten like this buy it a bottle (even though it doesn't need it) and every few day give them about a 1\2 tablespoon of milk. This will make the kitten feel more at ease with not being around mum. I did this with my baby boy until he bit through his bottle. It really helped him relax and he quit crying."

13613,"I absolutely love kittens.  After the kitten is... 'dispatched' and skinned, remove the head and tail, trim out the larger meat fillets, dip into a mixture of beaten egg and basil, coat lightly with breadcrumbs, and bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  Serve with mini red potatoes, asparagus with a drizzle of lemon-butter.  The me - yow factor is off the charts!"	
13614,"I hear everytime that appartment cats have to have another cat as a playmate. Because as i was young we had a cat and he didnt had a playmate. And my cat doesnt have one either. Just me and my family. But a friend says everytime that my cat needs another cat as a playmate. Is that true?"	
13615,"Adult cats are pretty awesome choices too if you are looking for a cat. No potty training, they still bond to you, they are chill (most of the time). Even when I adopted the really mean older cats, they turned into cuddle bugs after a few days because they are out of a stressful environment. :)"	
13616,"and this is why you set up the camera first. Simon never learns."	
13617,"Oh you quickly learn not to give your cat milk even if he loves it so much and meows so desperately when you have milk in your hands - cleaning the litter box of cat diarrhea is not my favorite."	
13618,"Nicky gives so much of wrong information away. No good for anyone who really relies on that information. Many people have already written about the information:\n- no milk (kittens and cats are lactose intolerant)\n- leave the kitten alone when it just arrived and allow it to settle\n- adopt at least two kittens, not only one\nWhat I haven't read yet is about the age. Adopting a kitten when it's only 6 or 8 weeks old, is way too early. Kittens must not be separated from their mother until they're at least 12 weeks old! And please make sure that neither you or a family member has an allergy against cat hair before adopting."	
13619,"Flagged and reported this video as hate speech."

13621,"What about don't tickle a cats belly unless it's learning as it's not really something a cat wants nor accepts most of the time. It shows its belly as trust not as a sign for a belly rub."

13627,"There are 2 cats in my neighborhood that I feed.  The boy enjoys leftover milk from my morning cereal.  The girl will generally leave it alone- unless the boy is around to drink it."	
13628,"I like the way she says Kitten!"	
13629,"Milk no no cuddles, love,  playtime, and sleep ( with or without human) excuse me, my kitten is halfway up my curtains!!!"	
13630,"what pisses me off is people dumping kittens on the side of roads when shelters cant keep kittens there always adapted out. its fully grown cats and dogs that they have issues finding new homes for."	
13631,"Good points. I like the presentations with Nicky. Lots of good information for cat parents or people thinking about becoming cat parents."	
13632,"Good job recommending the shelters and rescue facilities.  They have so many cats both kitten and senior that need good homes!"	
13633,"I love Simon's Cat videos.  They remind me so much about my own four mystic moggies who, sadly, are no longer with us."

13635,"Can you do What Things You Need To Know About Adult (or Senior) Cats?"	
13636,"You should probably say another animal's milk or cow's milk. It's strange and unhealthy for any being to drink the milk of a different species 💙 Not to mention the cruelty involved in obtaining milk from the mother."	
13637,"can you do a video on feral cats?"	
13638,"I prefer 1+-year-old cats over kittens.  Sure, kittens are cute, but older cats are more level and easier to train (*less* distracted).  Also, you should point-out the importance of teaching basic commands (sit,  stay, down).  Many people let their cats get away with little/no training without seeing the complete joy of having a properly-trained cat.\nNeither of my cats had issues with milk.  They never got a lot, but a tiny bowl one or twice a month was a special treat.  Fluffy (20) even liked a little melted ice cream…when we had room in the freezer.  Tony (14) just liked a little milk, especially when he'd try to steal it from my Coonhound, Lilly.  You could tell that it was a power issue because he NEVER did that with Sue (15), our late Heeler mix."	
13639,"That was very informative and very entertaining to watch good job Simon"	
13640,"I do find some of the narratives helpful and I learn something new everytime I see an episode!!"	
13641,"She's a cutie."	
13642,"Loving this! I am the proud foster mommy of 5 tiny tumbling tigers.  It's so much fun to watch them learn and relate to my 4 adult cats, who have stepped in to help care for them by disciplining them, washing them and of course, playing. Trying to get staged photos of them is exactly like this, the minute one poses beautifully, one of their siblings or an adult cat steps right in."	
13643,"Dear Simon's Cat friends. This is a public forum that kids looks at. Dropping F bombs arguing about cat food is ridiculous and juvenile. Remember, yours is just an opinion, not fact. Everyone is entitled to theirs. My cats are 14 ,15 and 17, are super healthy and have eaten Purina dry for half of their lives. Now they have Iams dry food. NO wet food. They have great teeth and seem really happy and playful. That works for me and them, but maybe not you. Be happy your pet is healthy and stick with what works for you. Try being nice to other people, and your pets will think you're pretty cool for acting like them."	
13644,"My cat would follow my mum around every morning meowing what sounded like milk until she gave it to him. It wasn't until he got older that he had trouble with milk. He couldn't tell rice milk apart from cow milk. Either that or he didn't care. Later both he and his sister lost the ability to digest any kind of cat treat. We still wanted to reward good behavior. They had no problems with their kibble. So I simply put some kibble in a separate container. When they earned a treat, I got some from the special container. They were just as excited as if it were something other than what they always eat. So presentation was all that mattered. Cheaper too."	
13645,"The end was Savage as fuk"	
13646,"i love the cats 😻😻😻😻"	
13647,"My cat is highly lactose intolerant lol when she was a baby she used to get sick from her mums milk but she's healthy strong and beautiful"	
13648,"I just said goodbye to my senior kitty. The last thing I really wanted to do was bring kittens into the house but I was alerted to 16 kittens desperately needing homes. I took 2 home. I  am nursing an injured leg and need to rest it a lot.  The kittens insist that my face is the best place to lay down and sleep. I realize how bored I woul be without these 2 kittens!  Figaro and Octavia."	
13649,"Is it true that, for a kitten, playtime is just as important as a good diet? I don't remember where I got this information from. The kittens that I've ever had, when they wanted to play I did my best to provide play time. When they wanted to rest, they were allowed to rest. They grew up to be fine cats."	
13650,"I have a kitten named Zeus and each time you cuddle with him he'll start sucking on a blanket or Whatever he can reach, i know this is from him being away from his mother too early, but i was was wondering if there is anything i should do?"	
13651,"We recently got a beautiful black kitten from a rescue shelter. If anybody wants to see her then there's a video on my channel!"	
13652,"You can buy Cat milk :)))"	
13653,"Cats are lactose intolerant, like me. My cat loves yogurt and ice cream, like me. We fart together"	
13654,"Do yourself a favor and get an older cat from the shelter. Kittens are super cute but older cats are less likely to get adopted so they need you more. Plus they are much calmer and you will know exactly what kind of character they have. If you have ever experienced the havoc a kitten can wreak on your home, you know what I'm talking about."	
13655,"It's a common misconception, that cats need milk. Is it? I always thought everyone knows, that cats WANT and LIKE milk but as all mammals they don't really need it. I was mislead by my brain... O.o"	
13656,"my cat sometimes goes on the couch, stick her paws into the cushions, then whips her head around meowing before doing flips and turns. If anybody is wondering she's a tortie calico mix."

13676,"I have used that toilet seat cover trick for about two decades, lol. She is right. It's like the exact same texture as oil blotting papers."	
13677,"I love how Amy was such a British girl, she used rimmel I'm a little shock. Also I love how Valli use all the tools that are in style now and she's very knowledgeable about all the new trends. She's awesome. Great video"

13682,"I feel bad noticing Lisa's winged liner in a video about Amy Winehouse's makeup, but I can't help it. I reckon it's done with black or grey eyeshadow. If there isn't a tutoria already, I'd love to see one"	
13683,"Amy did wear a lot of orange blush that had a highlighter like shine and would sometimes wear blue under her bottom lashes (blue liquid liner) but that was more 2003-2007 Amy Winehouse. She often wore a hot pinky red liner too"

13697,"What an amazing video. The model has such a beautiful face and the end result looked so much like Amy Winehouse. Valli made it look so easy when she was adding the subtle touches of highlight around the eyes - such talent!  Thanks, Lisa and Valli for this video."	
13698,"I looove how the model resembles Amy so well"

13700,"I love intelligent makeup talk. ^_^"	
13701,"I can't stop watching this Video!!!"	
13702,"Did anyone else just beam at the beauty of Lisa as soon as her gorgeous face popped up at the beginning? I can do my own makeup well but if I were famous I'd let her do my makeup in a heartbeat."	
13703,"Love ❤️ this makeup artist 's rings and the sound of her bracelets jingling.  ✨"	
13704,"Lisa make up tutorial for your look at the beginning of the vid please ❤️💘💗💋"	
13705,"you guys don't have seat covers ????"	
13706,"Her voice is Sooooooo soothing! Such a lovely lady :) love her jewellery btw🤘"	
13707,"Fabulous! Kate the model was working it giving us the Amy Winehouse vibe!💋"	
13708,"This was amazing. Please make her recreate the Anne Hathaway look😍"	
13709,"another great substitute for brow gel is hairspray. just save an old mascara wand, wash it and spray it with hairspray and go through the brows :-)"	
13710,"Oh, Lisa! Thank you so much for that!! Just one let stated how thankful I'm for your time. What a beautiful homage! So nice of O'Reilly for of accepting your invitation. Thank you, thank you!"	
13711,"Love your lip colour here Lisa and the lip colour used for the model :)"	
13712,"i love russian red ❤️ (its a lipcolor everybody looks great with 😁)"	
13713,"Love it!!  So great to see such a cool Amy/retro look accomplished WITHOUT huge swathes of contour/bronzer & near white blocks of undereye concealer."	
13714,"Hi Lisa!  This was an absolutely fabulous video. Thanks!"	
13715,"It's a tip i learned from the drag queens in the 80's... I could listen to her life experience all day long! <3 Two classy, talented and stunning ladys! We are so blessed to be able to listen to these ladys. Thank you youtube. And thank you Lisa! Love from Germany!"	
13716,"This was such a respectful video, and beautifully done. Starting off by stating I didn't design this makeup look, Amy did was just so honest and a real tribute to Amy's passion for retro looks and music. Wonderfully done!"	
13717,"FINALLY A NEW VIDEO!"	
13718,"This was so good!!!"	
13719,"I enjoyed this video so much, thank you Lisa. Please do more of these if you can"	
13720,"Thank you Valli O'Reilly!  Wow this is one awesome video, such iconic makeup artists!  Love you Lisa and thank you for creating the best channel.  Hugs from the USA!"	
13721,"Brow tip: take a creamy, unscented lip balm (like Aquaphor - which rarely helps chapped lips anyways), squeeze a bit on the back of your hand, then dip a clean spoolie in it and brush your brows with it! They will stay in place without looking like they're all stiff and rigid.\n\nPS. Lisa, the fact that you bring other make up artists on your channel says a lot about you. Mainly that you care about spreading knowledge and that you are confident enough in your skills to not make the channel all about you. Much love x"	
13722,"What an incredibly light hand!"	
13723,"Lisa, thank you so much for inviting Valli here, and for your lovely model. Your own makeup is beautiful here too - so fresh and glowy."	
13724,"Love it. Thank you Lisa. Your channel is in a class of its own."	
13725,"Lisa, Please do a Nicole Kidman look you did on her at Cannes this year ! Thank you !! xx"	
13726,"İ just love listening to you. Your voice is so relaxing. İ can listen all day :)"	
13727,"Amy's look was one of my all time favourites, I had no idea she designed it herself!"	
13728,"Thanks Lisa for always showing us something different and sharing not just your knowledge but also your fellow make up artists friends! It was great to see in action such a big name in the american cinematographic make up industry."	
13729,"Lisa you are a beautiful human being. I love how you invite guest artists for them to share their talents and tricks as well on your youtube channel."	
13730,"I miss Amy so much, it's the first time I cry over a makeup tutorial OMG"	
13731,"So stunning and I learned so much. 💗✨💗✨💗✨"	
13732,"I'm jealous of the models eyelashes!!! She's gorgeous"	
13733,"Wow what a treat thank you Lisa !!!!!!"	
13734,"I hope the model dos wear it home on the underground. She looked amazing. \nAnd I loved the fact Amy was advocating British makeup brand rimmel. She could have used more expensive brands bit she stuck to her roots. \nMakes me love you even more Amy . RIP xx"	
13735,"Beautiful work, beautiful model, favourite channel ever. Thanks Lisa, Valli, and Kate!"	
13736,"Omg the model looks so much like Jen Atkin!"	
13737,"Its funny how actually working and famous makeup artists like to use very simple inexpensive products a lot while all these youtube muas use all this expensive stuff and balk at using glue stick as eyebrow gel. I absolutely love her tips and her nice wearable look! I love how you're able to bring on the MUA's who actually did this looks on the celebrity. \n\nCould you do an authethic 1920's silent movie makeup Lisa? I know it won't be too pretty when its accurate and not tailored to 21st century tatses but would be great education."	
13738,"You mention Anna May Wong in your book as a makeup muse, it would be lovely to see a makeup look based on her."	
13739,"I miss Amy Winehouse so much that I can't even listen to her music without crying 😢"	
13740,"AMY! ❤️❤️❤️ I absolutely love this!"	
13741,"The video was ok but the instructions for the eyeliner were missing and that is the most iconic part"	
13742,"She was delightful! Thx Lisa & Valli❤️"	
13743,"This is iconic. I'm thinking of stealing this look. Wonder if it will work with my pixie hair cut"	
13744,"Realy enjoy every video u make 😍 super inspiring 🙌🏼"	
13745,"Wow!"	
13746,"wow!"	
13747,"Wow this is amazing!!!!"	
13748,"I miss Amy :("	
13749,"Obsessed with these videos!! 🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹🌺🌸🌹"	
13750,"I love her."	
13751,"Beautiful"	
13752,"Thoroughly enjoyable, thank you Lisa!"	
13753,"😍😍😍😍"	
13754,"Love the matte lip tip"	
13755,"Beautiful. Minimalist. Clean."	
13756,"amazing"	
13757,"Oh, Amy... 💔"	
13758,"Amazing!"	
13759,"please do a lana del rey inspired look!!!"	
13760,"Does anything happen to your eyelids and under eye areas after years of putting foundation on them instead of concealer?"	
13761,"Lisa could you please do awesome looks for silver/grey haired ladies...how to do natural looks and more glam looks. We have the tendency to look dull or washed out if makeup is not properly done, especially for fair skin. Pleeeease"	
13762,"Lisa I miss your tutorials done on yourself.  Please do a nice fall look xx😻😻"	
13763,"I have a Rimmel lip liner in Red Diva....is this the same as the one she mentioned called Diva?"	
13764,"I absolutely love her rings!! What amazing jewelry... Any idea on possible brand? lovely tutorial as usual!"	
13765,"oscars son Devon and his latest fight video\nhttps://youtu.be/PNmWB6Zo4KU"	
13766,"De La Hoya is taking a lot of shots at Mayweather. He's just jealous and bitter."	
13767,"To get to fight you have to be signed with a promoter Stone age"	
13768,"I was riding with Floyd since he Pretty Boy way before Money May days. But I love and respect all boxers my favorite sport."	
13769,"18:28 YES FLOYD MAYWEATHER WAS SIGNED TO GOLDEN BOY OWNED BY OSCAR DE LA HOYA"	
13770,"Oscar De La Hoya SNITCHING on Floyd!!!!! Floyd and Conor completely FUCKED UP the GGG/CANELO fight!!!! No one cares about this fight now!!!! Mayweather threatened to do it last year on Cinco de Mayo weekend!!!! Now Oscar comes to hiphop radio to promote this fight!!! Mayweather vs Canelo totally eclipsed this fight"	
13771,"Oscar De La Hoya you are a true Champion dear Sir and an honor to the sport of Boxing, you spoke with truth and honesty in this interview, Respect!! p.s I know is in the past man, but sincerely I always thought you won that Tito Ortiz fight way back then."	
13772,"21:40  He said Louis Armstrong was in his top 5 boxers.  Joe Louis is who he probably meant to say"	
13773,"TBH if golden boy didnt exist boxing would be boring and dead!"	
13774,"This dude is a clown 🤡"	
13775,"Its not floyd fault there wasnt anybody out there that woulda been favored over him lol wtf oscar talking about?"	
13776,"How are you a cross-dresser and coke head and say what you don't like about somebody's personal life?? WTF"	
13777,"I'm sooooo glad CTheGod asked him about the lingerie pics 👙😂"	
13778,"This was a good interview"	
13779,"😂😂 oscar still upset floyd whooped that ass, is still undefeated and a few hundred milli up 😂😂"	
13780,"She stay asking the worst questions ever wtf"	
13781,"I can definitely respect how he answered the questions about drugs and alcohol. He didn't even flinch and that's a hard thing to admit that it was the hardest fight in life and you're getting knocked down every day. They did ask about mayweather a lot even when he was talking about other stuff. But overall, this was a great mature interview"	
13782,"Del La Hoya is a legend without question."	
13783,"Floyd beat your wanna be well spoken college professor ass. Take it like a man"	
13784,"hard time in my life.. wtf kind of response was that.. was he crossdressing and getting paid to give blow jobs on the street?  rofl wtf.. I would have just said that i was with this crazy broad and was drunk and made a fool out of myself.. something..  jesus."	
13785,"Someone needed to call out Dela hoya on A LOT of statements here. Him saying old school fighters didn't carry each other is completely wrong, they did it all the time so older fighters could get more fights in the future EX: Sugar ray robinson vs. Henry Armstrong."	
13786,"this guy is confused, he talks about if you can change your life around ( mike tyson) ... but cant respect Mayweather for what he did back in his day..."	
13787,"Oscar is now saying it's a farce and a circus for Mcgregor to have taken a boxing match???\n\nWhen this fight was first coming together Oscar said he wanted to sign Mcgregor and it made all the sense in the world for Connor to fight Canelo.\n\nThe video is here:\nhttps://www.sportsjoe.ie/mma/oscar-de-la-hoya-wants-conor-mcgregor-to-come-and-fight-for-him-105407\n\nIs there one damn interview where someone calls Oscar out on this??? WTF."	
13788,"Envy : so tell the people what fishnets are..."	
13789,"If your fighting all the time and you have to be aggressive all the time, i'm not surprised dude got all coked out and ended up doing some freaky shit lol."	
13790,"This dude proposed canelo v mcgregor. Hypocrite just mad he isn't a part of the $$"	
13791,"I know this fool ain't talking bout what's disrespectful to boxing when he appears in many photos wearing women's lingerie looking like a Tranny!"	
13792,"Oscar it's legend"	
13793,"This guys such a lier he wanted to match mcgregor with canelo LOL"	
13794,"Fishnets? He had prostitutes put dildos in his ass. AND THERE ARE PICS OF IT!!!!!!!! Don't recommend googling tho 😩🙈"	
13795,"Everyone who follows boxing has always said this about boxing-that it sucks because the best are not fighting the best at their best and it's all corrupted.  I think the sales/viewers  prove this statement..."	
13796,"Wait, Tyson Rape a women , he loves him. mayweather is in an abusive relationship he hates him"	
13797,"He dont even know whos on the undercard"	
13798,"Wow..... hypocrisy!!! how can one harper on about another mans domestic violence, are you clark kent??? are really that a against it or is it cause Floyd did to you what he did to that girl??\n im so lost... since when do crossdressing crackheads have an opinion?? but lowkey..  when you think about it, a crossdressing man would have an issue with domestic violence.."	
13799,"Charlemagnes one and only purpose in life is playing a black victim"	
13800,"I watched Cotto vs Kamegai that same night and I still saw the whole Mayweather vs McGregor and trust me the Cotto fight was WAAAAAAAY BETTER!!"	
13801,"Oscar is 4 yrs older than Floyd when they fought Oscar was 34, Floyd was 30. He need to stop acting like he was damn near 40 and Floyd was 26 or something."	
13802,"He won't hit women just dress up like one WTF ctfu"	
13803,"CTFUUU  I died when I spoke on the fishnetgate!!! Yo I remember he was in fishnet, heels and boxing gloves ... SAVAGE ..Thank God, Oscar is in a better place. He looks great!"	
13804,"Who really cares about the opinions of an alcoholic, cross dressing rapist"	
13805,"I don't get this comment section, they make fun of Oscar for cross dressing but yet they support the fashion of an artist that cross dress like young thug and Kanye fashion line🤔"	
13806,"Also, don't act like your dad doesn't do coke. Its a pretty common drug. It's not like he was smoking meth behind a dumpster, let's be real about that. People just hang on floyds nuts so they use his same insults."	
13807,"Hoya is kinda speaking the truth! we see better fights on WorldStar!!!!"	
13808,"His lefty pinky finger is so fucked up..."	
13809,"Mayweather surpassed your legacy and is in many people's top 5 List. The envy is apparent."	
13810,"De La Hoya knows jack sh*t about MMA. Conor McGregor ain't sh*t an is not the very best. He ain't even top 15 in any weight and that's being honest! He's not fighting the very best. The very best he fought was Jose Aldo who hadn't lost in 7 years or more, never gave him a rematch.  He fought a scrub to win the LW title and won't fight the best now at Lightweight. He's protected."	
13811,"hmm.. so mr De La Hoya respects Mike who also had woman abuse chargers, but he doesnt respect Floyd for the same thing ..."	
13812,"Such a liar. Canelo fought at 155 (above Super WW) for 2 years then comes into fights at 175! But he's not a middleweight?!?!"	
13813,"Mayweather beat him and his whole stable he shouldn't really speak on Floyd. We all know If he was involved in the that fight he would've been telling everyone he gave Connor the blueprint"	
13814,"They set him up....to clown him for someone (guesses?)......street shit....do you see the gay flag in the background right behind his head....they prepared for that fishnet question about something 10 years ago and that question is relevant how now?"	
13815,"Charlemagne tryna see how Oscar looks in that lingerie 😭😂"	
13816,"Oscar was lieing on that last question he filed bankruptcy before so he must have done something dum with money"	
13817,"Charlemagne first question is the shit.non English speaking guys"	
13818,"Oscar is mad he missed out on all that money!"	
13819,"Disrespectful to boxing? Thats funny because De La Hoya wanted to have canello fight mcgregor before all of this"	
13820,"What was going on with you in the ligerie? Hahaha."	
13821,"Oscar De La Hoya admits he LIED about drag pictures	 his punk ass paid $20 million to model to keep it hidden!"
13822,"he gives off a sleazy car salesman vibe."	
13823,"Please, if Oscar put this together he would not be talking all this sht"	
13824,"You can tell he did something really gay and is really embarrassed"	
13825,"I'm on vacation in Portugal day of the fight, anyone know if they show the boxing matches down there? I know in other countries they have PPV fights for free."	
13826,"Oscar De La Hoya is speaking the truth GGG vs Canelo is a real fight nobody is gonna be punching themselves out a great fight the whole way."	
13827,"DeLaHoya is funny to me.  He smiles, but he packs a lot of anger, which enhanced his boxing career."	
13828,"Pretty boy is now worth 5X's more than the Golden boy. LOL KARMA...."	
13829,"I appreciate Oscar's honesty here....and for those of you wondering, he meant Hammerin' Hank Armstrong, not Louis Armstrong (Jazz great)."	
13830,"Lol this is a maywether interview"	
13831,"Ahahahaha Charlemagne had to ask that lingerie question lmao"	
13832,"Pacquaio in his prime? HE IS 2 YEARS YOUNGER THAN FLOYD when was he supposed to fight him? Manny will always be younger than Floyd so waiting to fight benefited Pacquiao not Mayweather. \n\nAlso, Oacar was only 34 when he fought Floyd so ge was not over the hill. Floyd fought an in prime Cotto, Maidana and Canelo ALL after he was 34... \n\nAND! He was was the first promoter trying to get Mcgregor in the ring to v Canelo yet he mocks a Floyd Conor fight? This guy just talks out of his ass."	
13833,"Hahaha his answer tho , it was just a bad time in my life hahaha wat does that mean lol"	
13834,"I never did like the golden flake but I always thought the fishnet pics were doctored up. What a fucken FAG"	
13835,"That starbucks cup is his fix"	
13836,"Floyd proved that his old ass needs to stayed retired lol"	
13837,"Shoutout to the greatest GHANAIAN boxer for knocking some creative sense into oscar de la hoya. lol"	
13838,"Was it 4 million buys? Or 6.5?"	
13839,"Shout out charlagmane for asking the questions that everybody want to know but too politically correct to ask..."	
13840,"Oscar was a great boxer who never ran from anyone. With that being said, he seems like a hater in this interview."	
13841,"he has to ask that... if he doesn't: his core fanbase would slander him.... if he does: he's digging up past issues and a firestarter. Catch 22."	
13842,"He sure has been running his mouth, riding Mayweather and McGregor's coat tail lately."	
13843,"chalemagne keep bringingin up mayweather chill de la hoya gave him his props lol"	
13844,"Oscar a hating ass migo"	
13845,"Do you hate Floyd Mayweather Jr. ? Lmaoooo"	
13846,"Oscar sounding like a HATER"	
13847,"hahahahah oscar classy wow!!Charlemagne didn't even laugh he look scared"	
13848,"This clown smh stop hating"	
13849,"dela ho is a panzy"

14769,"If anyone knows who James Charles is, he said he hated IT because there was too much character development, plot development and not enough jump scares. Seriously, screw him."	
14770,"Sorry man but the movie isn't worth an A-. Watched it, didn't love it, liked it, but it's more of a C+ at best. More of a discount night kind of movie."	
14771,"Did the grownups *know* ??? Cos it kinda seemed like they did and accepted it and that made it even more evil"

14774,"well i think the book ending for chapter one is justifiable enough. Like it's almost a settled debate why bev does that exact thing."	
14775,"It was well made and the characters were charming, but it wasn't scary, just made me jump a couple of times. The comedy didn't always land for me except the gazebo part. There was a bit too much dwelling on their group relationship which past a certain point was unnecessary and dragged the film down, and the whole mullet bully plotline was stupid and dumb in the direction it went. 6/10 for me"	
14776,"Unfortunately, nobody can top the original Tim Curry 1990 IT. I watched this movie tonight with high expectations, although they were more accurate with the original book information than the original but........\n\nIn the end, this movie didn't creep me out the way the original did. The acting(besides Beverly and Richie) in this new one were just terrible and had almost no believably whatsoever. \n\nOverall, I give this new one a Solid B at best."	
14777,"It was good but... by the 10th jump scare I got bored."	
14778,"Tim Curry was and is the best IT clown."	
14779,"The movie was good. It's not scary at all... but definitely its a very good and entertaining movie  	)"
14780,"I LOOOOVED IT. (no pun intended)"	
14781,"Really? I just watched it today and I was yawning through the whole movie. I'm scared of clowns and I was pretty bored through out the film. The characters were really good I do give it that. I had a lot of laughs but scary?! No."	
14782,"It wasn't a really scary movie like I thought it would be, but I thought it was still pretty good. It was more like a coming of age kid film with some scary clown bits"	
14783,"Just saw IT. aAnd that shit was sick!!\nGonna see it again for sure. 🤡🤡"	
14784,"Good movie, but I mean, the CG done when he moves was just garbage, ugh.."	
14785,"I will agree that the kids did an okay to a good job acting. However, I didn't believe that most of them were friends. They didn't sell the friendship in this version which it needed to. Also, I don't agree at all with the love for Pennywise here. He was way too much jump scare and the CGI was bad. Plus the voice just felt silly not scary. Tim Curry was terrifying because he made fun of their fear. Go ahead and run it won't do you any good, girly boy. He let the fact he could kill them at any second sink in. In this movie he just chased them and didn't really interact. Also, that ending where they just wail on him? No mention of a strong magical force helping them, just straight up street fighter his ass."	
14786,"It was not scary at ALL! It was like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . Although sink blood scene was scary ."	
14787,"This movie was definitely damn good as all get out but it actually didn't scare me even a little bit, though then again I have been a gigantic horror movie buff for well over 20 years and have seen pretty much every horror movie known to man, so that MIGHT have something to do with it too lol!! But definitely a truly amazing and suspense-filled movie and then some, I give it an A+ all the way across the board!!"	
14788,"i thought it was goin to be a different type of scary movie, it was more funny then scary, the trailer threw the whole movie off of what it really was"	
14789,"They hardly got a single thing right from the book are you kidding? From the very beginning the piano is playing the wrong song. The mother played Fur Elise and stopped doing so after Georgie died. Now i liked the couple Easter eggs like the Turtle toy and a couple others but other than that it wasn't true to the book at all. The entire movie was all jump scares using visual jump scares and audio jump scares. There was no real creap and terror, not to mention Pennywise wasn't alluring and sneaky thus he wasn't scary. And after allll of that, they DID NOT make the people of Derry the scary part and show how fucked up the town was (Like you said they did). They had a single scene showing the actual people of Derry being shady. They also didn't explain why Henry was carving his name into Bens stomach, which there was a reason for, it wasn't just a random thing that happened. I could go on for literally ever about what was wrong with the movie but i'll save myself the effort."	
14790,"8/10 Georgie shouldve came back at the end"	
14791,"Just got back from seeing the movie, scared the shit out of me. Bill Scarsguard was great as Pennywise, his voice was creepy as hell!"	
14792,"Why did you ignore, or rather, chose to skirt around the fact that the scares are jump scares?"	
14793,"Dude the IT isn't a demon IT's an alien."	
14794,"I thought this film was terrible"	
14795,"The clown reminded me of simple jack, a few of his scary faces looked like someone with severe autism. A few other minor issues like the old well house looking cliche as fk and some scenes didn't transition/flow very well to the next but the positives far outweigh the negetives. Against other horrors- 9/10, against citizen kane- 6/10 ."	
14796,"I would like to be friends with adult Beverly"	
14797,"I just found the original series boring, seriously creepy clown in a drain , also stranger things is shit to, it's not scary , its a film/ tv show all the kids can watch with mum and dad. More Money"	
14798,"This movie was really good go watch it if u haven't seen it I didn't get scared but that's cuz I'm not afraid of movies but it's a good movie"	
14799,"Pleases her friends...? What the fuck"	
14800,"I live in Miami Florida. I evacuated and now staying in New Orleans, and still went to go see this movie."	
14801,"This movie had some creepy parts in it. But that God damn creepy woman from the painting scared the living shit outta me. Especially when she comes scurrying out of the sewers"	
14802,"that nes that nes i love that nes"	
14803,"I watched the movie today and IT was amazing! Hahaha see what I did there? Anyway, the actor who played Pennywise the Clown Bill Skarsgård deserves an Oscar nomination I think because he was that good! His performance was chilling, funny, terrifying, and downright breathtaking! I would like to see Bill Skarsgård in more movies because his performance was amazing! Highly recommend the movie IT!!"	
14804,"Hey Chris, I'm a big fan of your work. Your review of It seems to be on par with other reviews I've seen. I thought the movie was okay, but not nearly as great as all of the reviews say it is.\nI was wondering if I posted a video response pointing out all of the problems I had the with the movie, if you would do a rebuttal on the movie's behalf. It's not your opinion or review score you'd be defending, but the movie itself. Thought it would be fun.\nAnyway, keep up the good work!"	
14805,"came. back from the movie theater, wow,  I was on the edge on my seat"	
14806,"Disagree. Massively over-hyped film. Saw it with my 17 yo daughter. Nobody in the theater was scared, nobody. The Tim Curry original is far superior. Andy Muschetti's other film MAMA, is genuinely terrifying. The new IT also suffers horribly from trailer fatigue, wit the best parts jack hammered in trailers for the last 6 months. It's not a bad film, but falls way short of what was expected."	
14807,"Is this a sponsored video? It feels like things are going to pop out... are you being serious? Almost all of the jump scares are very predictable, the scene that truly made me jump was when Beverly smashed his dad and IT showed ITself."	
14808,"Why didn't you talk about how funny the kids were?"	
14809,"Was better than I thought it would be but definitely still think Curry was WAY better as Pennywise"	
14810,"I was never scared just creeped out.  Still excellent movie though!"	
14811,"Sorry gonna have to disagree with you on this Chris. The children's fears seem under-developed and cliche as a result.  Honestly the child-acting wasn't great, and I did not think Pennywise was all that unique or horrifying.  I was completely unengaged by the story and some of the CGI was absolutely awful. Overall there was no sense of horror or dread, and it really made this movie seem hollow."	
14812,"this is such an amazing movie"	
14813,"The movie wasn't that scary and I could tell some parts were cgi. I went watching it believing the hype. Waste of time and money."	
14814,"Why are people praising this film? It was garbage"	
14815,"Took your word ... movie was trash tho 🤔"	
14816,"the movie was great and very funny but no where near scary at all its. I personally think the movie is bullshit."	
14817,"Plz do a review on Jigsaw when it comes out"	
14818,"Bill skarsgård was epic as pennywise. Next iconic movie monster"	
14819,"This movie was really good. But there was something about it that really bugged me. Red Letter Media also talked about it, the obnoxious sound design. Most of the scares were just really loud noises. Aside from that, it's a really good movie."	
14820,"I loved everything about this movie. For horror movies we need great stories like this and this director delivered just as the actors did."	
14821,"One of my favourite books of all time. Hopefully this movie will do it justice!"	
14822,"What is the DVD release date for this movie, IT?"	
14823,"This movie was almost complete perfection and practically blew my expectations out of the water. Great movie."	
14824,"it's always difficult and awkward to hate on kids in films\n\nno it's not"

14834,"They mix the fear of clowns and have the 80s hype. I say this movie sucks, but will probably go see it."	
14835,"Loved this video. Great review. I made a short review of the film which is on my channel if anyone fancies checking it out. That would be sick. 😊"	
14836,"Chris, your videos are always spot on. I've even got your book, and I can't wait to watch every movie in it and read the reviews. I'm working on my own movie review blog, check out my It review at https://danielsmoviereviewsblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/it/ !"	
14837,"Watched just now.... and loved it"	
14838,"I watched it 2 days ago...Omfg this movie....IS AMAZING HOLY SHIT"	
14839,"it was a good movie im really not scared of clowns so maybe thats why i wasnt that scared which is weird cause im usually scared of scary movies i just dont think it was that scary. would i watch it again? Yes i would but i would have to be taken to it or on a date with somone just so then i have a reason to go."	
14840,"When pennywise was just talking in his normal form i absolutely loved it. He was so good but the cgi scary pennywise almost took me out of the moment but thats not bill skarsgard's fault he was great. Defiantly exited for chapter 2."	
14841,"If you think IT is scary you are a pussy bitch 😂"	
14842,"It was shit"	
14843,"I liked it mainly for the performances and good script, but there were too many dumb horror cliches shoved into scenes that just had no impact"	
14844,"Okay so here me out On this one. \nIn the original and the book when they are facing off against pennywise in the sewer Eddie say this is battery acid you slime and sprays his inhaler in his face and it melts him and later when he tries this as an adult he is killed. I was looking forward to the this in the remake but it didn't happen but the I thought about it and they gave this moment to Richie in the remake when he grabs the baseball bat so that makes me think they r gonna kill richie in the  at the end instead of Eddie??????"	
14845,"Saw this last night, SUPERB ! Far better than it should have been, far exceeded my expectations. So the creature 'IT' is a demonic entity ? Is this confirmed ? Always wondered exactly what 'IT' was.  Anyway, i loved it was set in the 80's (got Goonies/ET vibe), that haunted house was just so good .......too much comedy for me though not enough cool music (minor gripes). Bill Skarsgard nails the performance. I believe Sophia Lillis is going to be an amazing actress, was blown away by her."	
14846,"Fuuuuck I'm not going to be able to see this the in the theater"	
14847,"I went and watched this last sunday....this is the first horror movie tht actually made me screamed... Like seriously screamingggg!!!..but all so very satisfied.... God i really like Eddie and Billy... Their are so cute. To those who hvnt watch this...1000% recommended this to every single person on the planet. 9.7/10 rate."	
14848,"At first, I really liked this movie. A lot. \nIt didn't really scare me. I get that the horror could be viewed as the icing on the cake. I jumped at the jump scares, but that's because if you see something pop up in front of you, you're gonna jump. You're kinda programmed to do so. It didn't really leave me with a lingering fear though. I kinda just went home and had a good night's sleep and then didn't think about it. I actually got home and thought Well, that was a good movie. I probably won't remember it in a few years, but I enjoyed the experience. \nThere were multiple scenes I liked. The intro was good. The scene where Bev was sobbing and cutting her hair off after her father compliments it is amazing. The scene where the blood comes out of the sink was good. I liked Richie's jokes. The cinematography in many places was great. The special effects were great too. The acting was great, good casting all around.\nBut there were times when Pennywise seemed more funny than scary to me. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself at times when he was onscreen. \nThe more I thought about it, though, the more I realized it was kinda a paint-by-numbers movie. My rating got worse the more I thought about it. Now I'm just kinda at a Meh, I liked it kinda feeling. Not great, not bad, just pure entertainment for a quick thrill."	
14849,"Anyone who says this isn't an excellent movie can seriously fuck off. What were you watching? Do you have a brain? Do you understand film and creativity in general? These are questions you need to ask your delusional ass"

14967,"The problem with suddenly pronouncing things the way they are originally meant to sound is that everyone then thinks you're a cunt.\nImagine joining a conversation with some friends about Paris, but every time you speak you say Paree.  Thats right.  Noone wants to talk to you anymore.\nHowever the fact that some people can't pronounce Audi right IS fucked.  I'm looking at you, America."

15052,"Nice song but I have to admit that I have heard better (and more interesting) songs from U2. I know that I am strict but I don't like to compromise with nice but simultaneously indifferent songs from my favourite rock band. I have been used to hear the best music from this band. \nI really hope that the rest songs from the album will be amazing."

15055,"Sorry to be a party killer, but this is a very average tune and it has a really tired  sound to me - but what annoys me the most is Bono's flat and uninspired lyrics on this track - light years from the level of their peak in the 90's. To be honest, IMHO they have not released anything remotely interesting since POP. The fact that their latest tour is on their 30 year old Joshua Tree album sort of confirms that they have accepted their irrelevance, even though they have always been amazing in concerts. But, in the 1990's, they (and Nirvana) ruled the music scene!"

15062,"If this is a taster of the album then we can only expect something lukewarm and a little safe. When U2 stop giving a shit about being relevant then they'll write great music again. Great music is always relevant. They need to take more risks than this. I agree with a few others here, there is a lot of terrible stuff going on in the world, that's where U2 need to channel their energies. Protest songs, rebellion against Trump, against racism, the refugee crisis. Fucking hell, I dunno."

15073,"Seriously, why are U2 still making new music?! This is the blandest, by-the-numbers song they have ever released as a single, and a lot of their music falls into that category. I listened to it, and the painful experience was only made worse by having the corny, back-of-a-fag-packet lyrics on the screen! Music as generic as this really winds me up. Dreadful.

15106,"I personally love the song - great melodies, insane bassline, great guitar work from The Edge and the perfect drumming that Larry Mullen Jr. is known for. \n\nSo far, I find that some people are a bit iffy about the song and I think I found out why. The song takes a left turn at the very end and finishes with a noticeable change in melody. This was undoubtedly done purposely (probably to minimize predictability), but some people are saying they like the song but  also say they don't like the way it ends. I noticed the change in melody at the end on my very first listen and it does throw you for a minor loop, but I genuinely love the song (and I'm a tough critic). Hats off, boys!!!"	
15107,"what the hell is that ! It is time to stop to make music if U2 has nothing to share, the energy is gone now, it is musically flat and dull. I was fan long time ago,,,"

So it's likely some commentary on black superheroes in the movies and not an actual game mechanic.  Cartman is also a tremendous racist so of course he's gonna say something like that."

15191,"what is funny wit southpark is, that token, the only black kid is actually the richest kids in southpark, and that is more the reason why he 'didn't fit in.. In one episode he brings other black kids to town and they're all rich lol.. while all the white kids are poor. so maybe they might subvert expectation if they go token's route? And if anything this is a satire on us and what we immediately jump to conclusions."

15193,"Normal is Hispanic i guess."

15196,"well I'm not getting this game just because of this racist slider.\n\nplus the previous south park game was a disappointment."

15201,"i'm lack and i just wanna sayHell Yeah South Park!,Do it more...."	
15202,"What I love is that it doesn't really change the difficulty all that much.  The only differences are depending on your race you get more money or less and you get more racist dialogue.  And some other changes.  I love that this was just done to screw with people and I can't wait until October.  What I also love is Cartman saying that you're a newbie so you can only choose from 3 classes which means they'll have to be unlocked.  From what I seen on the classes section that were marked out,  there's like 8 other classes."

He watched it with them, explaining that coarse language was the result of a limited vocabulary/education. And since there was no way to avoid it, the best thing to do was explain it. Besides, he said the Morals of the stories at the end were of substance. This man is one great dad. To this day, I avoid the F-bomb among others in an effort celebrate literacy."

15229,"I imagine that how uncomfortable Chris got with the difficulty slider is precisely the aim, so mission achieved I guess?"	
15230,"9:08 There is a bottle marked plutonium in Cartman's closet, but that's clearly Butter's Creamy Goo... hmmm......"	
15231,"You had me at satiric social commentary in a goddamn character creator."	
15232,"having seen your guys playthrough at E3 I was hoping Aoife and Chris would do a full playthrough.  Aoife is so gung ho about the sick things that Southpark does and Chris is so disgusted by it all... it's halarious"

15252,"People in the comments: lmao, look at all the triggered white people here. They're so privileged, they just assume things about people's lives because they're too ignorant to look beyond their own.\n\nAlso people in the comments: The difficulty slider joke is so true. White people have it easy simply because they're white and black people have it really hard for no reason other than they're black. I know because I'm black."

15258,"Does anyone know if the map is the same as the last game?"	
15259,"Oh well, I guess I will just mod the game, so I can play as white on high difficulty. Or won't buy the game at all, we'll see."	
15260,"So, there will be no way to make the combat harder?"	
15261,"But....is the game actually out?? I need to know, please. I've been dreaming of getting this game since March"	
15262,"I think more games should do this, when it suits the themes of course. Not being Open-World for the sake of being Open-World"

15403,"Hazard and his brother looking cute. No homo."	
15404,"All we gotta do now is sign the youngest Hazard brother, Ethan, and we'll have signed every Hazard! It's just like collecting Pokemon. It's just a shame we let Thorgan go, because he's a pretty good footballer and would definitely help our squad out in terms of depth, especially nowadays. I'm not so sure about Kylian's talent though... He definitely seems like the weakest brother."

15581,"Love you LL. Keep doing what you do <3"	
15582,"I am glad you had this topic discussed with Afrojack. I will then address my comment to Afrojack. I discovered you on a Hard dance award cd, your mix of Satisfaction, I loved it and then became a fan of your first period. Then came the craziness of EDM and hearing the same sets and I got very disappointed. I went to see you at Ageha Tokyo to see your mix and I thought I was watching one of your stream in Ultra or Tomorrow and I got very disappointed. Then I understood today I might be one of your 10% fan base. I hope I can see you djing one day in a small club because may be I am getting old too and I like the surprise of djing. \nBack to Laidback Luke, thanks a lot for your videos, I am learning a lot."	
15583,"guys this video is amazing. Thanks for sharing your point of view and your way to DJ.\nIt's so interesting discovering how you guys organise and prepare your sets in order to have the best for your crowd"	
15584,"Totally unrelated, but I'm actually wondering how or where DJs and producers get song Acapellas?"	
15585,"I appreciate the honesty about the festival scene. I do like that you preserve the art in the club scene."	
15586,"I've been a DJ for over 20 years and I completely agree with Afrojack who by the way is also my favorite DJ, great VLOG guys!"	
15587,"@Laidback Luke thanks for bringing this topic up and for sharing both of your perspectives on it. It's a topic that often comes up and it was cool to see some well respected artists like yourselves shed some light on it. So looking forward to one day being able to see one of your life changing live sets <3\n\n@Afrojack  I 100% agree with what you had to say. The best sets I've seen are always the ones where the DJ can read the crowd and adjust to the situation at hand. Whether it's through crowd management on the mic or simply uplifting us through a journey of beats, that is always the difference between a good set and an unforgettable experience.  \n\nI have seen you perform at least 5 times in the past 3 years in Japan and Ibiza and not once have I ever felt like I have seen the same show twice. You continually set the bar for live sets with all the hard work and effort you put into your performances. They are always fresh with new stuff to look forward to. Your show alone is always worth traveling internationally for. Much love and respect <3\n\nLastly, no disrespect to Zedd, whom I also love dearly, but I gotta say that I was so thankful you guys brought that up. The first time I ever saw him in concert (Tokyo 2016), I had goosebumps and it was truly a mind blowing experience. The second time I went to Zoukout Singapore last year for him and it was a good show but it didn't feel as amazing as the first time. 5 months later at EDC Japan, no joke it was literally song for song the same set, same visuals, and it didn't even truly match the smaller built set. As a fan who had to pay $300 for a 2 day event (general admission), I felt disrespected and I was pissed. Still love his music and the beautiful creations he makes, but damn it was shocking to feel and eye opening to see this happen when you see what else is out there with amazing artists like you guys and Martin Garrix, and how much effort you all put into your live sets. \n\nThanks again for doing a video on this! Wishing you both all the love, happiness and success in the world. <3"	
15588,"Really loved the real talk. No bullshit, all real talk. Respect to both of you, since usually artists don't talk about it fearing backlash from other people. I'd really like to see more real talk vlogs like these in the future :D Cheers!"	
15589,"And on the other side you have David guetta who just hits play on a mix cd and can be seen with just one deck active the whole set. Put the effort in ffs."	
15590,"You forgot to ask if they belong in the DJ top 100. Not prepared? 😊"	
15591,"I see Afrojack's point, however I am part of the 10% that love to hear a DJ freestyle, I like to hear slight mess ups... it makes the mix more human. It's like that old school sound records make, just sounds more badass. As for forgetting to play certain tracks, put them in a 'must play' playlist? Preplanned sets etc if call performing, freestyle is DJing."	
15592,"100% correct. big festivals need to be prepared, especially when your on a short timeframe. But you definitely have to know how to read a crowd and play what everyone wants."	
15593,"Air conditioning on in there?"	
15594,"Yeah iv gotta admit ...great way to explain  this topic...They are not Dj's ...they are artists"	
15595,"I used to put playlists together for events as an Idea base, now my crates are for music organization... When I need that next track I know where to find it. Right now 99% of my sets are on the fly"	
15596,"Laidback, I really love this Video. Afrojack shows the real thing in Mainstream EDM and I believe it´s in underground too. It´s hard to found Dj´s doing that for real. I know it´s good to see people jumping, we know most of the people doesn´t matter if the Dj is playing or just jumping and clap clap clap, but is a real sensation when we see someone doing that, playing for real, not push a play button. You´re very right when you said about the art, producer art is not a DJ art, but now, we see a music artists milkshake in the Big Festivals and I really miss some pitch adjusts provided by badass mixing style, but we have it in Drum N Bass and HipHop, the art is live but not in Eletronic Dance Music. I´m a Dj since 1999, and producer since 2010,  I´m an old, but I preffer the old school djs and love all the time producers."	
15597,"Haven't been an Afrojack fan in years but holy crap massive respect"	
15598,"Afrojack is right that the kids who skip everything and go right to big festivals aren't djs, because if they ever needed to switch up on the fly they wouldn't be able to, since their sets are so preplanned and they lack the necessary dj skill. He was spot on about his views of mainstage too, and if you look in the comments of tomorrowland videos its full of people criticizing, even though they weren't actually there and are taking the set out of context."	
15599,"Juicy M couldn't agree more"	
15600,"I really don't think people like Afrojack, Dillon, Hardwell, Skrillex, Martin Garrix, etc give a fuck about the art of DJing I think for them its all about the money really. to be completely fair play to them"	
15601,"Laidback luke i love you sir coz you're real😊❤️"	
15602,"A lot of what afrojack said is true, also it all depends on what type of DJ you are, a producing DJ can get away with having a pre planed playlist cause 99% of their playlist are gonna contain their own productions as well as their own hit productions that are guaranteed to move the crowd. That's what afrojack meant by he rarely miss-plans a set. Cause he has had many hits in the past. BUT for DJs  that do not produce and do not have there own hit songs to depend on, most of those type of djs must DJ on the fly. They don't want to play what previous djs that night may have played. So it also does depend on who you are and what type of DJ are you."	
15603,"Very Very! Interesting topic to talk about, very important to identify the right kind of DJ for you. personally i prefer a live set does not matter is the constancy of a recorded set is not present."	
15604,"I saw Afrojack at Omnia Nightclub in Vegas awhile back and it was one of my favourite sets yet. Could tell he was live mixing and doing a very good job of it! Gets tiring seeing Dj's who are just a stage act on the microphone constantly and spending more time dancing than mixing!"	
15605,"Honest and down to earth. Always a pleasure to watch. :-)"	
15606,"Well, i usually prepare a setlist ti play it live.... what do you think?https://youtu.be/Hx6DkylEvAs \nCheck my remix for Avicii's without you. Check it on your PC please 	)\nThanks!."
15607,"this makes me angry. this is soo lame"	
15608,"+AFROJACK . Please Bring An Epic Show to San Bernardino Ca @Psycho Circus: Escape!"	
15609,"I agree 100% with the difference between club and festival events. I worked at Omnia Las Vegas for the 1st two years it opened & as someone who gets to see each artist every time they perform at the venue, you start to realize the difference between who is a DJ & who is just a producer. For instance, Calvin Harris nights are always the busiest at the nightclub but for someone who sees him every Friday night they get bored of seeing him because his sets are exactly the same to the point where I could tell you what songs he was going to play & when he was going to play them. Then you have artists like Krewella, Chuckie, Martin Garrix, & Afrojack who either plays completely different sets (actually djing) or what I've noticed with Afrojack, to where he plays a portion of the same set then (Usually once he starts drinking out the bottle) starts to freestyle. You can hear him trying new things, not always having a flawless set. Me personally I like it when I can hear a dj messing up from time to time because that shows you they are actually Djing, trying new things, living in the moment & their thoughts in real time & not just acting & pretending to turn knobs. Another reason why DJ Mag Top 100 isn't an accurate source for the best DJ's but that's a whole different discussion for another time."	
15610,"Thank you, like you say anybody could do it. I agreed. Thank you guys. Great video. Keep the DJ alive. Is fun."	
15611,"Interview Is Amezing And Afrojac's Ideas and his realty is making him genuine thats the good thing"	
15612,"NICE! Thank you luke and nick"	
15613,"Being able to watch talks like this is amazing. Seeing what really goes through the heads of the people behind the turntables/laptops/mixers as a fan is awesome. I've been a huge fan of EDM my whole life and, being a dj myself, when I go watch a set, I not only have a good time, I listen to exactly what the artists are doing. I am part of the 10%. I live in Miami and I HATE festivals like Ultra Miami. Artists go out to Ultra to bust out the craziest sets they've ever performed, but I don't feel the vibe and love of a festival at all. It just feels like a huge party filled with drunk and drugged out people. Seldom are there festivals where you can feel that the crowd around you really love the music that's playing as much as you do. And it's at these festivals where the artists and the fans really have a good time and feel the PLUR vibes"	
15614,"Very nice blog in times when a lot of people are thinking where is a border between almost recorded set and preparing for set, between show and art😊🙏"	
15615,"Great interview !! Congratulations for both of You for touching interesting topic."	
15616,"6:18 lmfao did the inner Borat of afrojack just come out??"	
15617,"these vlogs keep me rooted to the art of djing"	
15618,"Thank you so much for taking the time Afrojack and Laidback Luke keep posted please."	
15619,"I like to play with no playlist, I like the improvisation and feel the club, when a song that you play for example, the old one, was just a pinch on your set, but the dancefloor likes it so much that at the time you includ 3 more songs, this can only be done in the heat of the moment! But, I really feel the need to think about a set for a great show, now sometimes I have a VJ together and I already see the need to think in advance about some transitions and some songs that have cool visual effects for the public to see on the big screen. Today the DJ is not only music, it is a entertainment show and in this case a planning and a DJ planned up to a certain point is essential for the operation of all the functions of a great show."	
15620,"I'm not a DJ, i'm an artist and producer but I've been asked to perform and I did just that, performed. Today's DJ's are performers and there are those that are crazy talented such as: Youngr, Araab Musik, Arcane Echo, etc. those guys are all reinventing the wheel when it comes to performance. I believe DJ'ing got washed down with technology -- Most of what you learned Afro and LL respectively, has all been tucked into a simple button anyone can press BUT Your advantage is that you can read a crowd and your mental library are skills that no technology can replace. SO it's not DJing it's performing and if you want to see DJ'ing like you said go to a club or place where it's intimate."	
15621,"I've been DJing on and off for half my life (17 years as none of you will know my age), and done all sorts (mostly weddings these days, but that's by the by). Max crowd of about 1000, but in the last few months I've done some last minute (a few hours notice) sets in local venues, one was 30mins notice. There are people who are better than me at reading a crowd, I don't deny that, but at a few hours or less' notice (and with a young family at home) I just have a load of playlists in iTunes to group tracks by year (and if I have some notice, categories of music I know are popular / relevant). The order isn't fixed though - I may be a fan of doing certain tracks into other tracks, but if the crowd don't take to the first track of a usual selection I'll deviate. I do a fair bit of lighting and event production work, so I can fully appreciate knowing what's coming next - mostly in the clubs (even for Ministry of Sound tour DJs), it's mostly busking. But when I see a track is coming in that I know, that I know almost inside out, and I can see on a CDJ / Serato etc display when the kick drums etc are, then I can make it a damn good freestyle lighting etc performance to add extra impact to the sound"	
15622,"2 realsitic people talking about the real perspective of dj and music production."	
15623,"Regarding the sweaty armpits, now I realize why so many DJs wear black t-shirts on live performances and interviews. Great unexpected tip, though!"	
15624,"AFROVLOGS PLEASEEEEEEE!!!!!"	
15625,"My respect to all those Dj's the still actually mix live"	
15626,"Each side has their place, especially when dealing with big festivals. After all, it's about what the crowd came for, right? However, it's discouraging that the fundamental art of DJing is dying. And I think it has to do with: \n\n- EDM becoming more pop and mainstream over the years, attracting a larger audience than before. \n- Technology has made it now easier than ever for anyone to be a DJ. Thus, the advanced skill set is becoming lost. \n\nThank you guys for continuing to be an inspiration for all the die hard fans while still giving the masses what they want to hear!"	
15627,"So wack! Then what are you doing up there on stage? It's like paying to go watch Adele lip sync."	
15628,"Sorry for the booklet but here is my opinion/story:\nFirst off mad respect to those who dj on the fly with no preparation whatsoever. It takes guts to get up on stage and read the energy of the crowd an put together your set right there. to me this means you are comfortable with all the songs you have and have been DJing long enough to know what certain song will mix well into others, what songs will easily mix into other genres etc.\n\nI just mixed for the first all school party of the year at my university a couple days ago it was huge and of course very fun. However, I primarily produce music (deep house) and I've only mixed live for an audience 4 or 5 times before. I have seen many times people put together their own mix in Ableton or Logic  and then go up and press play one time and act like the were djing. and in a sense its a little frustrating to go up on stage after those people knowing they had no risk of screwing up.\n\n With that said, I spent a good deal of time practicing my set. I took time to figure out what songs would mix the absolute best into others so my set was as clean as possible. While I guess you wouldn't consider this DJing to me it is still mixing. I was still forced to find creative ways to switch tempos, and to change keys. It was just rehearsed.\n\nwhile I am positive I would be able to get up on stage and put together a mix on the fly (I do it in my room all the time), Im not sure the set would have  the same clarity and cohesiveness that my set had, and in a way I actually feel good about all the hours I spent preparing for this set knowing that it all came together exactly as planned and sounded good. So in a way it is a modification of the art. in my opinion I will respect someone who takes the time to carefully pick how their songs will mix together. the only people I won't respect are those who put their set together in a daw and felt pressed play once"	
15629,"Love these guys ..but live shows are play button 100% ...it has to be for the set to go just right..its the truth but whatever"	
15630,"I need to know this Song at 1:11, I didn't find it on Spotify or in the comment section . Can anyone help me out? :)"	
15631,"Why are they both sweating so much?"	
15632,"Dude you've been one of my fav producers since 2011. Any way we can get more music production tutorials, tips/tricks?"	
15633,"Awesome job at EDC this year!! You were amazing!!"	
15634,"I also want to stick things on my macbook!"	
15635,"Great interview. What is it that Afrojack has on the back of his lap top ?  Thanks"	
15636,"Holy shit this was great! Thank you so much afrojack for being so real and perceptive. Still love you the most tho Luke❤️"	
15637,"Holy god this was so real. Im 15 and as a DJ myself, I can see where you both are coming from. All the big DJs are catering to the crowd so much that it sounds like the same set over and over. I want my kids to hear a set and say, so thats what DJing is all about. I feel that DJs nowadays get lost within the marketing and money that they forget what a DJ truly is."	
15638,"great video! gave me a new way to look at the whole process!"	
15639,"the whole club really enjoyed your set in Albania ,Tirana ... \nno one cared about dj skills as much as everyone was there to have fun and you really made it all so much fun , and  ofc there was freestyle a lot i guess and it all sounded good tracks went well with one another if we see it from the dj skill side. The crowd was crazy , you were crazy .. hope you come back , much love from Albania !!"	
15640,"I think when you reach Afrojack's level, you cant risk freestyling anymore like you could in some local club."	
15641,"Artists just should be in duos, where one is a sick producer and the other is a sick dj"	
15642,"The truth is spoken....and its appreciated!"	
15643,"Not sure about this. I really understand that you dont want to fuck up in front of a million crowd. However, making a mistake every now on then on stage proves that it is live what the DJ is doing their stuff on stage. The perfect live set is different to everyone. I would prefer Afrojack playing crazy shit instead of ten feet tall, because you hear the hits (don't get me wrong, I really like them) all the time. And when I'm there I want to experience a live set with music that is beyond the regular stuff."	
15644,"I started djing 5 years ago and I find it a lot more fun to mix live than have a prerecorded set. You can learn from your mistakes , as they said you can play in on the crowd to see what they like , they know you're a real dj and so on.  I mean it's just way more fun to see all people going wild on a set you played live than just pressing play and acting like it's live. It gives me a much better feeling about myself."	
15645,"I know that the real form of DJing is very important and that is what represents how talented a DJ is. But now, as times changed... Being like Afrojack is what I would suggest. Does anyone realize that the preparation Afrojack is talking about requires talent? People will discuss how your playlist was, How the production was. Not how well a DJ scratched and Mashed up acapellas. So I would like to say that Preparing like Afrojack is also an art. Hope you will like what I said Afrojack & Luke"	
15646,"Much Props to Afrojack and of course Layd Back Luke... The Problem with making live Shows or pre-recorded tracks is that sooner or later it will become a trend and club owners and concerts will just be selling you that and eliminating the middle Man wich is  you guest it.  The DJ...."	
15647,"why there is this common idea that the crowd wants to hear always big banger hits ?? when i am at a live event i want to feel the beat, the bass, i dont want to hear the same shit again and again because i can listen to it every fuckin day on my phone ,on my pc ecc.. i like when a dj actually mixes and does something live , i hate when he has the mic in his hands and waves his hands saying 1,2,3, jump... this summer i went to a martin garrix event and i didnt appreciate every second of it becuase it was a clearly pre-recorded set, that's the main reason why i dont like edm. if you go to a techno  event, is totally different, djs play whatever they fuckin want and i can enjoy always new sounds, new mashups and something that's is real and different."	
15648,"Afrojack Mashup hahahahahaha how sad this makes me laugh and relate much... with face palm indeed"	
15649,"Spot on Luke and Nick!"	
15650,"Greatest educating video by far Luke, I was watching and listening so attentively, that I got a little bit upset that the video only lasted 13 min. way too short if you asked me haha! But on a serious note, hearing the mindset of two DJ's that basically have seen it all for me that's just fun and also inspiring, much love & respect!"	
15651,"great video , thanks for making this video but my personal opinion as a dj & music lover. I would rather listen too a dj mix live where it may sound a bit off at times  but i know there beat matching as opposed too sounding seamless like a robot with no beatmaching & every track sounding perfect. Just my personal opinion but big props to your videos & your music brotha"	
15652,"Thanks to AJ and you for keeping it real. When all else fails return to the basics The Art of DJing will reign supreme. Also If for any reason your equipment malfunctions and you need to need to do it yourself MaN Oh Man."	
15653,"Chris liebing is more talented then 90% EDM DJs"	
15654,"I agree everything, just eliminate laptop DJing! How bow dah?"	
15655,"Afrojack is garbage"	
15656,"Waiting for a AFROLUKE MIX!"	
15657,"no more fake DJs!!!! LBL and AF 4life!"	
15658,"pause voor die dab ff"	
15659,"why do djs always have wet armpits."	
15660,"<3"	
15661,"Netjes, was nuttig man thanks!"	
15662,"awesome video!"	
15663,"DJ = Disc Jockey... DISC JOCKEY"	
15664,"WATSKEBURTTTTT.... much love"	
15665,"Ben niet altijd even fan van Afrojacks muziek en houding maar hier heeft hij wel een mooi inkijkje gegeven in de industrie. Thanks Luke en Nick!"	
15666,"Ik ben zelf een dj en ik doe het als volgt. Stel ik speel een hele avond van bv 22u - 2u dan speel ik de muziek dat ik denk dat gaat aanslaan, bv als het nog rustig is wat tech en future house. Naar mate het volk toeneemt ga ik dan iets harder te werk, bv een black out van franky rizzardo  of een tujamo nummer. Als er veel vrouwen aanwezig zijn kan je naar r&b overschakelijk etc. en dat wissel je dan af, om je set creatief te houden. Als ik bv op een event speel waar ik 1 of 2uur draai dan zal ik mijn set voorbereiden door bv een afspeellijst te maken in recordbox en evt cue punten aan te duiden. Dit geeft dan een houvast aan wat je gaat spelen en door te weten wat je gaat spelen of toch ongeveer, kan je je extra richten op het technische."	
15667,"I'll just stick to the trance scene \nNo recorded sets there \nEDM and the idiots like vegas and like mike are what's destroying the art of djin \nThe only good thing from edm is that it hopefully moves these kids on to better electronic music like techno and Trance and away from the disposable sound of electro and all the other  crap played at ultra and Tomorrow Land"	
15668,"Almost every song you hear a DJ play has been pre recorded in a studio anyway, so a pre recorded set is no different, it just means the DJ isn't mixing live, therefore no errors or playing songs that don't mix well, giving a much more polished performance. A few DJ's actually create music during their performance, James Zabeila and Paul Van Dyk for example, that's as close as you can get to truly organic DJ'ing. Superstar DJ's can drop The Crazy Frog into the middle of a set and the crowd will still go wild so I don't really agree with this reading a crowd nonsense, maybe unknown DJ's in clubs have to read the crowd and definitely Wedding DJ's but superstar DJ's no."	
15669,"In its purest form Djing is an art. To be able to read a crowd, take them on a journey, draw tunes on the fly and seamlessly blend them takes years to master - John Digweed being a great example. At the commercial level (where Afrojack is) the art of djing is irrelevant because it's all about promoters and djs making big money by giving the masses what they want - which appears to be EDM garbage. I have no problem with people making bank, just don't proclaim to be an artist or be pushing the art of djing forward by having pre-recorded sets. I take my hat off to any dj and/or producer staying true to their craft and mastering it without selling out, because whatever they lack in earnings, their back catalogue and sets stand the test of time. Just look at Goldie (Metalheadz) and Andy C (Ram Records)  - the latter were pioneers but sold out and as a result their sets and output over recent years are a million miles away from their previous bar setting standards."	
15670,"honestly bro, much respect to bam n shit... but honestly bro we on the brink of ww3 and a racial civil war , theres 3 giant hurricanes destroying southern america, plus major flooding... NOBODY GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOU ANYMORE!"

15675,"Hey, Bam...\n\nLosing Ryan was an immense blow	 it sucked ass.\nAs bad as it was for us fans, we're all aware that it was far worse for you.\n\nAnd we lost you too.\n\nBut Today, I'm just glad your're still alive, man. We're ALL so glad. Just that
15676,"Great to see..not an easy feat to come back from by any means..respect."	
15677,"Gets a second chance at fame, no hating, hope you live well Bam."	
15678,"Bam used to be the only reason I bought Element stuff! Ahhh the memories"

15692,"Never stopped loving you bam! What a legend!"	
15693,"This bloke still hasn't grown up!"	
15694,"I have been a fan for longer than I can remember and seeing you comeback is one of the best moments you have given your fans!! I wish you nothing but good things my friend to you and your family!! Fort Worth, Tx"	
15695,"Killing it just as hard man!!!"

15715,"Over the past 12 years, whenever someone mentions skateboarding, I always 110% automatically think of Bam. To me, growing up, Bam was the face of skateboarding. He was what I associated skating with. Seeing Bam back at it again now, it just brings back nostalgia!! Who still has/wears Bam's clothing?? The Bam logo at the end of this video is the hoodie I have with pink font and logo!!"	
15716,"good to see he isnt so depressed anymore. gotta enjoy life while u can"

15726,"Fuck yeah, so stoked Element is pushing for his return to skating,"	
15727,"I said Bam would be dead a long time ago. I'm glad to see he is still kickin. I'm a recovering heroin addict. I have the faith to believe you can stay sober Bam. I worry that you might feel too much pressure to stay clean, and not want it for yourself. If you fuck up it's ok. Don't let the pressure of other people's expectations ever fuck up your recovery!"	
15728,"Who is this old man?"

15869,"Shakira is awesome, trevor noah sucks balls"	
15870,"IDEA:\nIt can be really coooooooool if in every token in every real booster will have a code to enter in the online game to get the cards you opened in the booster :O"	
15871,"Across format play please! It's why this will beat out MTGO. Help the DCI tie in with the game so that we can win planeswalker points with the mtg games! I'll let you guys know when I play the closed beta, and I'll pass it along to my follower!"	
15872,"I just want an online mtg game that lets me play commander with all cards available for commander that is well supported. I'd even be ok with something like legacy, or last resort modern."	
15873,"Q. Why did you choose to build MTG Arena instead of a new Magic Online client?\n\nA. There were a lot of advantages to starting fresh with MTG Arena. The team is building the game in Unity, which gives us more flexibility for future growth. We created a new Game Rules Engine that can better understand even the most obscure card interactions. We wanted to integrate modern online services that will create a dynamic overall experience and also someday integrate with other aspects of your Magic life.\n\n\nI know wizards is a business, but this is just pure greed. They might as well not candy coat it and just say the real answer..... $$$$$"	
15874,"The voices are wayyy to low.."	
15875,"This will be a success, if we can buy single cards, if we can play without paying for every match and if they include old cards/formats."	
15876,"Why the fuck would they choose a fucking hearthstone player and a thot to play this?  Give us some real players not this fan service"	
15877,"Hmmm, looks good 1v1, but what about the other formats 4 player or more? lets hope it gets everything set up for that as well :)"	
15878,"If they update magic duels I would glad give my money for it but seeing how they proceed with their business I would not give a penny for magic ever again, me nor my close friends. Keep in mind that important detail, uncertainty over a company and its products always leads to a downfall. Like if you Agree."	
15879,"Well this is nothing short of hideous. Don't get me wrong, I'll try any magic product, but digitalised mtg cards look fugly. Should've just looked like collapsible HD scans. If they were trying to be modern they should've gone and make a completely new look for them, but the modo vibe is just painful to look at."	
15880,"WotC, pleeeease offer code-cards in future booster packs. Please!\n\nI would like to play both, paper Magic, AND Magic: Arena, not just one :*(\n\nPLEASE!"	
15881,"This being only in standard is.... disappointing."	
15882,"That balance without a sleeve.\nI'M CRYING"	
15883,"What happens for people who took time in Magic Duels. I mean, I almost unlock everything in this game. Will I have to start over everything ? Or getting bonuses ?"	
15884,"This looks so shitty. Is this really what they are doing in 2017? The whole thing still looks like it's from the 90's"	
15885,"the need to make the text more easily readable. I'm pretty excited though for a way overdue mtg game that wotc actually puts forth effort into."	
15886,"Oh look, the Smash 4 to Duels' Brawl. Neat."	
15887,"I could be wrong, but I don't think most players care about these useless visuals and sound effects. We just want a more intuitive and functional version of MTGO. And you can improve aesthetics without making this into a hearthstone clone. Keep things simple and elegant."	
15888,"I feel that if Wizards doesn't have the resources to address the existing bugs in MTGO, I can't imagine dividing them and also adding in fancy visual effects will make development any faster. I honestly enjoy MTGO and I could recommend it more if there weren't so many bugs and slow downs. I hope this full rules engine or whatever delivers and makes it easier on their end as well."	
15889,"It looks realyl amazing for Beta, can`t wait to get my hands on this. I used to play Magic mostly in the Theros-Tarkir expansions, but then it was becoming a bit too much for me, if this works as I am imafining, this will be my MTG comeback."	
15890,"Already spent on magic duels why would I pay for cards on the new game ?"	
15891,"I think legendary creatures are also going to need voice lines in addition to planeswalkers. I'm not the biggest fan of edh but imagine dropping your commander and hearing a voiceline from the flavortext like leovold's I'm sure we can come to an agreement.\n\nI also hope there's an option to take away the flashy animations for the players who are playing for competetive practice."	
15892,"The way he dodged the question on how to get new cards in the game gave me a bad wipe ^^"	
15893,"Also it would be nice if the lands looked a little more different than the other cards, the borders are almost exact to the colored spells."	
15894,"Am I the only one who wants Shandalar 2?"	
15895,"WHY IS the WORLD PREMIER held in a BASEMENT? FAIL!"	
15896,"Looks really bland so far, that raging sowrdtooth effect needed more UNF for how powerful it is. Look at the animation of Mad Bomber in hearthstone."	
15897,"Girl Magic Player that is Attractive??!"	
15898,"Remake the 1997 Shandalaar game. Please don't just copy the Hearthstone model."	
15899,"I cannot wait for the full release. This looks really cool and MTG needed a good online engine."	
15900,"Oh goody cant wait till this gets abandoned like everyone over magic the gathering online game"	
15901,"looks cooll <3"	
15902,"Anyone who plays magic knows wotc is only interested in making profits no matter how much they deny it. Each step they've taken in the last 4+ years prove it. To remaking same cards with new names just so they make cash to switching to substandard card print machines that create misprint so frequently it's affecting every 3rd or 4th box. They'll monetize this game no doubt. It's definitely will not be just f2p, they'll get money from you one way or another. Be warned."	
15903,"I love magic so much.... crazy how much it has evolved since 1993........."	
15904,"They need to reinforce the idea that this is the new and ever improving and expanding digital format for Magic... They have A LOT of cards to go through I would like to see most sets in this game and EDH support. The pricing model needs to be cheap too especially for older stuff. I have spent thousands on cards already."	
15905,"SO its like magic online with cool animations? Is it limited to standard and limited format?"	
15906,"Where the fuck is the FLAVOR TEXT"	
15907,"They need to make tapping rotate the cards by 90°. Its gets confusing, especially when u look at ur opponents board. Right now u might miss untapped cards u would normally notice. If not 90° at least make it clearly visible, 45° at least."	
15908,"I love the idea of banking time during short turns for later on when you need more time for a turn. That seems like a great solution."	
15909,"Oh sweet, Jimmy Wong plays MTG!"	
15910,"Introducting MTG Arena: Hearthstone ripoff 'cause we we're slow and don't know how to innovate!"	
15911,"I think it looks great. I thought Duels was clunky and way too slow, but I'm a bit intimidated by MTGO. This looks like a nice, snappy way to play MTG."	
15912,"We need a new MtG Battlegrounds game"	
15913,"I can't help to wonder if this product will be left to die in 2-3 years like all previous digital efforts they've made (excluding mtgo)"	
15914,"Magic is better than Hearthstone. Magic can't be Hearthstone. Stop."	
15915,"Love the idea but gawd it looks ugly when compared to the previous MGT games."	
15916,"Magic the gathering doesn't need sound efects and flashy animations."	
15917,"These sound effects are terrible. The animations are ten times worse. The cards not tapping is a disaster, it's way easier to absorb the board state by seeing a fully tapped card than it is to check for the tap symbol on each card. The text being completely hidden on each card doesn't actually make for a more streamlined experience, it actually makes it more confusing and time consuming when you need to go hover over several cards when you need to make a decision in game. Playing with square pictures is not more appealing than playing with something that actually looks like a Magic card."	
15918,"Who's leg do I have to hump to get commander into MTG arena"	
15919,"Magic Arena looks to much like heartstone, magic is  mature content game giving a childish look takes me out of the game ... Magic duels look better TBH"	
15920,"GIVE ME A SLICE OF THAT HEARTHSTONE MONEY FOR FUCK SAKE!"	
15921,"Why dont you just make MTGO good? New client, new look etc. MTGO could be superior to Hearthstone, but this Game looks like a shitty clone."	
15922,"I love it  (lit a bit late MTG) :)"	
15923,"looks great. dont listen to the haters. but please make tapping 90 degrees"	
15924,"@Jimmy Wong please tell me Arena will support Commander."	
15925,"Online magic???? Man i gotta get this"	
15926,"ALL AS STANDARD CARDS , it was everything I wanted since the duels"	
15927,"This looks like the other BS Magic games they put out for the Xbox..Why don't they make at MTGO look good!!!"	
15928,"I did it for the chicks."	
15929,"Is Gaby still afraid of trump?"	
15930,"JIMMY NOOO! Say on the light side, stay with commander"	
15931,"she is so incredibly irritating and the game looks horrible."	
15932,"That's so many sound effects. Hope there is a mute option."	
15933,"I'm a Hearthstone player at heart, decided to look up Magic. I was like: Is that Amaz??"	
15934,"The angled view is worse than a top down view.  If your goal is to make assessing the game state easy, top-down is superior.  Magic Online, Hearthstone, and all the major digital card games do top-down views, because they are superior."	
15935,"after what you guys did with duels, I ain't playin nor wasting a dime on your future games."	
15936,"Finaly, should have done a MTG game like this years ago. Now i can stop playing RNGstone and have some quality games."	
15937,"Happy for this :) Glad they have a new engine to look to the future. I'll be waiting for the PS4 release.."	
15938,"What are those colored squares changing appearance all the time? Are they... cards? These visuals really suck, I prefer they kept Duels."	
15939,"Please let us customize how much HS flashiness we need to endure while playing, also a Pandora plugin for actual music, or something similar anyway. Looks kinda neat, but I wouldn't spend $$ on it."	
15940,"i would like this is a joke or a fake...."	
15941,"If I may make one request, give one piece of feedback in an attempt to move WotC away from a direction I fear they may be taking here, it's this: please, do not try to compete with Hearthstone or other born-digital card games in terms of the things they can do in a digital format. That is, leverage what makes Magic different from those games: the depth of gameplay due to extremely limited variance. You guys learned a long time ago that randomness is inversely correlated to strategy level. That's why coin-flip effects are so rare now and library manipulation so valuable. Digital card games use randomness as an inherent part of their mechanics and gameplay, and that is not where Magic should go. I understand that paper Magic is not going away, but my fear is that WotC will use the crutch of a digital format as an excuse (or maybe just a subconscious justification) for reintroducing more variance into the game, knowing that they will be able to translate those mechanics into a digital format. This is the exact opposite of what needs to be done. Digital versions of MtG must be vessels by which to convey the core gameplay to wider audiences, and the focus must still be completely on developing compelling mechanics that work in paper and have low variance. I hate to be so reserved when so little of Magic Arena is known, but screw the voice acting, tap visualization, sound effects, graphics, etc.: this is my primary fear."	
15942,"I don't play Hearthstone especially because I don't like the flary and eye-sore animations. You shut off Duels to copy that? Sorry, but I want to play a game where I can think about my turns without being distracted by too much agitation on the screen.\nAlso, I'd rather you kept the original size of cards with the text, instead of squaring or rounding them."	
15943,"Looks like shit. Magic Duels had a shitty engine but at least it didn't look like it was made for 5 years olds. Is it too hard to make a decent, modern, real MTG game ? We don't want a bad Hearstone copy. Get your shit together."	
15944,"you can play a card without having the mana for it and then unplay it. I thought they dropped that rule after people used it to abuse Lion's Eye Diamond back in the days?"	
15945,"Any one know what sets are going to be available at launch to build your decks from?"	
15946,"Best thing they could do with this is add every pre-construct EDH deck, and add the commander format"	
15947,"i would love to see archenemy"	
15948,"So is this the replacement for MODO? I hope so. I'm not a huge fan of the textless cards cuz I feel like I can't parse the game state especially if I don't know the cards (like when a new set is out :p)\n\nBut Ixalan is looking amazing. Pirates versus Dinosaurs people!"	
15949,"Oh how much I had loved to see this being like Magic Duels but fixed and updated with all the Vintage Sets and formats to play. But no...you had to make it a Hearthston copy... :("	
15950,"Gaby is a Fox.)"	
15951,"Ugh, it sounds like an awful kung fu movie. I can't wait to mute this game"	
15952,"Take my money!"	
15953,"poop card"

15963,"Goodbye RNGSTONES,,, miss the MTG.."	
15964,"Nintendo Switch release pls haha"	
15965,"where to download"	
15966,"ADD COMMANDER!!!"	
15967,"To the people who criticize the 10 degree tap. Back in 1994 we all used to tap like that. The time before vintage had a name. When there was no legacy, extended, modern, commander, pauper or standard... Just Magic.. To me, Arena feels very authentic and in the spirit of the game. I understand new players don't experience this nostalgia, but keep it civil everyone. Provide constructive feedback to the game via the Beta. Trolling doesn't improve the game we all love."	
15968,"Hahaha! A complete and total visual ripoff of Hearthstone. Real creative WotC. I suppose it was only a matter of time. \n\nIs it just me or do some of these sound effects also sound right from HS?"	
15969,"The thing i don't like and i don't know if im just not seeing an enchantment or artifact on the battlefield but at 16:03 Amaz plays his second Card that he did not have mana for, a seven drop when he has 6 mana? and back at 10:31 he drops a 4 drop dinosaur for 3 mana can someone explain?"	
15970,"I love how bubbly  you are! 😍"	
15971,"Louise, I just read your tweet, and although I didn't comment when I first watched this video, I honestly spent the whole time thinking 'wow if I can look this good when I'm pregnant I'll be VERY happy'. \nPeople are pathetic and jealous, just pity them. Because that's what those comments are. Pitiful. \n\nIk it's really hard but PLEEAASE. You're  ALL kinds of goals, beautiful lady! 😍💖"	
15972,"Louise is literally the best mother ever, and this comes from someone with a parent who suffers from alcohol abuse, so watching Louise honestly gives me so much hope I can be like her one day ❤️❤️"	
15973,"F*ck the haters, you're an amazing mum and a beautiful woman! You keep doing you because you're doing incredible! 💛"	
15974,"Louise tweeted that she is struggling with the amount of hate she's received on this video. So can we have a comment thread on the things we love about Louise please?!!"	
15975,"Just catching up with your vlogs... bit behind, forgive me. \nI so look forward to your vlogs everyweek. Please don't let the bastards get you down.\nRemember there is more of us that love you!!! Keep being you  xxxxxxx"	
15976,"This video has been in my watchlist but hadn't been able to watch it yet . However I saw your Twitter and it made me sad that people were sending hateful messages. You keep doing what you're doing Louise , fuck the people who want to spread the hate . We love you ❤️❤️"	
15977,"Just came from your twitter and it made me so sad! So I thought even though this might get lost in the sea of comments I would try to add one more number to the positive comments and say that you are a beautiful woman! In fact in the past few vlogs you've uploaded I have actually thought, Wow Louise's hair has been on point lately. The way it's curled and styled reminds me of those old glamorous hollywood actress. Very classy!  Also that is the cutest yellow raincoat, the color looks great on you. Hope your day gets better :)"	
15978,"Gosh I hope I'm half as good at being a mum and a successful career woman in a few years as Louise is now! A bloody fantastic inspirational lady!"	
15979,"Seemed like such a lovely day 💗💐\nthank you for sharing that louise 😇"	
15980,"Aww lovely video :)) And how snazzy are those trains?!?!"	
15981,"vlogging with big bump, small child and bag- you super woman!!"	
15982,"Your vlogs and happiness bring me so much cheer!"	
15983,"I flipping love Louise, so beautiful and genuine and such an amazing mum. don't let anyone get you down- you're great!"	
15984,"Louise you are absolutely stunning and your figure is gorgeous don't listen to anyone that says otherwise ❤️ I wish I had your confidence 💕"	
15985,"Just looking on Twitter and saw Louise's tweet about the inappropriate and negative comments on this video about her being a single mum. I think it's sick how disrespectful some people can be and I know I respect Louise massively about what she does. My mum is a single mum and I have seen sometimes how hard it can be for her so for people to be so negative to Louise I think is terrible... Ok rant over😌"	
15986,"Im not usually one to comment on videos and I havent had a chance to watch this video yet, saving it for later but i saw your tweets and i just want to say how amazing and inspiring you are, i love love love watching your videos they always cheer me up you are HILARIOUS. Anyone who feels the need to comment negatively on anything is not anyone that you need in your life anyway. Keep doing what ur doing. Love you lots."	
15987,"Hey Louise, I know you probably wont see this comment, however, amidst all the hate and stupid comments you are getting, I would just like to say how well you are doing and what an inspiration you are. It isin't often that people you don't know are able to send positivity into your life without evening realising. Thank you! Thank you for not giving up on all the people who support you."	
15988,"Awesome video . . . . u can go to  http://www.ytboost.info/  to boost your views. Best portal for views."

15991,"You look amazing in this vlog ! I mean you always look amazing but I find you very glowing in this video !! Xx\n\n\n\n (I'm not sure if it's correct because I'm not English 😁)"	
15992,"I think it is nice to see that your bump is growing at that it gets heavier to do normal day activites, it means that the baby is growing and healthy! Don't listen to the haters (although it is hard, I know it is!) everyone is different and goes through pregnancy different, and they probably don't even know what it is like to have a child in their womb! No matter if they do or not, they have no right to complain anyway!"	
15993,"Love Louise so much. I hope I'm half the mum she is one day 💕"	
15994,"This video made me so happy :)"	
15995,"This is so lovely & cute <3"

16380,"we're the justice leauge,we don't quit we win..."	
16381,"Is this the full version? The one in the trailer has a part where he says right now twice, consecutively. It also has that kind of humming guitar sound at the end but for longer and louder rather than only playing in the background and fading out in the end at 2:51\nThe one in the trailer gets really loud and ends with a bang. Any version with that?"

16383,"This film better hit me in the feels like a kryptonite bullet in the heart."	
16384,"They botched up the chorus. It doesn't feel like a strong enough Come Together at all for a song this hype. I tried listening properly but it still feels way too weak compared to the rest of the song."

16470,"Ladies and gentlemen, you may have to adjust the color of your monitors...it is definitely a yellow strap! Haha...I didn't realize it would be so controversial. Pull up the Wiki shot of it and it's pretty obvious.\n(You can also judge based on the brown underpieces that Link wears as a part of that outfit as well, plus the little laces in front at his neck...the hat to me was the most obvious, though)\n\nAlso, just to clarify: A lot of people are saying It's obvious it's Fallen Hero because Link wakes up in a Reincarnation Chamber. Technically, you can't use that as evidence here because the Hero is Defeated division is specifically related to Link losing at the end of Ocarina of Time against Ganon, NOT the battles described in BOTW.\n\nLastly, a lot of people are mentioning the appearance of the Mirror of Twilight in the form of the Fragmented Monument. And that's a really good point, however, if you look at the Fragmented Monument in BOTW, its design is pretty strongly different from the Mirror, in particular the writing in an ancient language around the rim of the circle. \n\nCould the timelines have united and this is at the end of them? That's actually what I was hoping for as I researched! Sadly, I just didn't feel like there was enough evidence to support that. When I stopped to look at all the evidence together as well as how Eiji Aonuma was talking about this game leading up to its launch, it felt like the team INTENDED this to be a return to that first timeline while making nods to the other games."	
16471,"OT has only fresh water Zoras, and since Hyrule is underwater they don't want it to be discovered by Zoras like the sea salt ones in MM. That's why WW has only Rito."	
16472,"What if BOTW is in a timeline where they all start to fuse again?"	
16473,"have you ever tought that the last game could be the continuation of all of them, where somehow the 3 alternate timelines somehow disappeared and the original timeline came back? Idk"	
16474,"I think it would be neat if Breath of the Wild was meant to connect all of the timelines at their ends, it happens so long after all of them and has SOME proof for each one, it wouldn't surprise me if it was meant to be a way to end the three timelines, with every game in the future happening after Botw so we don't have to theorize about which one it falls into anymore"	
16475,"Was anyone else super satisfied that the video was 15:00"	
16476,"Yeah tell me where DOES the Legend of Zelda... XD CD-I games fit in... XD"	
16477,"I love this stuff"	
16478,"Hey MatPat, I just wanted to send a message suggesting a game called La Mulana. It has a great plot based on ancient historical information and I think it'd be a really cool way to tie a lot of games together in an awesome theory. For example: Michael Jackson makes an appearance scrawled on a wall in the ancient ruins of La Mulana meaning that he is among the earlier children birthed by the mother and a separate race from our own. This connection to the real world also adds a cool background to the every game is in every universe theory by making every thing birthed by the Mother or maybe even related to her. Anyway yeah, I think it could make a cool theory and would also be a game you'd enjoy."	
16479,"but MatPat what about the side quest where you have to find the missing pieces of the twilight portal, the bridge where Farosh flies near is the same bridge from Twilight not only that but also why does Zelda know about the Twilight realm. plus you watch Link's coronation in German. with all these evidence it proves that your theory would be wrong and the only real explanation would be a time convergence of some sorts. The creator hints that the game might be in a timeline of it's own or it's CONNECTED to all of the other timelines."	
16480,"I would love to see a star craft 2 theorie about how much time a real minute is in star craft world for example a marine takes 30 secs to build and a battlcruiser 180 so how much dies it really take in the battlefield (sorry for bad english)"	
16481,"Sssshhhhh the CD-I Zeldas do not exist ssshhhhh. xD"	
16482,"Google John Titor: Its cools"	
16483,"Hah! That Steins	gate joke."
16484,"February is spelled wrong ...3:09"	
16485,"rise and shine Mr. Freeman"	
16486,"Hate to break it to you guys but its already been announced zelda BotW takes place after twilight princess and four swords adventures and is indeed part of the child hero of time timeline. Its literally canon yall can look it up"	
16487,"There isn't any concrete proof that this theory is true. I mean sure, there are a lot of subtle hints to patterns, but other than that? There's a lot more proof for it being in the child time line.  The mirror of twilight can be found in the game and even put together. And the line zelda says is still solid post-translation because as you said yourself the sea could mean the sea that was in the lanayru region before the desert was there. There's two pieces of solid proof that it's in the child time line and only subtle hints that it's in the game over or adult time line. \n\nAlso this is unrelated but in Hyrule historia it's stated that the reason the zoras evolved into rito after the great sea appeared was because the gods feared that they would find Hyrule so they forced them to evolve."	
16488,"you forgot that in the failed hero timeline all the links have brown sleeves while in the other two he either has green ones or none"	
16489,"hi matpat i have not really a theory but i thing i found out its a fnaf theory ok the kids birthday party definetly takes place at 1987 because on fnaf 2 the phone guy on night six says that a guy tried to use one of the suits a yellow one then the animetronics started acting strange and there will be one more event b4 fnaf 2 closes down a birthday party make sure you were your uniform hence the guy who gets stuffed into  a golden freddy ssuit in the fnaf place in fnaf 4 hes dressing up and the tv the fnaf 4 kid watches is prob just a re run of the show fredbear and friends thats what i think im prob wrong but yeah dont include my name in a video or anything please dont"

16491,"Each side of the tri force represents a parallel universe. The tri force was broken apart at one point. Thus creating the rift"	
16492,"i didnt like BOTW. im a traditional zelda fan.  orcania, majoras, link to past, link between worlds. etc."	
16493,"Mat pat plz do more fnad there is going to be a fnaf 6 soon!"	
16494,"Isn't spectacle rock also an ester egg? Most locations in BotW are also Easter eggs I think."	
16495,"A lot of YouTuber has disagreed with you they say it's in the child's time line can you explain they pls"	
16496,"The scream painting was hilarious Doing a great job with your videos they're always very interesting"	
16497,"i think its impossable to answer now gut when other games come out you can"	
16498,"I didnt even notice the stripes, i saw the sleeves"	
16499,"There's actually a few other details which are the same, such as the stitches(?) near the top and the brown undershirt for most of the downfall timeline.\nThen again, the divine beasts were each named after OoT's sages, which were only awakened in the adult timeline, and one of the Zora's historical slates specifically states Ruto as one of the sages that helped seal Ganon away. In the child and failure timelines, this never could have come to pass, as each of the sages were, themselves, sealed away."	
16500,"I saw you on a video with a  art youtuber his channel name is draw with jazza i am so happy that it was you"	
16501,"I just noticed that most people's argument is Oh they said 'in the amber lights of twilight' so it must be after Twilight Princess But my counter argument is that, Who said that the twilight realm only existed in twilight princess? With such an advanced kingdom, it should have existed around the same time as four swords."	
16502,"Odyssey in the Mario Timeline"	
16503,"did he win in the new game? or he still lost?\n(Im broke never played the new game) lol"	
16504,"You never told us you were going to melbourne! I am litterally only 2 hours away!"	
16505,"Could've sworn the sea chart on Wind Waker has an island called Spectacle Island, and the we found out later in the game that all the islands are the very tops of h\nHyrule. It could've just been a reference to the games in the failed timeline."	
16506,"To be honest: I liked it better when it was just a legend that was retold again and again and always changed the setting, the details and the overarching ideas, but kept the core intact. You know... like real legends do."	
16507,"I still think the entire concept of trying to attribute a contiguous timeline to a bunch of re-imaginings of the same legend which simply changes over time as the technology with which to tell the story evolves was a mistake, and Skyward Sword was the culmination of that mistake."	
16508,"Mat i saw you in the street art thing!"	
16509,"I still think it's part of child timeline. But I'm not ready to do research to prove it... So I'll let you have this victory"	
16510,"Wouldn't this game come 100years after ocarina of time since other things are still there and he dawns his iconic gear at the end?"	
16511,"Hey Game Theory I was wondering you haven't done a theory on ark survival evolved and there seems to be  alot of secrets, maybe you if you dig deep you could find a really interesting video, maybe people will agree with me?"	
16512,"of course this is the failed hero timeline. it is the only Zelda game where they specifically say link Falls to Gannon"	
16513,"Just a word of wisdom. Remember that Breath of the Wild is a game will with 900 references and very little can actually be taken as concrete evidence since quite literally everything is a nod to any game in the series. While you may have a belief that the game is in one timeline, there is just as much evidence otherwise. Breath of the Wild's timeline placement no matter where you put it, will never be satisfying."	
16514,"this theory could be way more simple, I mean ganon achieved his final form that means link defeated and he is slept for long time and soo that already said that this falls to defeated time line."	
16515,"I love how people keep bringing up the twilight princess statement like the twili realm is only on twilight princess. in twilight princess that realm had been around for quite a long time, it probably was even around sense ocarina of time, so that means it would still be in the other timelines. although yes I am a believer in the combined time line. also impa only shows up after ocarina in the downfall timeline (just saying)"	
16516,"I feel like if her reference to the hero of twilight is a flimsy piece of evidence then a yellow strap on a hat is much flimsier"	
16517,"a man only needs _so_ much stamina guys... or does he?\n*child Zelda winks at the audience while bending over*\n\nstay classy GT."

16520,"Suck it Hero of Time. We all know that the Hero of Legend is better."	
16521,"Correction it's after Twilight or Four Swords....."	
16522,"Great video as always!\nLove those zelda theories!"	
16523,"Matpat bring back the SUPER AMAZING END CARD TOURNAMENT plz"	
16524,"Do another video on for honor with the new characters"	
16525,"So apparently matpatt is a time traveller? 1:25"	
16526,"I just assumed that BotW ties the split back together"	
16527,"Alternate title Game Theory: Where Zelda Breath of the Wild FITS INTO The Zelda Timeline"	
16528,"I'll be able to disprove this theory with just one sentence! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Deku Tree is dead in both the fallen hero and adult link timeline."	
16529,"You have the best Internet Intro"	
16530,"due to the toxicity of the mod you have on the subreddit /r/gametheorists i am as of this moment handing in my theorist badge and no longer part of the theory family"	
16531,"Is it possible that BotW is the first game to try to unify the three timelines?"	
16532,"5:20\nThe Zora were forcibly evolved into the Rito by the Goddesses themselves to make sure they wouldn't discover the underwater Hyrule, jeopardizing the stasis that surrounded it."	
16533,"THE BRIDGE!!!! THE BRIDGE!!! THE FCKIN BRIDGE FROM TWILIGHT PRINCESS!"	
16534,"Maybe the fact that almost everyone disagrees about the color of the cap band (green-yellow-ish discussion) is the clue to proving that all timelines come together in BotW. A yellow-green band, as if the caps from all timelines merged...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe we're all color-blind."	
16535,"Finally, something about BOTW from one of my favorite youtubers!"	
16536,"but in the story of botw it legit tells you that link got beat up and thats why 100 years of resting allows him to come back and finish it...i mean kinda self explanatory but i like that you got hard evidence anyway :D"	
16537,"Game theory here is an idea for a theory, what is monster hunters black blight otherwise known as the frenzy?"	
16538,"If you haven't played BoTW you probably don't have 300 bucks to burn on a switch what you mean is we don't want to pay scalpers 400-500 dollars for a 300 dollar system. The reason most people don't have switched is because they are bought out from stores and price gouged."	
16539,"sellout?"	
16540,"Ao oni"	
16541,"Best Armor in game is the Ancient Armor Matpat it has the highest defense in the game when fully maxed out."	
16542,"I think that Breath of the wild is at the top of the failed hero timeline, the reason why is because of the story they tell in the game, they tell you how calamity Ganon was beaten 10,000 years before and they tel you about the divine beast and all that, but what doesn't makes sense (but I could be work I haven't played the rest of the games) is that link has faced Ganon in his pig demon form before, and the game is only mentions how you tried to beat him then failed then you where put to sleep for 100 years."	
16543,"Looks like I'm really behind... sorry about that..."	
16544,"Why is it that in the adult timeline link looks like a child, and in the child timeline he looks like an adult? Did matpat get them confused, or is that how it's intended?"	
16545,"What if Breath of the Wild was the three timelines coming back together again. And the split in the was only temporary. This could also be related to the games itself because there are a multiple of ways to play through the game, and everyone plays the games differently, but the ending is all the same. Could that be what the timelines are doing? Could it all be one big game that took different paths on how to complete it, but it all came together in the end when Calamity Gabon was introduced. That could also be proved by Breath of the Wild having similarities with all three of the timelines. Ex. The races of the creature being different in different games and timelines, the reference to twilight princess and wind waker series, and the line given before the Gurdo champion was about to shoot Calamity Ganon about her getting revenge for him taking the form of a Gurdo male. I know there is a more examples scattered through the game to back up this theory, but these instances were the first to come to my mind. What do you guys think?"	
16546,"You missed the Arbiter's Ground, the monument in Faron, and the fact that the geography in Breath of the Wild lines up with that in the GameCube and Wii U versions of Twilight Princess.\n\nAlso, not that it matters, but TriForce Heroes is confirmed to take place directly after Link Between Worlds with the same exact Link as the latter mentioned."	
16547,"I was hoping it might merge some of the timelines somehow"	
16548,"Dear Matpat,\nDo a theory on Among the Sleep."	
16549,"According to this theory , the game  that comes before breath of the wild in the story is zelda 2 . And , it's final boss is dark link. Maybe kilton (is this his name? I don't remember) found his clothes and that's how they're there in breath of the wild"	
16550,"Nice touch with the spirit tracks music"	
16551,"You have the best intro"	
16552,"Hey you know the theory that you made  named why five nights at Freddy's will never end. Well when I watched that I thought up my own. Somewhat I thought that maybe as you said psychic friend fredbear is golden Freddy but what you didn't say that I thought is that the crying child survived the bite and is now the night guard and that is why when golden Freddy jumpscares you he says IT'S ME"	
16553,"Failed hero timeline\nInteresting, seeing as how LINK ACTUALLY DIES BEFORE BOTW. ON SCREEN."	
16554,"I get that a lot of people have completed the game by now, but I disagree with showing Ganon's forms from BOTW. I was kept pretty much spoiler free about the Ganon fight, and when I did finally get to it, it was great, but if I watched this video before completing it, I would've been pretty pissed. idk, I guess it's too late to change it now, but this really ticks me off, because I'm sure there's other people like me that would agree."	
16555,"GameTheory: Is Assasin's Creed: Black Flag Historically accurate to its time frame?\nI'm studying about this age of pirates and i wondered if its historically accurate with Spain in the Caribbean and all that"	
16556,"Spectacle Rock is in Wind Waker"	
16557,"Whats the name of that song at 2:00 😍"	
16558,"Do a destiny 2 theory please👍👌"	
16559,"and if you are ... is sonic mania sonic the same classic sonic in sonic generations???"	
16560,"I have not played the game so I'm pretty sure my opinion won't count as much but based from everyone who ever pointed out many things that correlate in all three timelines in BOTW, might it possible that all three timelines merged back into one? Or at least remnants of other the other timelines somehow showing up in a timeline where BOTW takes place. This is my suggestion anyway."	
16561,"Hello Matthew due to the release of Destiny 2 I believe that you should do another Destiny theory, not about the game itself but about one of its characters, Cayde-6. This would be an interesting concept for you to tackle but probably most of the destiny players that watch your videos and myself would like to see your point of veiw on his life and backstory. Good luck MatPat."	
16562,"Did... Did MatPat just make a joke about suggesting he's John Titor? The time traveler?"	
16563,"Hey Matpat! have you considered the item description for the rubber armor? I quote: This armor has built-in electricity resistance thanks to its source material-an ancient marvel called rubber. Such technology does not exist in THIS MODERN AGE. That part sticks out to me. Not only do we not see rubber in any other Zelda games, but we in real life DO have rubber, and it is quite common. Is this implying that they reached a state of technology like ours in real life before experiencing some sort of apocalypse that wiped that away? Please take this into consideration!"	
16564,"John Titor was a very interesting read, thank you for that. video was great too!"	
16565,"I had a really awful day today, stumbled upon this video.\nTHANK YOU GAME THEORY for brightening up my day. \nThis was a pleasure and loads of fun to watch. Got a good laugh out of it, keep doing as you do now. \nAlso thank you for quoting my favorite tv commercial."	
16566,"QUICK! EVERYONE BLOW THEMSELVES UP SO WE CAN PLAY BOTW!"	
16567,"If we're to assume that every link incarnation that sports a hat with a yellow band is in the defeated timeline, does that mean link from the cartoon series is also in that timeline as well?"	
16568,"Speaking of Crash Bandicoot, you have yet to do a theory about it. Perhaps how deadly his Spin, Slide, and Belly Flop attacks are? I reccommend using the cop cars from Crash 3 (N Sane Trilogy version) to determine Crash's canon height."	
16569,"Hey Game Theory,So recently, I was looking at Scott Cawthon's website and (this may outrage you...) but you have to make another FNAF theory. Don't freak out, but when I checked the site, Scott had changed the cover image to Freddy (in the style of the Take Cake to the Children mini game) carrying a cake with a rainbow behind him. After checking g the source code... Some thing creepy happened. The code read: You are crowding us...You can't tell us what to do anymore...We outnumber you...We found a way to eject you...Ha ha! Say goodbye to our friend. Yep! Scott has lost his mind! But when I thought about it, it became more crazy. The last sentence... Say good bye to OUR friend Not your friend, OUR friend. Odd right? Anyway, hope you make a theory about this, and feel free to mention my commentFrom,A fan"

As a fellow writer/poet/lyricist I absolutely love the lyrics. They're very well written. Especially for this being you're first song. I just might buy you're book now. Was debating it for a while but if this is the quality of writing that can be expected, then it's well worth it. Only wish I actually used iTunes so I could support you by buying this song too. Guess I'll just have to spam listen on here or Spotify. :) Keep up the amazing work Gabbie."

16782,"This was amazing"	
16783,"This is FIRE Lolol"	
16784,"Not exactly as catchy as previous ones... :/"	
16785,"Is the new single about callux?😏😏"	
16786,"You are so bad"	
16787,"Here's my theory: What if Ares wanted Diana to get there?  What if he wanted her help, like he said when she was trying to kill him?  That would explain getting there in one day, and how they were lucky enough to get a tugboat!"	
16788,"Magic that's why"	
16789,"how about this lets say that the island is in other dimencion and that steve actually cross through it but naaa i don´t know it´s youst magic by the way im from mexico and inglish isn´t my main language sorry"	
16790,"i couldnt watch the whole movie because it was so bad"	
16791,"the Dark Knight rises was better"	
16792,"I don't understand why two weeks ago Mat was bending over backwards and making outlandish claims to the size of people in Game of Thrones simply to justify the holes in the story. Yet he is dealing with almost the same situation here and he has no issue calling out Zach Snyder and saying its impossible. Where are the preposterous claims this time? Whats the difference? I'm not a fan of either franchise so i have no stake in either theory, it just seems odd to me that he would basically approach the same problem twice in a month and clearly place more effort in filling one hole than the other. I mean people are just twice as big in Game of Thrones come on. It would've made more sense to say that days are longer or their concept of distance is shorter."	
16793,"should've used the invisible plane yo"	
16794,"in the comics Wonder Woman has a invisible plain, even though ancient Greece hadn't those. I'm pretty sure she can have a very fast boat. Come one dude. She has super powers."	
16795,"Poseidon gave them a push. Case solved."	
16796,"The boat is from westeros, isnt that obvious?"	
16797,"Let tell you something it was a secret island and maybe known those greek mythology but maybe they are something near london cuz that islan is secret an maybe noone maybe discoverde that island yet\n\nThanks hope you seedis and i hope i am right"	
16798,"Because they are frikin gods ! They can use magic on boats and other things. You would have been right if they weren't"	
16799,"What if they hitched a ride from another supernatural being, let's say an Atlantean on a different mission, not able to aid them in this adventure."	
16800,"I know this is farfetched and there is no evidence to support it, but could Posidon have helped the out?"	
16801,"It might be that they've already sailed out earlier. Or some kind of tricks."	
16802,"Tug boat fuck no i played enough gta 4 to know how slow tht shit is"	
16803,"another day,another random youtube critic on dc...cmon give it a rest 😕"	
16804,"Woah woah woah you do realize that the boat was probably magic"	
16805,"Dude Alexander was Greek but the empire wasn't and it was called the Macedionian empire and it wasn't Hellenic it was Hellenistic"	
16806,"The boat they took maybe a magical boat."	
16807,"what about poseidon ? he could've some how controlled the water/wind and idk lol"	
16808,"who says the magical amazonian island stays in the same place? it's not uncommon for magical islands that nobody can find to move around in myth"	
16809,"actually the distance is 2352 miles.  and the movies doesnt talk about how long it took .  doesnt say a day doesnt say a year . why becuase it doesnt matter"	
16810,"What if wonder women died while she was sleeping and it was all a dream after on"	
16811,"How old is Diana? Is she a Diana-saur?"	
16812,"Matpat, I just want to say that I think you are a genius. Keep up the good work and just ignore the handful of stupid comments people post."	
16813,"Ok well diana has superpowers i think she used the power that she used while she was fighting with her mothers sister bcs when she used it it pushed her away she can use that with the boat to go faster"	
16814,"How long would they take to get to the allied ships and then from the ship to London?"	
16815,"You really like the word literally..."	
16816,"Idk man maybe it's a magic boat"	
16817,"Everyone is 10x larger in this alternate universe. Solved!"	
16818,"The gods can change geography though"	
16819,"U realize that wonder women was directed by Patty Jenkins"	
16820,"This was the first movie I have seen in decades and I saw it in 3d.It was awesome.😃"	
16821,"Theory About One Punch Man?"	
16822,"(Diana is a Roman goddess, not Greek)"	
16823,"As a total ww1 nerd was disappointed in the ww1ness of it 😐"	
16824,"Or maybe wonder woman like sleeping in the same position"	
16825,"What about any faster boats that do travel across ocean zones? and catching ride = many rides. With a plausibility."	
16826,"this is gold"	
16827,"Mattpatt's hate boner for zack is precious 😂"	
16828,"She a god!!!!!!!!"	
16829,"MattPatt ruins films"	
16830,"Zack directed Wonder Woman?"	
16831,"The movie sucked"	
16832,"My rebuttal... Poseidon."	
16833,"whats ur problem geek, thats a goodmovies"	
16834,"Daian would have help from posiden"	
16835,"if you notice his plane stops as soon as he goes through the invisible barrier which and it showed this happening before now where is there a lot of plane crashes happen as soon as they seem to disappear off the map let me think God Bermuda Triangle"	
16836,"Maybe the gods blessed then by speeding up there boats 🤷🏻‍♂️"	
16837,"Diana is not a Greek goddess. She is the roman version of Artemis. \n\n\nSorry I'm a geek for mythology and had to point that out. Sorry again."	
16838,"Wow this theory was very good except for one small detail so in the start of the film Diana does that crazy magic push thing on her mentor because she was determined to win and at the end of the film she is able to fly so what if during the boat ride Diana unknowingly speed up the boat via air manipulation which could possibly allow them to reach the harbor in time but that's my idea"	
16839,"I'm not going to look any further into the comments but MatPat, rule 1 of the internet	 NEVER, EVER, pick a fight with the internet. Because the internet will ALWAYS tear you apart faster than a school of piranhas."
16840,"The gods helped them"	
16841,"what if it was all a dream"	
16842,"Ok this isnt a hate comment 😂😂 who else thought Wonder Woman was the best movie ever 🌺❤️ but still I fucking love this video 😂"	
16843,"Please do not use the F word Thank you"	
16844,"Ok cool Wonder Woman has a storyline plot hole, but seriously, can we please stop hating on Zack Snyder?"	
16845,"i just assumed that she had the favor of the gods. zeus or poseidon could have done it as they had done similar before."	
16846,"What if Steve landed for gas somewhere, THEN crashed landed? ⛽️⛽️"	
16847,"Get all the hates out😤"	
16848,"There are two theories I got 1. They could have been traveling with different ships and 2. They could have gotten food and water from the ships they travelled because Steve says  we got lucky in traveling many ships I don't know what the things are called so ya"	
16849,"What bugs me the most about this movie (and it's not even the fact that it's similar to Captain America storyline). It  is how they explained humans were created"	
16850,"DIANA IS NOT A GREEK GODDESS!! SHE'S THE ROMAN VERSION OF A GREEK GODDESS!! (sorry I'm a mythology nut)"	
16851,"Well super hero logic ruins this theory so write your script down on a piece of paper ROLL IT UP IN A BALL TURN THAT SON &@$€£ SIDEWAYS AND STICK IT UP YOUR CANDY @$$! IF YAAAA SMELLLL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING!"	
16852,"Can any1 guess what's a zombies favorite weather?\n\nB(rain)-brain :p"	
16853,"why by the way that was a good pun Darkness  Prevails"	
16854,"world war 1 ships were lucky to hit 20 knots. \nHitching any ride with any ship back then just disproves it."	
16855,"Umm... What if the gods blessed the winds to get them there?"	
16856,"Honestly. I'm not the biggest fan. But I'm glad you didn't love the movie as well. Honestly I didn't like it that much. As a wonder woman movie. It's decent. DECENT. O couldn't even finish it. But it was a poor choice for the very first live action Wonder Woman movie. I have an issue with your theory. Themesciran boats are blessed by the gods so they can travel great distances quickly. I believe in another movie they traveled from their island to NYC in a span of a few hours it's literally a miracle. I believe the message was weird though. I mean Wonder Woman does stand for truth because she left to learn the truth of man's world but what you believe? Then anything is true and nothing is false unless you don't believe it? But truth is fact and that will make truth an opinion. I will proceed to why this movie was trash now. \n\n1.) They killed Steve Trevor \n2.) If they were gonna make this movie the way it was they should have changed her outfit. Wonder Woman was dawned with the colours of the American flag because Steve Trevor was an AMERICAN pilot(who had the flag stitched on to his uniform) and Hypolita(Diana's mum) suggested they made her armor in the other nation's colours to show they meant peace. PLUS Amazon's don't wear blue armour. They wear reds and golds and Hypolita as the queen wears royal purples occasionally(she wears white for some reason. A colour of purity which she is not). \n\n2.) Plot. No more. \n\n3.) What even is Aries' look rn... \n\n4.) Completely uninteresting \n5.) Basically my main problem so that they didn't keep it true to Wonder Woman herself. It's why I got mad when she could suddenly fly in the comics. Like amazons are humans gifted with great strength and immortality(as long as they stay on their island and aren't killed). It's why I ranted so much a bit the Germany/Clothed thing. They didn't stay true to her character and that movie was literally most likely the first wonder woman movie a lot of people have seen.. \n\n\n\nAnyhow the animated wonder woman of 2009 is by far superior and the theme suits Diana better than the recent one. Watch that if you want a good ww movie with phenomenal music."	
16857,"What about her lasso they could throw it and pull there way the for more speed because Wonder Woman and more strength than a normal human"	
16858,"When frustrated wannabe-filmmakers reconverted into DISNYDRA fanboys with a payroll need to bash about a movie even Disney and most of its fandom themselves refuses (for strategic reasons starting by not risking to be lynched by their female audiences by example) to diss because that's movie is pinky enough for their tastes"	
16859,"Since this movie acts on the premise that Greek Gods exist, then Poseidon would exist too. He and Ares are not always on the best terms, and this war might not be in his best interest. Since he is one of the most powerful gods, and controls the sea, he could have easily gotten the boat to London overnight. Maybe that's what happened?"	
16860,"11:30 he didn't specify what ship they caught a ride with, they could've been passed like a baton between the allied ships in the Mediterranean."	
16861,"QUICK\nEveryone tweet Zack Snyder pictures of ducks with explosions and sky beams!"	
16862,"Maybe posidon took pity on them and turned the tides in their favor"	
16863,"Diana is the Roman goddess of the moon and the hunt"	
16864,"Sorry MatPat, but this is the best DC film since the Dark Knight Trilogy, and it's a hell of a lot better than any of the cheesy-humored mindless chick flicks that Marvel is spilling out just to get some easy money."	
16865,"But you are forgetting that this movie like you said in the beginning has Greek mythology in it so what if the gods helped her out because of the prophecy and all that she does make it. Ever think of that?"	
16866,"They say they hitched a ride ... I think he meant a bigger powerful boat as a tug boat."	
16867,"She has roots in mythology. Divine Intervention. But hey that's just a theory a FILM THEORY! Thanks for reading! P.S. What happened to your final thoughts?"	
16868,"This is kinda dumb, but what if Poseidon used his GODLY POWERS and gave them a Diana and Steve some help? After all, this is a world with Greek gods."	
16869,"But its a magic Amazon boat so"	
16870,"The only thing WW has going for it, is that it is one of the few DC films (besides Batman) that wasn't total shit. It still doesn't match the great run that Marvel is having at the cinema. When something is new, everyone gets stoked on the novelty, but a few months and a clear head will show. Anyone still think Avatar was a masterpiece?"	
16871,"You forgot about one thing:  *breathes deeply*  MAGIC!"	
16872,"Good theory, but this is my solution to the problem.  Magic"	
16873,"Magic? They did mention that Themyscira was protected by a magical barrier that completely separated them from the mortal realm. Maybe the barrier kept them in a separate dimension so they were able to plop back into normal space near London."	
16874,"5:05 \nWait, Isn’t Diana the roman counterpart of Artemisa, the greek goddess, daughter of Zeus?"	
16875,"You gotta remember that this has gods and mythology. Poseidon could have used his P O W E R S to take them where ever they want since Poseidon hates Hades ALOT."	
16876,"A movie directed by a woman starring a woman is long overdue.\n\nI suspect you might be a liberal."	
16877,"So basically there was a teleported in the middle of the ocean because the amazon place is fake and the teleport was close to london"	
16878,"HAHAHAHAHA guess Zack didn't do his Movie Homework!!! #BURN🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 THE TRUTH HURTS DOESN'T ZACK!!!! 💥 Sorry I mean no harm. I just wanted to say #burn so umm no hard feelings? BUT REALLY you NEED to do your movie homework next time Zack!! 😔😔😔😜😜😜💥💥😜😜💖💜💖💜"	
16879,"5:09 *cough* Roman name Artemis not Greek *Cough*"	
16880,">Magic"	
16881,"How about magic?"	
16882,"Diana is a Roman goddess, *ahem* ayktyually"	
16883,"Plus no blue eyes...wtf Hack Snyder?!"	
16884,"Matpat the Greek Gods helped her Poseidon and Zeus"	
16885,"Did ya know that the first plane ever was created by thr danish man Jacob Ellehammer? Dude! The first NOT mechanical but flying plane was created by him. But the first ideas and drawings of the first plane was drawn by Leonardo da Vinci."	
16886,"Sorry but What about Poseidon"	
16887,"VEGAN FOOD!! Fot the health of our bodies, for compassion and for the planet ::) Thank you"	
16888,"People need to stop being so negative just because she makes plant based food (vegan is a lifestyle not diet). if you want it to be non vegan then just twek the recipes and leave Cassey alone please. It shouldn't be that big of a deal."	
16889,"Love all the recipes, will try them as soon as I get a chance to get some good avocados.  Just tell me how do I make beet hummus as it's not available here and is it ok if I put in Greek yogurt instead of vegan mayo?"	
16890,"Can you please do some Fall recipes? :D Maybe apple cinnamon cookies, pumpkin pasta, and something with butternut squash! Of course, it doesn't have to be those specifically :)"	
16891,"I like ur makeup in this video! So natural n glowing...which just resonated with the clean eating type of glowing!"	
16892,"I love your energy ❤️new sub 😊"	
16893,"The avo fries were oddly amazing... Lol I would totally make again"	
16894,"Pico de gallo is another amazing salsa that goes well with avocado!😍"	
16895,"I need something like this! I love avocado so much! And this is such a life saver for me! I love you by the way"	
16896,"Pleeeeeeaaasse more desserts!!! I always get sad when my family make sugary and unhealthy things that I have to miss out on, it'd be so good to have my own alternate treats"	
16897,"Will you do a video for a healthy peach cobbler?"	
16898,"Since I already have a house I guess I'm allowed to eat avocado toast now! lol jk"	
16899,"I'm trying to eat avocado everyday and it gets boring after a while. Thanks for all these nice ideas. Love ya ♥"	
16900,"ALRIGHT GUYS I FINALLY MANAGED TO EAT ALL FIVE RECIPES AND THEY'RE SO GOOD!!!\n\nI thought the taco looked the coolest but when I actually ate them, the sandwich was my favorite.\n\n(Also is it just me or does Cassey's hair look really good?)"

16984,"THOSE AVOCADO FRIEES!! Genious!! Love these vegan recipees, thanks a lot!!"	
16985,"Hello I was wondering because I was watching some of your old vids and I saw to loose weight u should drink lots of water but you made detoxicating water I was wondering if you can add watermelon to water because I know you can but is it healthy enough because I know they say to put lemon but I would rather have watermelon because it's sweeter and taste better so can someone answer to me and tell me pls?🙃thx😊"	
16986,"please tell me she is vegan now"	
16987,"Love you two. Just so normal! No frills, just yourselves! Xx"	
16988,"Looks like you had an amazing trip Lily! We hope you enjoyed exploring our capital and seeing out summer #TheSwedishWay with Rekorderlig."	
16989,"Awww I love Lily & Anna vlogs..... 53 inch sunglasses 😎 hahahaha"	
16990,"Great vlog. I now want both a Rekorderlig cider and a weekend away in Stockholm (but tricky from Australia though!)"	
16991,"Watching In the gym and burst out laughing at the 53inch thing about the sunglasses lol"	
16992,"Seriously though, you two are just both so down-to-earth and easy to watch. Sometimes when I'm watching youtubers and especially videos where they collaborate, I get the feeling they aren't really that comfortable with eachother. It can feel a bit awkward, a bit like when acquaintances end up having to hang out alone together. You two aren't like that, you seem completely comfortable around eachother and appear to genuinely have fun. Which makes these videos so nice to watch. Maybe it's because you are both individually down-to-earth people. Anyway, so glad I found you both, not sure why it took me so long. (Long comment, sorry)"	
16993,"H&M is swedish, Lily... Yes, it is big there."	
16994,"This was so pleasant to watch, and I have major food envy as I chew on my toast and jam on a saturday evening."	
16995,"Of all the people on YouTube, you make vlogging feel like I'm just watching a best friend. Love your channel."	
16996,"I like because Anna always looks very bored at the airport like myself lol"	
16997,"Serious friendship /girl trip envy! So fun watching you two"	
16998,"Where is ur 1970s jamper is feom please Lily x"	
16999,"Hey girls! First - let me say I really like both of you a lot - you're one of the most genuine nad mature youtubers I know. Just wondering - when you have an opportunity to visit new places like that - aren't you curious about the city itself (history, architecture etc.). I am aware that's a beauty channel and the time you spend there is limited as well. But although I am a foodie and make up/ beauty lover myself I would feel bad not to catch such an opportunity.... Anyway it was nice to see both of you having fun together :)"	
17000,"I really want to go to Stockholm now"	
17001,"Your friendship is just the bee's knees. This week has been stressful and expensive. But I watched this and smiled the entire time. So thanks for that."	
17002,"Love seeing you girls have so much fun!"	
17003,"Adding Stockholm to my travel wishlist. You both seem so sweet and down to earth!"	
17004,"This is one of my favourite videos of yours :)"	
17005,"hey lily :) I need to know whats the song called at the photo museum (betw min 7 and 8). can't find anywhere and it's hard to identify the lyrics. please help! :)\n\nbtw really enjoy your vlogs <3"	
17006,"It feels pretty surreal seeing you and Anna walking on the streets, browsing the shops i'm at so frequently! Wish i had accidentally bumped into you guys whilst you were here! And yeah, Designtorget IS very aesthetically pleasing!"	
17007,"When Lily says the shop is closed, I just want to shout out loud through the screen: It's not, there is a man walking inside~~XDDD"	
17008,"Awww, so sad I was out of town when you and Anna were visiting my hometown! You literally had lunch in the same building my office is in, then brunch where I live...! Good choices anyway, hope you guys enjoyed it!"	
17009,"omg it's olivia lopez (aka @lusttforlife) at 16:14 !!"	
17010,"Excellent vlog Lily!"	
17011,"Lmao lily: I want everything 😂😂😂\n53 inch LOL youre such dorks. Love your friendship 💜"	
17012,"Oh gosh, Monki and Weekday on the same road - the dream!!"	
17013,"Watching this while on a diet was torture!! I'm so hungry now!"	
17014,"Lily!! I took a break from YouTube, so I haven't seen your vlogs lately, and WOW 😳 you have seriously stepped up your editing game!!!"	
17015,"Can't wait for the run up to Christmas this year and here's to hoping you will be doing vlogmas (your way) again! Your vlogs are as always THE BEST!"	
17016,"This didn't show up in my sub. box :("	
17017,"Everyone looks so gorgeous and stylish in Sweden! Always love your travel vlogs, your chill vibes make me want to travel :)"	
17018,"That's not Stockholm!!"	
17019,"Can someone tell me the obsession w this 1970 sweater? I've seen it everywhere, I imagine it is a freebie for bloggers?"	
17020,"I've always wanted to go to Stockholm and this vlog is making me want to hop on a plane right now. Your travel vlogs are the best!"	
17021,"So awesome watching this as I went in January and stayed at the same hotel so interesting seeing you there and in places I went to! Such a beautiful place! I love it so much. Xx"

17024,"Love watching you and Anna together - you just have such a lovely friendship. I miss the podcast!"	
17025,"Can you please do a video on what hair products you use before straightning your hair?"	
17026,"14:32 I looooooove when Anna does that 'I love it' face haha"	
17027,"I LOVE you two ❤️❤️🇫🇷"	
17028,"Wow those glasses in the glasses-shop look amazing 😍😍 do you know if they have a website too?\nEdit: I found them in your infobox 😊 there is a dutch shop called ace and tate which sells quite similar glasses. I got mine from there and I absolutely adore this brand (little recommendation vor Anna 😊"

17031,"How do you manage to eat so much food and stay in shape? 🍟🍕🍔🌭🥞🍦🍩🍪🍰🍹"	
17032,"Do they do the mango lime flavor in the US?? Gotta have pink cider"	
17033,"This is a random question about traveling to other places outside of England: when you go to a restaurant or store and you say hello, what do you do if they don't want to speak English back to you, but they understand English? I try to learn a bit of the local language obvi but I'm always scared they will give me an unnecessarily hard time even though I'm trying to communicate with them as best I can. Do you ever get nervous about that sort of thing?"	
17034,"I dont understand....  which r the pplz,  who dislike yr videos??? Y they press dislike button??  Seriously\nSurly they r the pplz with absolute bad taste"	
17035,"Did you it the sausage? 🤔"	
17036,"I love this video! :*"	
17037,"love your video with Ana !!! so much fun !! <3"	
17038,"LOVED this! Always a fan of your videos and love that your style of videos doesn't change when it's an ad, keep up the awesome work can't wait to see the next one as always! *also love the ad thumbnail 👌🏻*"	
17039,"This was an ad?? I didn't even notice until I saw the comment section.... Great job! I absolutely LOVED watching this... wish ads on TV could be like this, haha 👍😂"	
17040,"LOL even I remembered you had been to Stockholm. :D (Probably cos I Stockholm is like home to me)"	
17041,"Just love how u say Rekorderlig ^^ I didn't understand what u meant before I saw the boxes on the bed."	
17042,"What a lovely girly trip! More of those whenever is possible please!"	
17043,"I just love Stockholm so much"	
17044,"Really loved this! The editing was amazing, especially in the photograph museum 👌🏼 \nlove from Australia"	
17045,"Great video Lily.  This trip with Anna looked like so much fun and really made me laugh. I really want to see you in a pair of 55 sunglasses now! #EltonJohn. Jx"	
17046,"I love you two together ❤️❤️❤️"

17055,"Gee, where does one gets a friend like Anna!"	
17056,"glasses are a little to big you - but you got style!"	
17057,"Yes, one of the things I still can't get used to in Sweden is people eating burgers with cutlery. Weirdest detail."	
17058,"Any more swedes here?? 😃"	
17059,"I am watching your videos for at least 4 years now and I really enjoy watching them. This morning I woke up with kind of a bad mood, but now, after watching your vlog, I feel happy! Keep up with the good work, Lily 🎈 have a great day! Kisses from Germany!"	
17060,"Stockholm is beautiful! My favorite place to see in there is Vasa Museum :) Great vlog, waiting for the next one!"	
17061,"I love those ray bans"	
17062,"Love the new ad disclaimer"	
17063,"Hello! What is the song playing while you were at the museum?"	
17064,"I love the feel of this video, the music really fits !! Thoroughly enjoyed it. Xx"	
17065,"Mmmm really craving a Rekorderlig now....Also, very jealous of the 2 hour flight + different country situation. It's a 2 hour flight + different state here in Australia :P"	
17066,"Stockholm is great, especially in the spring. Scandinavians eat their burgers with a knife and fork. I finally learned to do it that way, to avoid being an American barbarian. 😆"	
17067,"Cannot express how much I've missed your vlogs!"	
17068,"I've been watching YouTube since 2011, I have definitely heard of you but didn't start watching your channel till this year! Love your vlogs❤️😊"	
17069,"So obsessed with that Bella Freud jumper! ❤️"	
17070,"Love the Raybans, tempted to get them for myself!!! :)"	
17071,"What are your topshop boots called cause I've been looking for good black boots! Please do a boot video for autumn and winter! Always love your vlogs! They're so natural and have a good vibe! xx"	
17072,"My favourite youtubers together!!! Amazing"	
17073,"Missed ur vlogs"	
17074,"I love ure vlogs ure amazing!"	
17075,"Bless your friendship! xoxo"	
17076,"so weird seeing you stroll around in my hometown haha! <3"	
17077,"You seem so genuinely happy in this vlog (not saying you aren't happy in your other ones)! Stockholm looks amazing!!"	
17078,"Fantastic vlog - you and Anna always seem to have such a blast. I loved Sweden so much after the first time I visited that I had to learn Swedish - amazing country!"	
17079,"You just took a sped up video of Olivia Lopez (@lustforlife)!!! Yay thank you!!!"	
17080,"Loving this video. I'm visiting Stockholm in April, so madly writing your suggestions down. Might come back and watch this video next year, along with Anna's one, to refresh my memory!"	
17081,"So happy to see a vlog. You were missed!"	
17082,"Now I really NEED to go to Stockholm!"	
17083,"nice soundtrack"	
17084,"I'm going to Stockholm next week this is great! What's the shopping mall you're in?"	
17085,"I always love your vlogs Lily! Always find them so interesting and relaxing at the same time"	
17086,"where is Anna's leather jacket from? it looks  perfect! x"	
17087,"BoJack Horseman is one of the most fascinating characters in all of fiction.  He's pretty much an objectively shitty person, yet we're compelled to root for him because we see something of ourselves in BoJack.  We've all done selfish things, things that we kind of hate ourselves for and we're not sure how to live with those things.  We want to see someone like BoJack be happy and perhaps even redeemed, because it would give the rest of us hope."	
17088,"The thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is - it's NOT an adventure. There is no way to do it so wrong you might die - it's just work. And the bottom line is some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."	
17089,"Wow, and people say that Rick and Morty is nihilistic."	
17090,"Thanks to this show and some traumatizing experiences, I was depressed for around eight months. Throughout that time, I felt as if I related to Bojack, but couldn't give a specific reason of why. This video helps give insight on the qualities I used to, and ultimately do still see in myself. Especially the point about his cyncism reaching the point of a self-destructive loop, and being the root of his suicidal and depressive tendencies. Thank you for the video.. excellent breakdown and analysis, and is personally helpful to me."	
17091,"Fantastic analysis! This is one of the deepest shows to ever hit TV. I can't wait to see what season 4 has in store!"	
17092,"Well, I'm off to cry myself to sleep now."	
17093,"The tragedy of Bojack Horseman isn't that he can't love himself, it's that he thinks love is conditional. This is probably why his so obsessed with fame, because he thinks fame will make him worthy of love. But that's not how it works, if Bojack wants unconditional love then he should unconditionally love himself and the people around him, it may not get him what he wants but it would make a better person... or a better horse."	
17094,"This series is the best, i love when there's an extremely large story within, and even though I cried after most episodes i relate too it too much and cant wait to finnish the story"	
17095,"My life is like Bojack Horseman, as far as wanting change, being aware of my flaws. Yet, something inside is stopping me from making the actual effort to make things better. I only care about music, making music, or creative writing. I'm the same way, repeating the same things everyday expecting different results, expecting things to get better. That's why I love this show."	
17096,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED CHANNELS ON YOUTUBE"	
17097,"Damn this video is gold"	
17098,"This is the cheapest counseling I've ever received"	
17099,"Never seen a single episode and I'm going to start watching it now"	
17100,"One of the best shows out there right now. The protagonist is not even a human and yet he has more resemblance to a human being than most of characcters in other tv shows. Whoever hasn't seen it yet do yourself a favor and watch it now!"	
17101,"One more hour, kids 😖😖"	
17102,"I feel like everything about bojack just got thrown out the window with season 4"	
17103,"I love how your clips actually contribute to your point, rather than just repeat what you just said. Great video🖒"	
17104,"This was exactly what I was thinking as I binged the show in preparation for season 4 lol... amazing video great editing and analysis of the show and the characters within it..."	
17105,"Yo season 4 was pretty great! Depressing, but hopeful!"	
17106,"Fourth season is pure gold"	
17107,"I think Todd was Bojack's Mr. Peanut butter"	
17108,"Considering what happened in the new season, some points made in this video look kinda funny."	
17109,"That princess Carolyn episode in season 4 had me in my feels"	
17110,"Wow! I don't comment very often on videos but this one is on a whole other level. Thank you for doing this. Like many others, sometimes Bojack can be so relatable to me it's scary. Anyway, you got a new subscriber. Great work!"	
17111,"Wow I havent started this show but I am Bojack"	
17112,"A cartoon , Yes a cartoon about a talking horse has one of the most accurate portrayals of depression and self loathing of any show I've seen"	
17113,"Charlotte was never Bojack's girlfriend, she was Herb's girlfriend"	
17114,"Bojack horseman\nWhat is this a cross over episode?!"	
17115,"The background music is very distracting."	
17116,"Lots of things turns around in Season 4."	
17117,"Bravo. This is actually really eye-opening and can be applied in the real world in how we see ourselves and other people."	
17118,"she shows signs of growth grappling with her work and love!\nhe\nhehe\nhehehaha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha- BHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin all seriousness i hope she can recover from season 4"	
17119,"bojack gets plenty of girls. he's just an asshole."	
17120,"Wow really wish you'd have waited and added season 4 to this..."	
17121,"I feel like with addition of season 4 currently, an update video would be very good here"	
17122,"i had never seen bojack from this perspective, good video... why such a generick chanel name tho?"	
17123,"Bojack is a perfect example of Narcissistic Personality Disorder"	
17124,"I don't see how this is going to end well. Anything less than Bojack's complete collapse and/or premature death by suicide or misadventure is going to seem like cop out."	
17125,"Bojack is such an amazing show. Such a grounded human story, which is ironic."	
17126,"I needed this video so much today :( Thank you for the upload- your time, vision, and compassion are all present here :)"	
17127,"Season four continues with this loop,\nBut we look at if he could be happy with family"	
17128,"I wish that I'd dissected Bojack more and that the arc with Anna Spanakopita had occurred earlier. It would have let me identify and let go of my abusive ex-boyfriend a lot faster than I did."	
17129,"It's Mr. Peanutbutter, never write two words."	
17130,"Fuck man....what else is there to say?"	
17131,"This should be HARRY POTTER later in his life. There is no way that he turns out okay"	
17132,"Bojack Horseman is a show to watch late night."	
17133,"So... did someone else had a bit of a internal issue when season 3 ended?"	
17134,"This and Wisecracks video on the show are the best analysis' of BoJack Horseman"	
17135,"About to watch season 4"	
17136,"this is by far my favorite video on Bojack"	
17137,"Jesus christ, this just ripped the bandaid off my old depression scars without warning."	
17138,"Stupid talking horse show make me sad and question my life decision"	
17139,"thanks, i'm gonna go ahead and watch this during the weekend"	
17140,"I'm so excited for the new season! Can't wait to be depressed!"	
17141,"Struck right in the heart."	
17142,"Damn, that's so me."	
17143,"T minus 45 minutes till the season drops. This video only made it better."	
17144,"Great. I'm Bojack. Fuck me."	
17145,"Good video. When it comes to love or happiness, Bojack seeks instant results rather than taking time to adapt. Like getting a soda out of a vending machine."	
17146,"When you binged all of season 4 immediately and now have a deep void inside of you."	
17147,"Wow! I loved how it all held together. Great catches,, great edit, great pace.  This video made the show times better. I never before managed to finish a relatively long analysis of a pop show. And I didn't like bojack that much before."	
17148,"Brilliant analysis of the show."	
17149,"Hands down the best episode to date. You guys keep getting better and better."	
17150,"I love your videos! God damn!"	
17151,"Holy fucking shit, thank you so much for this video."	
17152,"Amazing...Just amazing...my favorite show,now my favorite video"	
17153,"THIS WAS THE BEST ANALYSIS OF BOJACK HORSEMAN I'VE SEEN AND ONE OF THE BEST TV ANALYSES I'VE SEEN ON YT. WELL DONE! You all have outdone yourself on this one."	
17154,"Screenprism. I love your videos! BoJack Horseman is my shit. Could you do one about Crazy Ex Girlfriend, Jessica Jones or Split please."	
17155,"I can't lie guys\nIf they find a way to wrap this all up in the next season or so, whether bojack kills himself or not, this would become the best serial show I've watched since true detective"	
17156,"I have a feeling that his daughter might be the one to deliver the f*ck of the season, I do not want this to happen but I this show has already done this to me many a times before..."	
17157,"You should do a piece on Rick and Morty. Especially with how they approach relationships and the idea of love along with the psychological affects of their adventures, it's just as thought provoking as this show."	
17158,"this was a really well made video it feels like a depressing self help guide aha"	
17159,"If the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again Bojack is insane."	
17160,"The last quote sounds like me, that is for sure"	
17161,"I always love analysis videos on Bojack. I think it's mainly because I look from afar at it sometimes and go, Cartoon horseman is the greatest aching feeling ever. How?"	
17162,"This video, and the show itself, makes me realize how worthless I am. I hate how relatable Bojack is to me. That's not something you want..."	
17163,"Good analysis. I can't wait for tomorrow"	
17164,"It depresses me how much of Bojack I see in myself. But it's also a big reason why I love the show so much. Truly masterful writing."	
17165,"What a fine video analysis, I need more!"	
17166,"I feel like bojack is pretty relatable in some aspects. Notably me wanting to feel loved and wanting to know if someone out there gives a Fuck about me and I constantly worry about if people like me"	
17167,"This is way better then i could ever of possibly imagined."	
17168,"Oh my god, I'm Bojack. Also, this was a really well done and thoughtful analysis."	
17169,"Better HORSE* not man"	
17170,"I'M FUCKING SCREAMING"	
17171,"fuck... bojack is me"	
17172,"doggie doggie what now?"	
17173,"Jesus man... ANDTHING ELSE?!?!"	
17174,"Excellent analysis"	
17175,"BPD"	
17176,"Daammmm, to close to home..."	
17177,"I love BJH series"	
17178,"Good video."	
17179,"I am Bojack I swear"	
17180,"Do one about Mr. Peanutbutter!"	
17181,"........Yep.......Perfect video for Hype."	
17182,"I love this"	
17183,"<3"	
17184,"Beautiful!!"	
17185,"Can anyone tell me if this video contains spoilers for season 4 I am afraid to watch because i can´t seem to find a disclaimer"	
17186,"I don't know if I should return to the show for the next season. I kinda see myself in there and I don't really like it."	
17187,"This sounds like a completely different song and I love it, much respect to the xx for this amazing cover"	
17188,"couldn't have been more perfect"	
17189,"Please cover the entire album. ASAP."	
17190,"These are the lyrics for this lovely cover if anyone wants them!!\n\nIf I wrote you a symphony\nJust to say how much you mean to me\n(What would you do?)\nIf I told you you were beautiful\nWould you date me on the regular?\n(Tell me, would you?)\nWell, baby, I've been around the world\nBut I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)\nThis ring here represents my heart\nBut there's just one thing I need from you\n(Saying I do) \n\nI can see us holdin' hands\nWalkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand\nI can see us on the country side\nSittin' in the grass, layin' side by side\nYou can be my baby\nLet me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me\nAin't gotta do nothin' crazy\nSee, all I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\nAll I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\n\nNow If I wrote you a love note\nAnd made you smile with every word I wrote\n(What would you do?)\nWould that make you wanna change your scene\nAnd wanna be the one on my team?\n(Tell me, would you?)\nSee, what's the point in waitin' anymore\n'Cause boy, I've never been more sure\n(That, baby, it's you)\nThis ring here represents my heart\nAnd everything that you been waitin' for\n\nI can see us holdin' hands\nWalkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand\nI can see us on the country side\nSittin' in the grass, layin' side by side\nYou can be my baby\nLet me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me\nAin't gotta do nothin' crazy\nSee, all I want you to do is be my love\n\nThose flashing lights come from everywhere\nThe way they hit him I just stop and stare\nI'm love stoned and I could swear\nThat he knows\nThink that he knows, oh, oh\n\nAnd now I walk around without a care\nHe's got me hooked\nIt just ain't fair, but I...\nI'm love stoned and I could swear\nThat he knows\nThink that he knows, oh, oh\n \nI think that he knows\n\nAll I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\nAll I want you to do is be my love\nLove\nMy love (love)\nMy love (love)\nAll I want you to do is be my love"	
17191,"im so gay for this 😍"	
17192,"Love how they composed their own Timbaland-sounding beat for the cover. 👌 It sounds like it could be a legit Timbaland/Timberlake production."	
17193,"TOU FRACA"	
17194,"THIS COVER IS SO GOOD!! one of my fav JT's songs ever! <3 i love this!!!"	
17195,"Sooo good!! Great cover! The xx are awesome!!!"

Another movie that goes by this name is a 2017 Egyptian documentary, though I believe this movie would gain traction when it is comes out in theaters, considering it will turned out to be a candidate for the 2017 best foreign film come oscars season. With that been said, I love the trailer. It looks quirky, suspenseful and amazing, all rolled up in one. Looking forward to this."

17521,"I love Annie Clark aka St. Vincent, but this track I'm not feeling at all.  I like the New York track, but this will be the 2nd straight album where there is simply one song that I don't like at all. On St. Vincent it was I prefer your love, and I'm guessing Los Angeles will be the one track I skip on Masseduction. For all her other albums, I genuinely like, and or love all the songs, so maybe this one will grow on me once I hear the album in its entirety.. Either way, I'm just hyped for the new album, and to be seeing her live in Nov!"

17523,"much better single than the 1st one"	
17524,"Listen I love all her albums and I'm sure this one will be good as well...But from what I've heard this is far from her Deepest, Boldest work..\n\nIt seems just to be some good pop...not really much more. I'm not as excited for her new stuff if it's going to all be like this."	
17525,"Digging the artwork....... oh yeah and the music too!"

17527,"This rhythm sounds like another song to me."	
17528,"Ms.Clark killing it as usual"	
17529,"I hope the record contains a hyper-psychotic track. Like how 'Marry Me' had 'Your Lips Are Red', Strange Mercy had 'Northern Lights', 'St Vincent' had 'Bring Me Your Loves'"	
17530,"I could not possibly be more in love with this woman... my gf's love doesn't even compare! 🤣"

17542,"I love this song,St.Vincent is back with a vengeance"	
17543,"I honestly did not like her last self-titled album or her collab with David Byrne, but I'm really digging this a lot. This song especially has a similar kind of groove/spirit that made me love her other albums so much."	
17544,"Idk why but it's got a nine inch nails vibe"	
17545,"Why's this video not available now?"	
17546,"St vincent and grizzly bear are putting out new music what a great ending to this year for music"

17550,"This woman is unstoppable.\nWe are not worthy <3"	
17551,"Annie you are the fucking best."	
17552,"Is that her butt? It might be.  It could be a manican or a drag queen. Or it could be cgi."	
17553,"😻 ur music St Vincent. Maybe someday if your near Disneyland doing a concert I will see you perform live."	
17554,"Shirley Manson feels? Love me some Garbage. You are beautiful Annie. So so so excited for Masseduction!"

17565,"To be honest I came here to talk shit. In the end, I saw a nice ass and heard a good song 😝"	
17566,"Is that St. Vincent's tight little ass on the cover? 😍😙"	
17567,"I was like...I see the hand, but wheres the head, is in that yoga ball / bean chair. /gel looking thing? Then I saw it..... \nNice song though"	
17568,"the next song is probably england is my city"	
17569,"England for next single"	
17570,"I thought the title said official video. I was beyond confused for a while."	
17571,"She's back!!I freaking love this woman"	
17572,"The album art is a mannequin you perverts. Jk... but really, it is."	
17573,"think this is going to be my favourite album from annie so far"	
17574,"Go to the google search and type: WUMO SEO. Its the most reliable Seo firm. They offer you 100% refund guarantee. I vouch for WUMOSEO."	
17575,"Unfortunately, I don't think that is Annie's butt."	
17576,"Way more interesting than New York. The drums, in particular, are great in this. Finally some loud guitar work from Annie!"	
17577,"Where is the electricity? It's not bad, but it's nothing new, especially from her. Hmm."

17583,"now, now"	
17584,"Something about this girl....damn"	
17585,"Does the beginning of this song remind anyone else of Stylo by Gorillaz a little bit?"	
17586,"I like the way she builds the song to the final heartbreaking minute. Brilliant. Beautiful."	
17587,"Dat ass doe."

17610,"Im like the two songs so far... people can you please stop complaining about i miss the old... go back to her old stuff.\nShe have to change and do new stuff."	
17611,"Time to admit she's going full on pop? This sounds like an attempt at chart fodder to me. Ah, for the days of Actor/Strange Mercy."	
17612,"Her earlier album covers were pictures of her head. Now this album is an ass. Really hope it's not an indicator of the direction her music us taking"	
17613,"this will be Annie's worst album"	
17614,"2:25 was awesome, some of her best vocals yet. The rest was just okay"

17628,"i cant feel my face when im with you"	
17629,"I guess this is what happens when you win a Grammy? Happened to Arcade Fire too. You write decent music, focused on the melody, then win a Grammy and get VERY commercial in an extremely generic way. Maybe you get to the top and you just don't care anymore? I know he made 'party' music before, so the dance element isn't so far off, but this just seems so blah and uninspired."	
17630,"I totally relate to the chick with the lamb at 1:57"	
17631,"I really don't mind Beck going with a more Dance vibe for some of this newer material, but his last single Dear Life was making me hope that his new album would go for a more Psychedelic Pop vibe, maybe kinda like an MGMT, Grizzly Bear, Unknown Mortal Orchestra type of thing."	
17632,"Foster the Kids, is that you?"	
17633,"I thought she was grabbing Beck at first"	
17634,"Sorry, but Disco still sucks."	
17635,"Slick as always Beck \\m//"	
17636,"B3CK Stingray just replaced Stylo as my favorite music vid car. Gosh damnit I love beck."	
17637,"Not sure if this is what Beck was going for, but as an alcoholic this hit me in the gut."	
17638,"FU, I know the cost of that cube.   I know the cost of the commercial grammy you aspire unto.    Regardless, I love you."	
17639,"Opinions on whether the scene with the furry at 3:10 is a The Shining reference?\nScene here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmOoekbK6YI"	
17640,"Produced and directed by the country of canada, who chose a weird aspect ratio for some reason. What is that, 14:9?"	
17641,"Let me know who is the girl in that video? Is she the death?"	
17642,"Beck in here https://youtu.be/av0umGH6Mn0"	
17643,"Auh"	
17644,"This reminds me of The Weeknd"	
17645,"I always loved Beck for his edgy, weird lyrics. for his genre-breaking and kind of childish-brilliant use of instruments and sounds. But i feel like these times are over now after hearing his new singles. I appreciate everything he does, but i can't get into this song for example, because its just so normal Pop with yeah blabla Up all night with u-romantic lyrics and so on. Times are changing and i feel like the crazy spirit of Odelay, The Information or Midnite Vultures is forever gone.\n(just my opinion - i'm ok with u guys liking it, i mean it's not a bad song at all)"	
17646,"I'm glad Beck comes around every 5 years or so to drop 2-3 fire tracks then disappear until popular music changes again."	
17647,"i think that the girl is a cocaine line saving to a drunk boy...after that the boy go how we look at the finish"

17677,"I fucking love Beck!! Great single!"	
17678,"I've never heard Beck so blatantly commercial. I actually like it though. He should be a allowed to change like anybody else."	
17679,"Certain points in the song remind me of Justin Timberlake"	
17680,"I can tell this album will be great"

17698,"this mv is so cool"	
17699,"This was published on my birthday and looks so much like my birthday party :P"	
17700,"Wow, this is absolute rubbish......Whats happened to one of the best ?? That is just commercial drivel......'Tell me thats it's nobodys fault, nobodys fault, but.............."	
17701,"Some fans are going to whine about Beck doing a straight pop record. \n\nI'm excited. This is long overdue. Sounds amazing so far."	
17702,"Good song, cool video, but what's up with all those washed out Instagram filter colours in modern music videos?"	
17703,"A girl traversing through a party battlefield filled with everything from booze, drugs, orgies and football players just to save her boy. Then it turns out she isn't a she after all, but rather a bitchin' metallic sports car. One of the most unique music videos produced in ages."	
17704,"I'm so sad I couldn't see him, among other musicians, at the Waterfront Park."	
17705,"Love you Beck, your music experiments changed my life back in the day here is some of my music: https://soundcloud.com/goldenkey"	
17706,"Meh. I think Beck is long past his best."	
17707,"I like this, but it doesn't sound like a Beck track- rather a track by somebody else featuring Beck..."	
17708,"Hmm.  License plate of the car says Canada but looks like the California license plate/font.  What is B3CK saying???"	
17709,"I really like how this new upbeat sound functions both as a feel good bop but also a scream into the void"	
17710,"good song but i couldnt think of anything else than i cant feel my face when im with you.."	
17711,"This is basically Dante's Inferno."	
17712,"Well, it's been a long year waiting for this to come out so I wouldn't have to put FIFA on just to listen to this."	
17713,"So basically, one of the most original musical voices in the last 30 years was forced to pigeonhole his musical stylings into the worst era of music ever just to make payday. Fucking deplorable. There is NOTHING setting this pablum apart from everything else out there right now. Fucking disgusting. Utterly revolting."	
17714,"EA bringed a song from the future"	
17715,"I find it ironic how Beck is presently opening for U2. I'm a massive fan of both, but I find the irony in how paranoidly U2 is obsessed w having a radio hit, so much so that they second-guess themselves to the point where it takes them 3 years to finish an album which they said was complete back in 2014, w the lead single being more in the meh category than the sheer song-craft that they're more than capable of, trying to solve the problem by hiring pop-friendly producers. All the while, Beck writes an amazing song like this (as well as the other singles from his forthcoming, HIGHLY anticipated new album), producing it on his own. Yeah, he delayed its release by a year, but he still did all of the songwriting, as well as the bulk of the instrumentation on his own, on top of the production work.\n\nIn short, if U2 still feel like not returning to the powerhouse duo of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, they should try hiring Beck as their next producer! Or maybe even someone like either Dan Auerbach or Jack White, or even T Bone Burnett!"	
17716,"Beck is a scientologist and therefore an idiot."	
17717,"I'm in love of Beck in every sense, his voice is so.. i don't know how to describe it but it feels like silver gold"	
17718,"No-one else think it sounds like (a albeit better version) of I can't feel my face when I'm with you?"	
17719,"Did you know you have genes named after Sonic the Hedgehog? \nNEW mini-ep over on my Insta: https://www.instagram.com/sci_phile/ \nThanks for watching! -- KH"

17723,"Tails is a boy......"	
17724,"What does the fox say?"	
17725,"please dont write with your right hand (assuming that this isn't a mirror image from the camera) anymore, that was painful to watch lol"	
17726,"If the planet is smaller and gravity is different, wouldn't we need to modify the numbers to match that, and wouldn't the air density be different from ours because the planet is smaller?"	
17727,"So what do u do on the weekend, o ya know just managed to put tails on a scale figured out his weight and solved the probability of him truly flying.\n\nWhat I did ate McDonald's and gamed."	
17728,"How Fast Do Tails’ Tails Gotta Go To Fly? No fast than Sonic's feet. But hey.... That's just a theory! A game theory!"	
17729,"So Tails's ass has exposed bone because with his tails spinning enough they would rip the meat off from around the base of them."	
17730,"Would a fluffy tail rather than a metal rotor blade create more lift or less?"	
17731,"And how fast would he run if he turned the upward motion in direct forward motion like running? Faster then sonic?"	
17732,"he can't rotqte it really if he doesn't have that special joint...but then there are no muscles that would provide rotation...unless he hasn't some kind of mechanics similar to steam engine...\n\nAlso don't forget the spinning is not enough, he has to keep his tail flat and in right angle, like propellers do"	
17733,"come one, decide, miles per second or meter per second, that's confusing!"	
17734,"That necklace makes it look like you survived an autopsy"	
17735,"how many fans would it take to blow away hurricane Irma."	
17736,"I dont have twitter so i cant ask there. I was just thinking. How would laser eyes work?"	
17737,"Could this apply to earthworm Jim's head?"	
17738,"@Nerdist  8:27 - or maybe they aren't suppose to twist, maaybe they're using magnus effect?"	
17739,"Dear sir no calculation is every pointless. Lol keep up the great work."	
17740,"8:23 I was musing that idea the entire video, kinda distracting... disturbing lol"	
17741,"Do a collab with Game Theory!!\n\nLike if u agree"	
17742,"going off what you said about his tails spinning in the spot without twisting up, why do his tails stick out in the same spot while doing a spin dash haha ou would think they would either be curled up with him or spining around his ball body but somehow they come out the back lol"	
17743,"You need to cut the hair cause im paying less attention to the vidoe and just looking at your hair the whole time haha"	
17744,"Could you do an episode about how much force it would take bane to break Batman's spine? I feel like that would be quite a lot of effort."	
17745,"Hey Kyle I was wondering would it be possible for a human to free fall  from an airplane for example and while he is falling to arrange his  arms in such a way that he creates really high RPM and for the final  meters before he hit the ground to arrange his hands again to create  lift or enough air resistance to cancel out the gravity so he ends up  landing with out getting hurt? (Always assuming that he will not pass  out from spinning and he has something of his hands to increase surface  area a bit)"	
17746,"Would luffys gear third actually make him stronger since hes hitting with a larger surface area but equal mass?"	
17747,"The Butter Zone. Lets make that a thing."	
17748,"A helicopter spins a 360 propellor however tails uses 2 tails that would cross over so how does he in fact generate a lift with fur??"	
17749,"So about a month ago I was  playing sonic 2 with my nephew and he started laughing when I told him Tails real name. I asked him, what's so funny? he said  it's Miles prower, get it..... Miles per hour, it's cause he's fast too I literally never put that together and my mind was blown... I know, real late to the show."	
17750,"You kind look like the actor for thor"	
17751,"With KH hair in pig tails, how would the math change? \n(This could be a funny video)"	
17752,"I think you need MatPats pixel measurements for the area of Tails....tails."	
17753,"Can you guys please do a video analyzing how fast sonic is? Maybe even going off of the comic canon or just the games canon"	
17754,"The way tail's tails could spin without twisting is if once they completed half a rotation they flipped across the axis of rotation to their starting point. Impractical, yes, but so is a fox fliying by it's tails. Heck, so is a fox having two tails period."	
17755,"What does your poor tails look like a pig? Poor guy"	
17756,"My brain exploded on the first few equations."	
17757,"There is a cool video on the Gnoggin channel about how tails tails spins like that.\nWorth a watch as a complementary video to this one"	
17758,"Tails' tails couldn't exceed 767 mph +/- as breaking the sound barrier who cause tremendous damage to him. They had this issue when developing the p-51 Mustang. Propellers can only go so fast. Don't think tails can carry sonic"	
17759,"How fast would a human have to run to run across water?"	
17760,"Without the highly unusual axle anatomy, his tails would rotate along their axes as they're spun. The problem is that due to the magnus effect, the resulting lift would actually be in the wrong direction. For him to be able to hover using the magnus effect by spinning his tails, his tails need to be under him, not the other way around."	
17761,"FFFF- WHY HAVE I NEVER NOTICED THAT PUN???!\nMILES PER HOUR\nMILES PROWER\nIT'S SO F***ING OBVIOUS!\nbrb, questioning everything I know"	
17762,"Tails is not equally iconic as Sonic.  Not a Miles-hater, it's just Sonic is significant more iconic."	
17763,"What if his tail rotate opposite to each other kind of like a chinook helicopter? That way they don't twist together, or at least that's how I like to think of it in my head...\nWouldn't a rotation like that give him more uplift or would it be the same since the diameter of each tail would be, what I assume would be, half? So many questions about fictional topics, I'm just gonna stop right here ."	
17764,"I'd watch you on ProjectAlpha but that website runs and looks like it was built by a highschooler."	
17765,"My math teacher is my football coach😂😂"	
17766,"Speaking about the mystery of how Tails' tails can spin the in the first place, have you ever seen this comic strip? http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comic/title-540/"	
17767,"Question: Where does Venom symbiot recede to when it's not present over the body?"	
17768,"so i have a question\nwhen was the last time tails actually used his tails to fly\nexcluding sonic mania, i cant think of many times tails has flew outside of the classic sonic games"	
17769,"How would the Death Star effect the Galaxy it is in? I mean it's basically a new planet"	
17770,"You think Tails weighs 44 pounds? Isn't he supposed to be a red fox with 2 tails? The average weight of an adult red fox is less than 25 pounds."	
17771,"kyle.... addressing the issues that keep me up at night."	
17772,"Don't watch this high. My head hurts lol"	
17773,"I understand why you counted his tails as airfoils, but honestly I was hoping you found/did the math to find that horrible equation."	
17774,"Tail's tails don't twist because they rotate on different orientations to compensate for the torque produced by the rotation of each tail.

If his tail is engineered with that freely rotating tailbone joint then his tails were likely also engineered with that shaped. \n\nThe fur might even help to smooth out the airflow, though it'd be hard to get it into a wing shape at those speeds. Probably has some feather-like hardened fur at the bottom to flatten out the bottom edge. Wouldn't be noticeable when not in use because the fluffiness of his tail hides it."

This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth."

19123,"DNA tests hold as much weight as astrology in science terms. The amount of DNA any individual inherits from relatives just a few steps up their family tree is negligible compared with the vast amount we all share from common ancestors. It means any ancestral history identified by a simple genetic test is just one of dozens of possible interpretations, and to try to trace our lineage directly through our genes is absurd. We are better off conducting our own investigations and creating a family tree to view our history. This kind of DNA testing seems to be heavily promoted at present, but they are fundamentally a scam."

19225,"You ignored Boo Radley. That's why."	
19226,"To be honest all i got out of this vid was a newfound appreciation for paperback books."	
19227,"I disagree. To Kill a Mockingbird was the first book in my 20s. I didn't read in high school and picked up the book while wondering an airport bookstore. Much to my surprise the imagery created in the book got me hooked to reading. I try to read everyday and I'd like to think TKAM had a lot to do with it. Kind of like if you try something for the first time and you like it, you're more likely to do it again. Great story, holds over time. I'll have to read it again to see if the meaning has changed for me."

19229,"the book is NOT overrated."	
19230,"I hated this book. It is overrated."	
19231,"What a cheap stunt by Vox to take an american masterpiece like Mockingbird and call it overrated. My guess is all the people agreeing with the sentiment probably haven't read it since school.

19237,"the book is so popular that i'm pretty sure there is two copies of it in my family house and no one in that house reads, on top of that it was the one school assignment i missed but seen the movie for :D"	
19238,"...600% better than [the books you read zero times]? What's 600% of 0? Smh.. If you read the books proportionately to how good they are then TKAM would have been infinitely better than the others (even at 1 read). Prob should have mixed in an algebra book"	
19239,"So it's so famous bc of paperbacks???!"	
19240,"The movie is quite good. Gregory Peck playing Atticus worked really well, it would be hard to think of a more contemporary actor being suited to that role."	
19241,"Why did they ban this book though"

Like\nOf course ppl liked it it's a gr8 book and the fact that it became so accessible spread it quickly but if it was overrated we wouldn't still be studying it today. Also it's not the books fault u moved so much smh"

19253,"False equivalency.  No one school system made you read it 6 times."	
19254,"I couldn't disagree more. This is trending? Yikes"	
19255,"Yeah, i never *had* to read it for school, but I read it for fun in 5th grade, but I had to read a bunch of other books that perhaps don't have as much social importance/literary quality. So for me, is the book 1000%+ underrated? I'm just saying the logic in the beginning of this video doesn't really make sense."	
19256,"I only read it because I had the chance."	
19257,"And it was certainly not a new theme. A better story was Daniel White, For the Greater Good, by Harlan Ellison. A black kid rapes a white girl, has no remorse, and the black civil rights leaders give him over to a lynch mob to become a martyr for the Greater good of their cause."

19265,"Eh... perhaps Penguim books contributed to part of it's success, but the argument simply doesn't hold water by itself.\nThere are some key factors in To Kill a Mocking Bird that several literary staples and cases of explosive success and endurance also usually have:\n\nA somewhat subversive style for the time. As in, uncommon type of literature that took some by surprise.\nAlso subversive ideas. Exploration of taboo and controversial themes.\nUsually a fresh take on a theme.\nPortrait of a given era that people might not be quite familiar with - microcosm exploration.\nCloseness to the authors' own raw, potential scandalous stories, sometimes drawing controversies after publication, sometimes not so much.\nSimple writting, easy to follow, easy to understand.\nA somewhat realistic style, often coming with a bit of grittiness to it.\nNot following a mainstream or conventional structure - monomyth, clear moral lessons, etc.\n(optional) Realistic and raw coming of age story, reality crash, or a complete change of perspective and opinion. Critical reasoning put to test.\nThe common people in extraordinary circunstances thing.\nAll of those might be realized right after publication, up to years after the author has already died... matter of perception of the time it exploded in popularity.\n\nA whole bunch of literary classics follow some of these, when not all of these. Kerouac's On the Road, Sallinger's Catcher in the Rye, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Palahniuk's Fight Club, Capote's In Cold Blood... to name a few.\n\nSee that I'm not criticising the works for following a certain structure nor trying to diminish the works because they have common characteristics... rather, I love them all and think they deserve the success."	
19266,"Back in the day they really liked to emphasize women's nipples, didn't they?"	
19267,"Thought this book was gonna be about Go Set a Watchman and how that book was the original draft of To Kill A Mockingbird. GSAW takes the story of TKAM and flips it on its head, and it is so very underrated compared to TKAM."	
19268,"fantastic. so ready for more."	
19269,"If you're going to cover an overrated mid-century American paperback ubiquitous in public schools, cover _The Catcher in the Rye_ .\nI mean, it was good, but geez."	
19270,"To be honest I think The Secret Life of Bees was a much better book that touched all the same values. This book just made me cry. Not that TSLOB didn't, but...I found it more relatable and I feel like I really learned something from it."	
19271,"TBH, I'd rather to kill a mockingbird rather than read bless me ultima again for English class"	
19272,"I actually never read how to kill a mocking bird..."

19274,"If you are not hypnotized by the awesome graphics, skip to the reason, somewhere around 3:22."

19280,"I don't get this book. It's not good. Nothing happens. You can literally skip entire chapters and miss nothing. Am i missing something here? Why do people like it? Like not from a business point of view but a critic point of view."	
19281,"American school's favorite liberal white guilt indoctrination tool."	
19282,"Do The Beatles next. If there is any cultural flotsam as egregiously overrated as them I'd be surprised."	
19283,"I like how penguin books had a few years where they just were not loving there logo. Sure they changed it often in general, but 1938 was just: nope, nope, eh... well keep it for four years. And 1948 was just: Good lord! look at that lower body!, and there, that'll do for the rest of the year."

19289,"It's overrated and anvilicious like woah.  But some anvils need to be dropped, and To Kill A Mockingbird still drops that particular anvil pretty damned well."	
19290,"guess im not the only one that thought it was overrated."	
19291,"If your looking for a interesting and (I guess) grounded explanation for how books such as To Kill a Mockingbird become a sensation I recommend the The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell."	
19292,"Never read this in school. Found it at my grandparents house when I was 9. This IS my favorite book. It's well written and takes you to that time and that place like no other story I've read. Sorry, in my mind your just slightly over rated. Like love, it's all in the eyes of the beholder."	
19293,"no... the catcher in the rye is the worst book thought in school"	
19294,"This video explains how it was lucky to get popular, but that doesn't make it overrated"

19655,"Wow, you were forced to watch this rubbish quite closely more than ONCE?!?!?! I admire your strength to endure it!But thanx, all CinemaSins are absolutely guilty pleasures."	
19656,"How did David got his body back?"	
19657,"everything wrong with Shooter would be a good one"	
19658,"The only movie that is worse that this, is sw ep7 poop."	
19659,"You forgot the shitty ass prop guns made from 1980-2017 firearms rather than make something cool, like a precursor to the M41A Pulse Rifle."	
19660,"Ridley Scott is basicly killing his own creation with the Prometheus trilogy! 😫"	
19661,"Good movie ... for a prequel but I'm still waiting for the proper Aliens sequel."	
19662,"Why the fuck would they kill off shaw or better yet, the engineers?! This movie pissed me off more then Wreck it Ralph"	
19663,"Have you guys done anything to commemorate your large numbers of subscribers?"	
19664,"please make a video about Transformers TLK I really wanna know how you think about it"	
19665,"I know the movie has a number of problems, but even as a film major, I can't deny I love this movie. The first in the series since Aliens that I've actually enjoyed"	
19666,"All of this can be reconned away very easily. So I just want to see where Scott is going with this. Guess it's like someone watching a drunk friend trying to do something. I want to see if he pulls this off or fails badly and we all laugh at it."	
19667,"Somehow their ship is a giant bomb that's set off by one misplaced shot, how does a society advanced enough to create warp drive and vehicles capable of interstellar travel through space full of little rocks moving at near light speeds build a ship that will completely explode if it gets hit by one moving a little faster than the speed of sound? *ding*"	
19668,"Hahahahaha the monty python ministry of silly walls skit is gold."

19672,"Dear @CinemaSins... could you, please, do The Crow? Considering what we know, the time that has passed, the dark and tragic circumstances surrounding the movie, and how much we love it. Thank you very much. :)"	
19673,"Where the fuck is guardians 2 bitch"	
19674,"Does anyone else get a feeling of déjà vu when I watch this plus what is with the movie sin counter 2.0"	
19675,"Could you do IT? I can't find the words to express my disappointment with it."	
19676,"CinemaSins, I've got one you can add. In the scene when the crew was walking through the wheat, one of the crew members appears to be eating the wheat. Mind you, not one crew member conducted any kind of analysis before hand to even determine if the wheat was edible and yet, one of them is eating it. I know this is a work of fiction but really?! Another problem I had with this film is its trying to be Event Horizon. If you recall, the crew on that ship were following a beacon signal and not knowing or understanding its origin or who even made it. The rescue team has little to go on and have no idea of the evil they're about to face. Yep, its Event Horizon all over again."	
19677,"Watch me. I'll do the fingering. No thank you. Last time I tried that, I got in trouble with the wife..... I didn't know you were married."	
19678,"Why would they have a gay couple on a colonization mission?"	
19679,"I spit out my iced tea at the Cotton eyed joe joke 😂😂"	
19680,"This was much more enjoyable than the movie itself.  112.\n\nRidley Scott really disappointed me with this entry."	
19681,"Also I think that the ship is meant to do that and the purpose is to wipe out a planet and start again but a side effect is that the black goo creates xenomorphs or something. ( the worms in Prometheus)"	
19682,"Transformers: The Last Knight"	
19683,"that woman who is the captain is a super ugly manboy lesbian twat"	
19684,"And the engineers made the black liquid to destroy mankind on Earth. It shows you in Prometheus"	
19685,"Just waiting for IT ,3,"	
19686,"So sad the fans raged about Prometheus and forced the producers to make an alien movie instead of furthering the engineers etc :("	
19687,"You also forgot the fact that the old robot that tried to replace the new robot couldn't heal but the new robot could so that should've been a giveaway to the crew that it wasn't their robot but the old crazy one they found on the planet"	
19688,"*sigh*\n\nI guess we're stuck with Movie Sin Counter 2.0...\n\nIt's EFFING YELLOW!"	
19689,"As soon as i saw Danny mcbride i knew this was gonna be garbage."	
19690,"I'm just sitting here sad the the xenos died again. Can one live to the end of a movie and not get killed? No, ok. :("

19698,"I wanted this movie to be good, so badly. But no. All the questions from Prometheus left incompletely answered, plus MORE questions. I think Ridley Scott's thesis is that humans are too dumb to live."	
19699,"Can you do: Everything wrong with Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2?"	
19700,"Please do the End of Evangelion."	
19701,"This movie was trash!!"	
19702,"I gotta say, on the food and utilities one, being on a colony ship with 2000 other people, I feel like 9? (I forgot how many of them start off) honestly might be able to live 7 years if they even decided to stay up the entire time"	
19703,"This movie was boring"	
19704,"What Hardcore Henry or IT"	
19705,"Everything wrong with the movie It 1990 please"	
19706,"Just throwing this out there, ofc Walter and David look exactly the same - they're Walter AI'S... they're supposed to look the same."

19709,"PLEASE DO A CINEMASON ON IT"	
19710,"You missed a sin.wait, why do the trucks fall downward after impaling the xenomorph, I'm sure the ship is equiped with gravity generators but There's no gravity beyond the hull in space so how is this achieved? Shouldn't it just kind of float away, like in GravityOh yes Georgey, they float"	
19711,"Why did the engineers not have an armada in space to inspect incoming ships before they come into the atmosphere"

19716,"They should do everything wrong with the original IT. And then do the new one"	
19717,"Basically they sent only the dumbest motherfuckers to colonize a planet"

19749,"Do IT please!"	
19750,"This movie is such garbage. I've seen rape porn that was more gentle than what the 21st century is doing to the alien franchise."	
19751,"Like how these used to like 8 minutes then they discovered ad rev"	
19752,"What's with the Sin Counter 2.0? It's weirding me out. Especially with the yellow. I can't focus on the screen."	
19753,"Do deep blue sea"	
19754,"In addition to all the things you pointed out, the thing that really bugged me in this movie was the preachy in-your-face pro-faith, anti-science theme. In case anyone was as dumb as the crew, they went to the point of stating it explicitly up front (which you sinned). Fine in veggie tales. Annoying in Alien."	
19755,"Angelica's voice is like drugs. It gets me addicted to it so easily and I have to listen to her singing at least 10 times a day now <3"	
19756,"ang galing niya talaga"

19760,"I like her too but Darci deserves to win.. Darci can be a singer, comedian as well as a ventriloquist.."	
19761,"darci cannot do this performance. darci is hiding behind the puppet to look more cooler. Without that puppet, she's really nothing=fact of the matter.\nTake that puppet out and you will see and hear how mediocre and common her voice is. I've seen darci's many performances without puppet and she's not that good.\nAngelica is far more talented than darci in singing talent=fact. ....to be fair"	
19762,"She is going to win."	
19763,"She have nice acent against other little singer."	
19764,"she was good  but im sad that Christian and celine didnt go through they where good too"

19767,"the whole Philippines is proud of you Angelica."	
19768,"Angelica Hale - Her story is AMAZING!  A lot of people say it's the only reason why she is going to win AGT because of her story - My response: YES! Her story has made her the way she is now, her story has given hope for other kids her age to not give up on their dreams even through the toughest situation in life, her story is to show her inner-self confidence & be proud of herself & for making her family proud, people are quick to judge but not seeing the bigger picture, yes everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but let's not put this girl down of following her dreams just because of what other people say or do! We have a lot of keyboard warriors yet they simply can't accept or do what these people have bravely done for themselves to come this far. #WorldPeace #ANGELICA #AGT2017"	
19769,"I'm really proud of you Angelica Hale"

19773,"I still like Mandy Harvey more. She's my million dollar act. Angelica is very talented But I have to give high credit to Mandy because she just brings it home every single time."	
19774,"She's Filipina... Is so easy any song for that country."	
19775,"Takes out that mic filter and then listen to it. But not bad for a ten year old."	
19776,"Always pray for you Angelica good luck."	
19777,"Singers and dancers are a dime a dozen."	
19778,"Hi hi it's ty ty"	
19779,"I'm not the biggest fan of her song choices but she has such an amazing voice, I was so disappointed that Celine Tam didn't make it to the finals"

19842,"Una voce bellissima...  Starei giorno e notte ad ascoltarla!"	
19843,"Her voice is grating. Whether she's 10 or 35, not a pleasure"	
19844,"very pitchy & bad phrasing. Nothing special. nothing new in her singing. same way ended the song with hit common head voice. just like in her previous performance. very predictable. 5/10"	
19845,"One of the worst covers for this song , smh"	
19846,"She is good, but I think the other young girl has way better abilities. This girl just feels more in my opinion."	
19847,"Does she not speak English or have a lisp? Genuinely asking, her pronunciation of words sound funny. Sorry, I've never seen the show"	
19848,"talking about overated."	
19849,"Angel for the final sing and i am telling you the winning piece"

19851,"There's always a Asian better than you"	
19852,"I'm a bit disapointed with her choice of song this time its current but i didn't relate with her emotionally but she's still good ..."	
19853,"She'll be deported before the finals"	
19854,"I hope she doesn't win. Not hating it's just she has an unfair advantage compared to other contestants. People like cute things. People will always vote for cute things even if they do bad. I hope preacher wins!"	
19855,"Nicki's a tired act now. Should've got *Amber Rose.* For just the video I mean. Amber behind the wheel of a slick ride should be the expected sort of scantily clad female eye candy in these sexy types of music videos."	
19856,"Did she name drop Seth rogan as Seth ro?"	
19857,"Hello guys I just wanted to say that I do song covers on my channel, in case you're interested…I'm having some issues right now, but I will get back on track soon, hopefully…Sorry for the self-promotion, when you're a small channel it's pretty hard getting your content out there…Thank you from Italy :) <3"

19859,"Inspiration from Madonna's Die another day? Fergie = musically irrelevant as always."	
19860,"Black latex outfits reminding me a little of the Madonna Human Nature video..."	
19861,"I love Nicki and Fergie, but this song is so cringe, it makes Vanilla Ice look like James Dean."	
19862,"nicki's verse should put in when the song is about to end like 2 verse before so this song is not boring eitherway, well done tho"	
19863,"I'll be honest, though I love both artists, this song has some weird pacing issues and doesn't seem that radio friendly"	
19864,"This song makes me feel like I’m a somebody"	
19865,"Is there a song where nicki is not featuring?"	
19866,"Love it. Fergie gets down like herself. She isn't TRYING TO BE BLACK when she raps. She always had a funky flow."	
19867,"Can I get some likes for no reason"	
19868,"The first few verses sound like Aluna George in you know you like it"

19879,"i came here for Nicki Minaj but second girl is also disaster wow."	
19880,"I see this song in the background of tv commercials like target/jcpenny"	
19881,"Probably the most appropriate thing Nikki has everrr worn 😂"	
19882,"That little pat she did at 1:51 with that face KILLED me"	
19883,"GARBAGE!!!!! another mid 2000 artist that flops nasty....Internet wins again ur industry is dying"	
19884,"does she try to be madonna?"	
19885,"The look at 1:10 is FIRE"	
19886,"who's else there just for Nicki😍😍😍"	
19887,"whos this old bitch ?? she should be retired lmao"	
19888,"Wait nicki Minaj was actually present at the shoot???"	
19889,"uhhhh what's up with songs like look what you made me do swish swish bish and this???  just so quiet?? it's almost just a voice. all it has is a subtle beat. there's no build-up and its just boring imo 😒"	
19890,"Honestly no... if it wasn't for nicki this wouldn't even make it in the radio."	
19891,"Fuck Justin he would not take a pic with a disabeld person"	
19892,"can't believe she's 40 years old"	
19893,"This is actually pretty good"	
19894,"Some women really get super hot in their 40s. I'm pretty damn jealous of her husband...."	
19895,"Surprised the made a vid for this. Tbh. Whiskey"	
19896,"Wow this is so bad"	
19897,"I like fergie, but this song is so boring"	
19898,"These women are straight working🤹‍♀️"	
19899,"Tell me I am not the only one thinking she looks more and more like michelle pfeiffer?"	
19900,"I like this!!! Go Fergie, so much better than MILF loving this jam. 💛😏💛"	
19901,"this is 90's, this is fashion, this is quality...my GOD\n\n a breath of originality . uff FERGIE this IS you \nand Nicki amazing see you dressing"	
19902,"Her voice isn't Auto tuned and it's great"	
19903,"I really hope this song make it into the top 10 😊😊"	
19904,"the most normal 'rap' scene with nicki in a while"	
19905,"Who's here because of Seth Rogens tweet? Lmao"	
19906,"Make sure to  mute the volume from 0:00 to 4:16 to reduce the chances of your ears bleeding"	
19907,"This sounds exactly like 'You Know You Like It' by Dj Snake."	
19908,"Every song Nicki Minaj is in These bitches is my sons"	
19909,"Lyrics from Warm It Up Kane, Set It Off,  and beat by Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock - It Takes Two"	
19910,"It's so bad."	
19911,"Tbh this is too repetitive and boring\nI don't hate Fergie, but in my opinion I don't like this song"	
19912,"I'm here before 1,570,00 views!!! REMEMBER ME!!!"

But today I'm trying it.\n\nBasically I rubbed my half-frozen pork loin with a bunch of things like Cayanne, paprika, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, pepper pepper pepper, brown sugar, and God knows what else. Whatever just smells good together really. Then I took some bacon and I laid it on top and tucked whatever extra length underneath it. Basically I had a lot of pork in my freezer and needed to use it. I poured a can of beer in there and set it to 35 minutes. \n\nI'll let you know the results of how bad I suck at cooking. Right now it just smells good, so I think I'm on the right track. I don't know. It's creaking a lot and popping a bit too."

Most single engine aircraft are 45+ years old. These planes are still safe. Age isnt an issue and as long as they make enough profit to not make that initial cost of buying a new plane, then nothing will or needs to change. Honestly its like channels like this and vox are trying to terrify its viewers"	
20877,"If the near-term prediction is correct, it sounds like more direct flights and fewer connections to catch, especially for people flying to/from smaller cities. Meaning, perhaps, that airports currently relying on their major-airline hub status might start to lose traffic?"	
20878,"I thought 767 is smaller than 787"

20883,"This is so depressing, what ever happened to the need for speed ? All this push for more efficiency but the speed remains a sluggish Mach 0.85 when millions traveled across the Atlantic at supersonic speeds just a few decade ago. The push for a new supersonic commercial aircraft needs to happen sure the fuel costs will be higher per flight but the frequency of flights and the absence for the need for lavish comforts will offset that. To think people thought we all be flying supersonic in the 2000s oh how things turned out..."	
20884,"Here's an idea...\n\nStop cramming the seats so close together that my knees are in my damn chest you fuckers!"	
20885,"Wouldn't electric trains just undercut airplanes for short range in price? I guess to understand that you'd have to understand how trains are profitable. I think that you can't sell the idea that short haul flight saves time over trains when you have to spend more time at the airport just to get on the plane with security checkpoints, boarding 45 minutes before flight, and maybe not so much taxing but it's still a factor. Trains don't have to deal with these things to get from point A to point B. Especially in your example of NY to DC (and that's about the only short haul route in the US where that works because Amtrak at least owns the Northeast Corridor track). In other areas where Amtrak pays for the usage of track on a freight line a short haul flight may be faster."	
20886,"We are almost at 2020 and flights are still 12 hours US to Europe. I think its time to make that the priority along efficiency."	
20887,"But how about the 767?"	
20888,"Airbus actually has an answer A321++. It will be a re-wing stretch out A321. Some call it A322 the wing will be composite and it will stand taller to fit a larger more efficient engine. This plane will be the true 757 replacement since 797 is slightly larger and more comparable to 767."

20899,"@ 3:33,  you say the range of the 757 is 4,000 nautical miles. 4,000 nautical miles = 7408 km	 1 nautical mile = 1.15 miles"
20900,"I expect to eventually see some hybrid/fully electric aircraft developed to manage the majority of short range and economy flights and a return of supersonic aircraft absorbing much of the long distance and business demand"

The 757 had the range, capability and can be extended to fit the needs, the new variant of the 757 would be the 757-300 or 757-200LF (Longer Fuselage)"

20921,"It would be cool so see the A310 being produced again :D HOpefully the time for the a340 will come back too :/ (a340 \o/)  In fact, airbus has some cool updates with their neo concept. I think, that the A321Neo will fill up the 757 gap with the a330neo.  But i think, for getting such an Video, i should ask another youtuber because you seem to be paid by Boeing. \nAs far as i now:\nB737 vs. A320-Family\nB767 vs. A330\nB777 vs. A340 (A340 not to be build anymore)\nB787 vs. A350\nB747 and A380 are the queen and the king of the sky, they don't fight each other^^\nDid i get everything right?"

20954,"The fucking aircraft can reach max speed if it were to except they choose not to because it's more fuel efficient."	
20955,"Electric ...facepalm. There is a reason people don't use electric aircraft. Very, very poor energy per kg means the payload would be increased to the point of insanity. The entire point is to reduce the costs of fuel, electricity still costs money and still produces CO2, usually more cost and CO2 than an efficient combustion or jet engine for that matter. Then the idea of flying with the majority of the aircraft full of huge lithium batteries is, uh, a little dangerous. Currently we already get a reasonable number of lithium battery issues - a small battery setting on fire and burning up. If the aircraft is not only full of massive numbers of lithium batteries but the batteries are forced to be as efficient as possible rather than a big heavy and safe/reliable battery (often lead acid rather than lithium) then we can expect a dramatically increased rate of accidents. Then the biggest danger in aircraft crashes currently is the fuel leaks and fires. With lithium batteries' near certainty to set alight, incredibly high temperature, very rapid reaction, and huge difficulty in putting the fire out we would certainly see a large increase in deaths. And finally electric engines are incredibly poor and inefficient in transonic flight. A slower flight means not only fewer passengers but more aircraft needed to shift the same amount of passengers and thus higher fuel and maintenance costs. In short the concept of electric aircraft to replace anything from the small under-100 seat regional aircraft to the large A380 super jumbos is simply a pipe dream. Electric cars are less efficient than hybrid cars for fuel and CO2 costs, an aircraft with its significant disadvantages beyond increased fuel efficiency... just no."

21252,"WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?"	
21253,"I... have to go and rethink life now."	
21254,"There is no entanglement. Photons just don't experience time so when one filter changes the polarity of the entangled photon, it changes it throughout the entire existence of the photon."	
21255,"Probably missing the point entirely, but what if the blocked sunlight is instead reflected/repolarized, such that some light is passing through at the requisite angle, because it forces it to, so at each filter it's effectively a 45 degree offset instead of a full 90 degree.\n\nAnd since one of the entangled pair is being offset by this smaller amount, it also forces the other to be offset as well.\n\nEDIT: OK, I guess you did mention a hidden variable being influenced by the filter.\n\nLocality I'm willing to say might be upended in certain circumstances. Same with realism. I also have no scientific argument to support my claim. Just one that seems to sound logically sound."	
21256,"I really don't think that this kind of information is suitable for the lay public.\n\nMy education is in economics, so I'm comfortable talking both statistics and (most) other mathematics. But every time I see something about quantum entanglement/the double slit/etc, I just see a series of what I can describe as poorly designed experiments that (appear) to rely on unproven assumptions and build upon them. Clearly, they are not poorly designed	 experts far more educated on the subject matter are doing them. The only thing I've really learned is that I have not been given even the basic information needed to understand let alone make a judgement about it. \n\nIt does make me concerned, especially when the information is given to the scientifically illiterate general public (one glance through this videos comments and you'll run into a deluge of pseudo-scientific babble). The reality is that information given to people without knowledge is dangerous (even if that's only in giving a false sense of understanding). Until the research is more definitive, this information seems to be best kept with the experts, however passionate they may be sharing the information with content creators and the general public."
21257,"how do you measure how much light remains after it passes through the last filter? what if that measurement would also work like a filter, then we also got the human eye that filters and the mind behind it, probably making a big thing out of something not really special or paradoxical at all."	
21258,"Wasn't it proven that there isn't any hidden information/variable?"	
21259,"Hello photons, do you pass through the filter? Yes or no!\n_Something, something, quantum mechanics..._"	
21260,"what is there in protons that is not weird?"	
21261,"People who watched this video might also be interested in following two experiments that relates heavily to this topic:\nQuantum eraser - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment\nDelayed choice quantum eraser - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser\n\nIt would be cool if you could make a video about this or more QM overall."	
21262,"... you spent 14 minutes talking about how it can't work one way. You mention offhand in the middle that that suggests it must work a second way.... And then never mention that second way again. This video would have felt a lot more meaningful if you spent some time talking about other ways it might work instead of only talking about this one way it can't possibly work."	
21263,"Why must the variable be in the photons, and not the lenses?"	
21264,"Would phase change have anything to do with this? Can the filters change the frequency of light, making UV and IR into visible?\n Maybe there's some quantum property that we don't yet know of."	
21265,"Photons\nThe dicks of science"	
21266,"You are trying to make us cry now... \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!"	
21267,"collab from two of my favourite channels!!"	
21268,"I fixed the experiment! 👍\n\nA photon flying through a filter has a chance to pass through it even if it's not quite parallel.\nThis chance falls off exponentially as the difference in angle increases, up to 90° where there is a 0% chance.\n*As the photon passes through it rotates to match the angle of polarisation of the filter.*\n\nI'm sure there's some basic reason why this is wrong, it just seemed like a really obvious solution to me haha. I would really like to know why. 😀"	
21269,"You left out light reflection of the middle lens dumb ass. I own a Orion reflector telescope 10 , so I use filters of many types for many years.  Maybe do a night vision might be helpful here boy."	
21270,"Sounds way blown out of proportion."	
21271,"I freaking hate quantum mechanics. It messes so hard with everything you've ever learned and everything you assume. I feel like Quantum Mechanics is Weird Al Yankovich singing Everything you know is wrong."	
21272,"My head can't handle this 😵"	
21273,"This is a misunderstanding of Bell's theorem, Bell himself said it doesn't prohibit hidden variables, just LOCAL hidden variables... the wave function is global, and perfectly capable of holding values that keep things deterministic rather than probabilistic. So no, the deterministic universe has not been disproven."	
21274,"It was good if you mention that in classical view this effect is not weird at all. http://alienryderflex.com/polarizer/"	
21275,"Sorry, but you have a horrible understanding of entanglement.\nIf you fix your understanding everything will make sense."	
21276,"I bet the numbers change to 100	75
21277,"Why is it that locality is such a hardcore rule!!?? I mean consider quantum mechanical movement like pressure of water jet in a tunnel, a right angle direction change makes a substantial loss of pressure to heat but a directional change less than right angle can re-align the pressure in direction of movement. I mean old toilet pipes were semicircular loop and not perfect right angled to optimize water pressure through suction."	
21278,"The answer is God! Ha! Beat you to it."	
21279,"14 minute physics...\n\nWE HAVE BEEN BLESSED FOLKS!"	
21280,"Theory, the field of passing particles polarize others allowing more to pass"	
21281,"Amazing collaboration!!!! I was absolutely terrified by the initial video clip of the weird Venn diagram but I get it now. This is way fricken cool. So spooky."	
21282,"has it possible that process of passing through the second filter alters the nature of those photons to make them brighter or change how they interact with additional filters?"	
21283,"Time doesn't exist and there is only one photon..."	
21284,"Why talk on hidden variables instead of the paradox? Made the presentation pretty muddled"	
21285,"I thought adding a third linear polarization filter at something other than 90° basically converted a portion of the light polarization to circular. The cosine of the angle of the middle filter then describes the percentage of light that will pass through the the third filter."	
21286,"Does this possibly mean that some of our measurements from distant stars could be wrong?"	
21287,"Tell me the conversation at the end is an excerpt from an upcoming podcast!"	
21288,"The Universe is in the superposition of two states: <realism doesn't work| and <locality doesn't work| 	-)"
21289,"Is this similar to chirality"	
21290,"It's because you're using circles for your diagram."	
21291,"This is sooo wrong.... Same time could be angle of observer to impact results. What would this experiment look if observer rotates?"	
21292,"Just when I thought Ozmoroid a.k.a. Viascience provided me with a sound understanding of quantum mechanics — back to the drawing board. Cheers!"	
21293,"I feel like you made the explanation harder than necessary. Nice vid tho, very good animations."	
21294,"I'd listen to this podcast."	
21295,"LiFi can take advantage of this"	
21296,"Yay quantum physics, those physics always seem to find a way to cheat lol"	
21297,"WHAT IF is does get through but we are the ones who just can't see it"	
21298,"find a few prisms, place them between the filters... IT'S MAGIC"	
21299,"Maybe one of the variables is the human lack of understanding on the world around us still."	
21300,"But this says minute physics and it's 17 minutes long. Fuck that. Ain't nobody got time for 17 minutes of physics!"	
21301,"Oh hey look, it's the theory of everything! https://www.facebook.com/superrelativity/"	
21302,"This seems kinda obvious to me. Light is waves and you are filtering light through slits. There will be interference patterns. You also have to take into consideration how big are the slits. If you filter horizontal reflections, waves won't be perfectly vertical. There will be a little bit of play! That's why when you introduce a third slit in between, the photons that bounced on the edges on the in between slit will have different polarization from the first one, thus it will pass through the third one... That's why when you rotate only 2 filters there is 2 positions that will block the light. But when you have 3 filters there is 4 position that will block the light."	
21303,"Especially loved the conversation at the end, really added to the whole collab and friendly feel to the video!"	
21304,"Then the answer is clear, the photon passes but not seen or change it form from lens to lens."	
21305,"white has all colour, time does not exist, thought effect the quantum"	
21306,"This also works with those polarized 3D glasses from movie theaters"	
21307,"What a long... long...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 Minutes and 34 secs later...\n\n\nLong Minute."	
21308,"You're assuming that the ability to pass through the filters happen simultaneously. Obviously having glasses and having a beard can happen simultaneously, but passing through filters happens chronologically. It can't pass through two at the same time without both filters being the same object. Your analogy is faulty and therefore you can't use the same math to describe both situations"	
21309,"What if entanglement really means that in other dimensions the entangled particles are local, thus speed of  light is not violated."	
21310,"It's because reality is just a projection of two dimensional data at the advancing wave of the original Big Bang."	
21311,"So if we got 90 lenses and rotated each .1 degrees from the last, how much would get through?"

21315,"Only 15% of the information in this video filtered to my brain."	
21316,"The rectiline filters that you are using for this experiment actually influence the light that passes through it! The ¨phenomenon¨ that you are observing actually is explained if the filter being a non matematical object that affects the light that goes through it.This property of matter of messing with light going through it in one direction or another is called birefringence! \nImagine for a second that the filter pivots (absorbs then reemits) the light going through it just a little bit so that it aligns with the axis in wich it let´s the light through. If this is the case it makes sense that the more times you pivot it the more light will pass in the end! \nThis is the concept behind some of your LCD screens! White light is always on behind every single one of the pixels of your screen. Between the front of your screen and the back there is a layer of liquid christals that block that light. When tension is aplied to a pixel little liquid christals allign with it progressively, that is to say that the christals near the back wall of the screen remain in their position and the front ones allign totally with it. Like this :  BACK   _\ |    FRONT \nThis acts like the series of filters now letting through a part of the light wich goes through a clored filter flies through the air and reaches your beatufill eyes you beautifull coment reader you!\nTo be honest I m pretty sure that there are plenty of other experiments that disprove the hidden variables (I could name a few if I tried to remember em) but this one does not ... as you cant truly say that it is the same photon that goes in a filter as the one that comes out. (FYI linear filters like this are made just by having liiitle tiiiiny wires all parallel to one another, wires being great at absorbing electromagnetic energy will only let light through the tiny gaps between them and will spit out some of that energy in the form of light aligned with em ...)"	
21317,"Try this: 1st len 0°, 2nd len 90° with 3rd len 0°on top. The result will be 50% brightness of the original light! Wat?! 😱"	
21318,"Wait	 you said the first experiment without a loophole was in 2015, yet Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982 showing the violation earned him a Nobel prize... So what loophole is there in his experiments?"

21320,"when i was 15 this stuff i can easily understand but lately [23] im getting horrible migrains. is that bad?"	
21321,"I know quantum physic really good. And we used the polarisation filters a lot in school. But we only used two filters and never three. And I think this video tells my why =D I'm going to study this topic a lot more in the future when I'll graduat from university. I love quantum mechanics 🚀"	
21322,"Like minutephysics, have a beard, wear glasses. Checking in."	
21323,"And thats why you look at light as a wave function in this case with filters and it all makes sense."	
21324,"In the 1780s Immanuel Kant presaged quantum weirdness though he didn't know it at the time.  What Kant claimed in Critique of Pure Reason is that reasoning is a faculty of the brain, like digestion is a faculty of the stomach/intestines.  So Kant's claimed that if ever the mind is presented with data it can't physically digest then the data will be forever confusing and unreasonable. \n\nIn the 1780s the scientific revolution was in it's childhood, but at that point it did seem like data+reasoning was absolutely perfect and would never run into trouble. Quantum weirdness, like Bell's Theorem and double-slit experiment, et al, is, me thinks, showing up reasoning as being imperfect. If this imperfection was more widely understood then we might see a reduction in the number of hard materialists with their all is determined world view that leads to fatalism and human conflict."

21329,"I love both of these channels and it was amazing to see this collaboration!"	
21330,"This is probably stupid, but I kept thinking that when the filter is offset by a small degree, some of the light is blocked, but some of the light gets nudged to that offset degree. And the less is the degree difference between two filters, the more likely the light is to be nudged than blocked. So by adding more filters, we creates a smoother transition for the light to turn 45 degrees.\nKinda like a physical object, if launched at a 90 degree turn, it will just ram in to it and stop, but if we add a 45 degree step, it will bounce, and if we keep adding curvature, we reduce the drop in speed. Something like this."	
21331,"I have a question about the experiment:\nFor the filters 1 , 2 and 3 at the time index 1:05. After inserting the 3rd filter between 1 and 2.\nDid you tried to  further rotate the 2nd filter until a point  which perpendicular to the 3rd filter?\nif so What happened to the intensity of the light then? \nI wonder if it becomes dark again. \nIf I find some filters I will try it myself also."

No matter what the WWE do, if the WWE doesn't understand the potential character Enzo brings to the WWE universe, and get like minded guys like him, dishing it out in all weight classes, the WWE is going to stay stagnant forever, and eventually boring.

21730,"Why the fuck is this dumb cunt always trending?!?!"	
21731,"Your HBar routine actually made me tear up 😂😢❤️"	
21732,"Nile, you have a wonderful family!  You are a special young man.  It is great getting to know you from your videos.  Throughout my life, I only watch Olympics and other than that, I am not one to follow sports.  Essentially, I watch only 2-minutes of sports per year is what I tell folks	 as that is the length of the Kentucky Derby, which was started by a distant cousin of mine in 1875 and it is the oldest North American sport.  Getting to see more of the behind-the-scenes watching you and that seriously cute Tom Daley, and the other cute gay man, Steele Johnson, has all been fun.  Until Youtube, we only knew what little we saw about athletes on national TV.\n\nIt is great that you are documenting your career so be able to reflect on it in your future, but also to leave a positive legacy for your family.\n\nHey, your videos could be greatly improved by avoiding having the constant moving of the background where the brighter lights show up.  Always having the lights BEHIND THE CAMERA means that you are better illuminated and your camera has fewer problems trying to deal with that constantly changing background.  A tripod could greatly improve these issues.\n\nGenerally speaking, you need to always have Key (primary lighting on YOU), then a secondary lighting from one or both sides (but the light fixtures are not seen in the view of the camera), then a lower backlighting to dress (illuminate the background).\n\nAs you are using auto focus most of the time, then it is vital you don't have stronger backlights or the audience cannot see you or whatever you try to show.\n\nHaving that natural backlighting becomes too pronounced during segments of the video.  Finding somewhere for the sit-down interview is less upsetting for the audience than having too much swirling of your background scenery.\n\nRespectfully,\nBrennan\nCinematographer/aerial videographer/producer/etc."
