54,"Evan is just taking ur money for granted cause he said if his Rolex had fake diamonds he wouldn't be ur friend anymore and he left when u said the diamond was real, but don't keep commenting it's probably a joke cause ik it might be but my opinion is that he's using Logan's money for granted"

Yeah you're impressing douchey 14 year olds who waste their lives on YouTube but to the real world you and your fucktard brother are nothing more than a pair of over privileged, white privileged toddlers. Grow the fuck up man. You think this will be your life forever. One day you're going to face the real world and realize you can't just jump around and scream your way to a real job. Or you can't hair flip your way out of an inevitable date rape charge."

101,"Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine"	
102,"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist."	
103,"Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you"	
104,"You're telling me that you're not perfect and sometimes you fuck up? \nThat's wired.."	
105,"Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man"	
106,"Never apologise to the regressives"	
107,"dont be sorry pewds, EVERYBODY says something  bad everyday, but your a public person and says this ONE time and get fukin news all over the world talking about it.. jeeezyys, keep on doing what your doing niggah"	
108,"Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration"	
109,"PROCEED WITH CAUTION: \nThis comment section will give you stage 4 cancer immediately."	
110,"this isn't a bad thing... shit happens"	
111,"I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people 😒.\n IF 👏 YOU'RE 👏 WHITE 👏 DONT 👏 TELL 👏 POC 👏 HOW 👏 THEY 👏 SHOULD 👏 FEEL 👏. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled."	
112,"And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful."	
113,"What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you😊❤️"	
114,"OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist."	
115,"pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play."	
116,"I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well"	
117,"Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion, keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller"	
118,"Y'all will forgive him for anything lol"	
119,"i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it.."	
120,"I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!"	
121,"HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES\n\nIF YOU HAVENT MADE THEM, YOU ARENT HUMAN."	
122,"i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word."	
123,"I don't see it as racist, but rather as an accident"	
124,"I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads"	
125,"People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it"	
126,"Its just a word, calm down"	
127,"lets be honest here guys, we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol, we are confronted with the word on tv, music, shows, friends, cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front"	
128,"To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD"	
129,"So humble! It's ok Pewds, u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans."	
130,"👈 watch by clicking here people's are entertaining"	
131,"Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened."	
132,"What did he say??"	
133,"Honestly, who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT, WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/"	
134,"If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period"	
135,"I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill."	
136,"Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me"	
137,"Don't apologize. Political correctness is the newspeak word for leftist censorship.  All these media outlets just trying to bring you down solely because you seem to be somewhat right winged. The fucking Wall Street Journal tried the same thing few months ago and they failed lmao"	
138,"I forgive you but man i can you blame people for saying the n word we say it ourselves"	
139,"Social justice warriors need to chill"	
140,"As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)"	
141,"Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down 😂😂 btw I do like idubbz it was just an example"	
142,"say the N word is not alright at all, but people are overreacting waaaaay too much"	
143,"Idubbbz says niggerfaggot in like every single video a year ago and it's hilarious. Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix"	
144,"If u are really sorry, donate money to africa that you got from making this video."	
145,"Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good, entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke."	
146,"It's okay man👌👌"	
147,"Weird, my thumbs up doesn't stay. Could it be corrupted YouTube again?"	
148,"The day nobody cares about the word is the day it loses its power over people. Don't try to tell me that I'm only saying this because I don't UNDERSTAND. I DO. People have been slaughtered before, Countries have been Defiled AND ENSLAVED.. USED AS PROSTITUTES. NOT ONLY YOU... WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS ARE LETTING THIS N WORD STILL ENSLAVE YOU?"	
149,"Who gives a Shit ."	
150,"THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANES AND YET Y'ALLZ ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOME CRACKA WITH A POTTY MOUTH???\n\nSincerely, your friendly neighborhood Beaner."	
151,"honestly I don't care I won't let the word overpower me, I always will care about you pewdie!"	
152,"say the word cracker.. journos wont care because theres a huge double standard and they hate white people!"	
153,"This guy's face screams 'I'm gonna kill myself'. He seems to have lost all zest for life."	
154,"Blacks folks say that shit with every sentence and when whitey says it on accident without disrespectful thoughts the whole world turns."	
155,"It's ok Felix."	
156,"I think it is okay, you are sorry about that and it is done. Strange is, that we have here 2 kind of people. 1 which can say this word with N and nothing happen und the other people where everybody get insane. Just think of it."	
157,"Power is the disease.  Care is the cure.  Keep caring for yourself and others as best as you can.  This is life."	
158,"20 likes and I’ll eat a pickle"	
159,"How many sorrys can one say and still be able to be a part of YouTube"	
160,"Real life racism in the world<Guy says dum shit on a video game.."	
161,"People in the coments you are stupid hes an adult its not a mastake he should know not to say it stop defending him all the time"	
162,"Y'all are stupid"	
163,"I bet you only 10% of the people getting triggered by him saying the n word are actually black."	
164,"Hey Felix who care? The context is what matters. We know you are not a racist. Don't feed into these stupid narratives."	
165,"Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!"	
166,"Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf"	
167,"I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell."	
168,"Pewdiepie puts up a sorry video for saying the N word.\n\n90% of the comments are people typing it."	
169,"You are basically the face of YouTube. For someone who has woken up from a coma since before YouTube was around you'd be the first thing they'd know about YouTube. I know you have all this pressure under your shoulders because if you say anything wrong, it would be like the YouTube logo walked on stage and said: Fuck off! \n\nIt's hard to control how you are and speak, I know it, and I feel bad for you. You didn't have to apologize, as you said nigger to a yellow fucking blob, but you did."	
170,"All these people that are saying you should say what ever you want are also trump supporters."	
171,"Pewd you don't have anything to apologize for... it's just a word"	
172,"Thank you for apologizing pewds, i haven't lost respect for you"	
173,"Sh*t happens carry on"	
174,"Dude it's just a word. Maybe ppl shouldn't be getting so butt hurt to be honest."	
175,"It's not like he said Voldemort. Ain't no evil wizards gonna come out if you say the n word"	
176,"lol its just a word"	
177,"If a black american says the n word it's called slang. If a black american can call us white people or typical white girls it's called fun. But if a white person says the n word he's a racist. K den"	
178,"People give power to the word they don't want to hear. If someone says the N word, let it slide. Because you're the one who's making it a bigger deal. Stop caring and things will cool off"

Currently loving on my gorgeous s8 plus, HOWEVER, the iPhone X is absolutely beautiful, and for the first time in years I'm actually kind of excited about an apple product. Also can't wait to see how Samsung responds, competition means better products for consumers. Nice work apple:)"

245,"If Apple never named their iPhones with an s and numbered it like Air Jordan shoes every year, the iPhone X would have been released last year. Now after releasing 14 different iPhone models, it's confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9.\n\nThis is what Apple should have done without s naming.. \n\n2007 - iPhone\n2008 - iPhone II instead of 3G\n2009 - iPhone III instead of 3Gs\n2010 - iPhone IV \n2011 - iPhone V instead of 4s\n2012 - iPhone VI instead of 5\n2013 - iPhone VII instead of 5s\n2014 - iPhone VIII instead of 6\n2015 - iPhone IX instead of 6s\n2016 - iPhone X instead of 7\n2017 - iPhone XI instead of 8 & X\n\nOnly the first iPhone and iPhone 4 were named properly. Poor iPhone 9 and 7 doesn't get an s model. Next year, remove the numerics and refer to it only as iPhone the same way the numerics no longer exist for iPads or a MacBook."

257,"apple claims this is the first OLED screen which is good enough for the iPhone..... but it's a lesser screen to the S8 and G6.... and the claim is bullshit, the thing about this good enough stuff is about profit margins...."

You've got a guy over at Environmental Protection who is on the side of the folks continuing to dig the hole deeper.

People will be willing to pay for these devices for years to come, and it all comes from the (non-arguably) brilliant marketing tactics that Apple has been following for years. In the end, none of the debate matters when it's Tim Cook who will be sitting on top of his massive cash pile with the first TRILLION DOLLAR-VALUED company in the world.

And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves. God bless 💕"

It's like your tiny little minds can't stand it when someone entertains millions with a trick. Oh, I saw he had a piece of paper oh, it was forced. Of course it was a force! Who cares!!! He came on national TV, several times now, and was voted through. Just be entertained. Or are your tiny little minds incapable of that?

I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

1324,"Whenever a magician needs to touch something, that's usually where the magic occurs. Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\n\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding. That's usually where the magic happens."	
1325,"I liked the trick. Time for kids to tell me I'm a retarded idiot! If you think your so smart then think about this, this is one guy who is trying to entertain you while being pressured by the millions of people to trick them. It's him vs all of the viewers and anybody with half a brain knows every trick has a reveal but that does not make it bad. Also no your 6 year old son did not solve the trick because you are most likely too young to have one."

1330,"his he predict the end of the word this coming sep.23?"	
1331,"Mel changes her hair like most people change their clothes @_@"	
1332,"Yes his trick is obvious. But me personally. I like his presentation. I like how he always starts the presentation with something random (how did he known howie's passcode?) And then they way he talks and the way he looks and how humble he is. And I also like how he's not a singer. He's such a good presenter that when Heidi and simon new what was going on they didn't buzz probably because they didn't want to spoil it for america right when they are so happy and anticipated. \n\nAlso it's pretty impressive that howie ordered a Ellen Burger and just everything that happened was impressive."	
1333,"This is mind blowing. But we all know a singer or a dancer will win"	
1334,"He should be the winner"	
1335,"THIS MAN IS NOT FROM THIS WORLD DUDE"	
1336,"I know how he did it. When he grabbed the paper that Mel picked he had a little piece of paper in his hand it put it over the paper that was grabbed off the table and just made sure his finger was at the spot when they said stop."	
1337,"I noticed he took the paper with his left hand and then for a split second with his right he put something on the paper. It was a small sticker .notice how he kept his right hand on THE paper the whole time?"	
1338,"this guy is part of the show. hes like a cast. hes not gonna win. Hes just like a filler, to keep the show entertaining."	
1339,"What kind of demon is he"	
1340,"Did no one tell this dude he looks like Hitler"	
1341,"Ok, he sure is very good at messing around with unconcious mind"

1345,"This guy deserves to win. My opinion"	
1346,"is the best M best on this planet"	
1347,"I predict that he will win the show."	
1348,"Simple. Tiny sticker on his finger. He places it when Heidi zeroes in on her chosen area on the card. Look at when its zoomed in. The choices are literally smaller than the size of his fingertip making it easily stickable on the card."	
1349,"Now you see me 3"	
1350,"i think he put a sticker or something on the card that mel chose to make it look like she chose ellen rome cheese and heidi was in on it"	
1351,"The hell happened to Mel's hair"	
1352,"Am i the only one who noticed that he is dressed as Mr. Bean.."	
1353,"He added the sticker after she picked .  also you can see he wouldnt let go of the paper when Heidi was trying to grab it to read."	
1354,"I need this guy in my life"	
1355,"The singers are great the dancers are amazing but this my friends IS TALENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ONE OF A KIND! I am shoook!"	
1356,"SO insane you can see him sticking the tweet on top of another one. Big whoop."	
1357,"Can u guys help me get 200 subscribers I'm so close please I'll be so happy"	
1358,"I would assume this to be some masterful slight of hand where he slipped the paper from a hidden spot is his sleeve then forced to selection of the tweet on Heide. Much better done than the last time where he made a terrible mistake"	
1359,"*I want somebody to explain what he did*\nPeople catch the tricks all time.  I can't on this one."	
1360,"3:05 watch at .5x speed. You can  see he cups the tweet in his hands  and puts it on the paper"	
1361,"It's not about the piece of paper in his hand. It's about how he is able to mentally convince an entire audience that magic is real with a simple trick."	
1362,"Don't bring this guy into the Dunkin' Save again America!!!!!"	
1363,"this guy is a global threat lol"	
1364,"Mell looks like a better looking Elsa.....\n\nFor those of you who don't know who Elsa is, shes my ex-friend....\n\n\n\n\ncold hearted bitch😒"	
1365,"WOW. You guys better give him a 10."	
1366,"I figured it out. At 3:06, after Mel hands him the card, he takes his right hand out of his pocket and puts what I would assume a sticker on there and then forces her to stop on Ellen, Rome, Cheese. Still a fantastic performance!"	
1367,"Alright as much as I hated his last 2 very fake acts this one has be stumped"	
1368,"MAGIC TRICK REVEALED:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe palms a sticker containing the desired tweet Ellen Rome Cheese, then at 3:17 he rubs the sticker on to the card and forces Heidi to read the tweet even though she didn't pick that tweet."	
1369,"This act wasn't that good... To do the trick he had a sticker in his hand and when Heidi said stop he places the sticker on top of the previous tweet so he already knew it was going to be Ellen Rome Cheese"	
1370,"OMG!!! I'm Impressed!!! Now we can believe in Magic XD"

I know what Jon Rettinger is getting... 😉\n\nLess fingerprints will be shown in most indoor lighting.\n\nCan be recognized easily as a X with the vertical camera hump and not be mistaken as a black 7 from afar. \n\nKinda a throwback to the two-toned original iPhone that helped launch their YouTube/tech career.\n\nSilver X it is.  Even my space gray SE isn't consistently all black from front and back and it's the most beautiful iPhone ever made."	
1446,"The last time I was this early the iPhone still had a headphone jack"	
1447,"Wayyyy to expensive, I'm completely neutral to all smartphones but the iPhone X is just a Galaxy S8 that costs $300 dollars more"	
1448,"So no touch id? Wow what a trash a phone"	
1449,"I thought this was a good offering from Apple. It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks."

1477,"Ahh my top all favorites for the iPhone X is the dual 12-megapixel camera, and the placement of the flash was a genius thing. This way the flash is evenly distributed over both cameras.

1497,"Yeah I can’t stand that top bar it’s so goddamn terrible looking!!!!!. For me it’s not about the money price I will be definitely going for the 256 gig. I don’t know if I can leave touch ID. But that top bar I just can’t deal with it watching movies playing games I don’t know what the hell Apple was thinking about leaving the top Bar like that.. And the Face ID I still can’t trust it. There was a video where a guy puts the phone up to an Apple employee’s face and unlocks the phone. Without his permission. So what stop’s the police or anybody trying to Unlock your phone without your permission. I still feel like the face ID has some security flaws.."

1822,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that."

I'm a born n raised Tennessee boy outside of Memphis and even though some parts I lived wasn't country it was still a lot like these lyrics. After my service with the Navy I ended up moving out here to California because of someone I thought was an angel and a friend, still... I do miss a lot in Tennessee and one day I'll come back home.

2711,"I agree 100%, Sheriff Arpaio should not have been pardoned and should have gone to one of his own jails.  \n\nBut where were you, Mr. Oliver, when President Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera?  As bad as Sheriff Arpaio was, and I think his deliberate malfeasance killed people, he wasn't in the same league as Mr. Rivera.  Among other felonies, he was the head bombmaker for a terror group, the FALN, that claimed credit for 120 bomb attacks, killing six and injuring dozens.  There are parallels: as with Sheriff Arpaio, Mr. Rivera was unrepentant and as with President Trump's pardon, President Obama's commutation was popular with a slice of his constituency."	
2712,"Quick fact check....the record for highest temp in AZ is 128 degrees in 1994. Not 145 like in the video."	
2713,"This barely scratches the surface of corruption, cruelty and abuse of his office. I'm surprised Oliver didn't warn about the door left wide open for the Russia investigation. If Arpaio gets an instant pardon for his political and ideological fuckery, anyone who doesn't want to testify in the Russia investigation cannot realistically be threatened with contempt of court and appropriately jailed because Trump will just let them off the hook, which is by definition obstruction of justice	 the exact reason this investigation is taking place."

It's easy to label him a racist when you have the Leftist propaganda machine (in print, tv and cable news) backing you.

And the crowd thought that SOOOOOOOOOOo funny......from there it went dowhill with a speech of hate, rascism and basically the rants and raves heard from Hitler's mouth.....old Joe SHOULD rot/die in jail.....but seems we have to accept he will just rot in hell"

This episode is the best example. You are trying to catch up with events that have been covered extensively already instead of producing original content as usually.

2828,"I can't remember if it was the 90s or early 00s when Bon Bell or how ever its spelled made those slide up lipsticks. Dark grey tube and you slid the little thing up the side and the lid flipped open. I can still smell them lol My first lipstick and it was so much like the color of the one you have on. So now i'm feeling nostalgic and i NEED to know what lip that is so i can get one lol"	
2829,"I think I spied with my eyes, tiny crimped hair on the back of your buns? Am I right Bunny?"	
2830,"I was expecting a little more than whats in there. \nAlso should of had Bon Bons mini nail polish, that resonates more to my 90s child self. lol"

2833,"Wow blast to the past. New Kids on the Block was the first concert I ever went to. Donny's the bad boy. Why do I actually remember so well? I remember because after the concert we went back stage, saw the guys get in their vehicles and started walking. Donny with his convertable full his buddy's offered my friend and I a ride home. He was shocked when I told him no thank you, but what's a 15 year old good girl to say to a car full of guys while her bestie is mute in awe?😇"	
2834,"I would wear my mood ring all the time when I was in middle school. I pulled it out because I wanted to wear it now! Lol!"

2851,"OMG those little hair clips! All the cool girls wore them. We didn't braid, we did little twists and clasped them in a row like a headband. God, the 90's were fun."	
2852,"Most of these things are still available in stores, including caboodles. I mean, the caboodle has facebook and twitter on that card, so it's probably new"	
2853,"I was born in 1991 ☺️"	
2854,"Bunny when you talked about the boy eating the Dr. Pepper Lipsmacker  I had to laugh. It used to be one of my favorite and when my son was really little he would take them and eat them as well, lol! He was actually obsessed with any flavored lip smacker , but it was usually Dr. Pepper. I ended up ordering him the cute little Avon lip balms special for kids and taught him to use them like a big boy and he could carry his own. Lol! Memories!"

2902,"hope you will exist for many years.."	
2903,"Would this song exist if he lived on the first floor?"	
2904,"Masterful video... I'm glad bands sorta feel like they have the proper outlet for making interesting videos again. It didn't make any sense there for a while but thanks to the internet, it's become quite viable and logical again. You can go pretty out there because the only judge is the audience, not some Label executive."	
2905,"For years I've always disliked Radiohead's music. I've always thought it was depressing, droning, never understood what people see in it but.......\n\nI think I get it now. It really makes you think about shit. Absolute geniuses! Fair play"

2919,"Me thinks Thom & Co. watched Marc Isaacs' documentary Lift and mixed it with feelings over the Grenfell Tower fire in West London...Sometimes such pain inspires beautiful art like this."	
2920,"This is so fucking amazing. \nThere are many references to other Radiohead's music videos!"	
2921,"Damn, never knew being stuck in a lift can be such an inspiration."	
2922,"oh wait.. Its not remake of Home Alone, right?"	
2923,"This clip looks like im back in 90s"	
2924,"Radio head has some pretty brilliant music videos and there music is so inspirational"	
2925,"Still the same amazing stuff as always.~!"

2938,"2:52 OMFG IS THE GUY FROM PARANOID ANDROID MUSIC VIDEO!"	
2939,"what the fuck finally radiohead released a good song"	
2940,"Is there a making of somewhere ?"	
2941,"This reminds me of feeling like as a child you never really fit in or were understood, a feeling of being left out in the cold. But then you realize that who you are was really calling for you to get back to your authentic self a coming home of some sort. You see your self fully and realize that you were never really lost. You've come home to yourself, you are now the observer."	
2942,"Idk what's the meaning but it gives me anxiety\nI fucking hate lifts"	
2943,"Wow!! loved it!\ntheres some references some previuos videos like robin *the guy with the purple beanie and the fishbowl*\n from paranoid android\n\npretty radioheadish kind of video \nawesome!"

2994,"Radiohead ha estrenado un nuevo videoclip para su canción “Lift“, uno de los temas inéditos incluidos en el lanzamiento de OKNOTOK, la reedición de Ok Computer por su vigésimo aniversario, que se puso a la venta en junio. Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades."	
2995,"es un video al estilo de Michel Gondry, que raro de Radiohead"	
2996,"Es muy bueno!!!!!!!!! Se pasan !!!!!"	
2997,"Volviendo a los 90's"	
2998,"Italiani dai ci siete ?"	
2999,"Hey I hope you enjoy this new video! Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support."	
3000,"What do the 7s refer to?"	
3001,"As an aircraft tech, Boeing products are superior to Airbus and easier to work on, but as a passenger I much prefer the experience from Airbus."	
3002,"Hydrogen Aircraft and Electric Solar Power. The amount of time the plane sits around is probably more than enough to refuel the aircraft plus the refueling while flying."	
3003,"Lmao what about the bombardier CS300? It's not like it's negligible, 360 of those C Series have been ordered.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CSeries#Orders_and_deliveries"	
3004,"hey friends please subscribe to my channel"	
3005,"I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic"	
3006,"757 is my favourite aircraft to look at! Love that there was a video that focused so long on this somewhat forgotten beauty! (Icelandair flies many of them and connects many cities in North America and Europe via Reykjavik)"	
3007,"So, can someone say.\nBoieng or Airbus type rate? 😅😂😂"	
3008,"Maybe the 797 will come out with a sister plane or just a plane that comes out before/after it maybe another 757"

3010,"I disagree that the B757 is showing age, the 767 flew before it and it's still in high transatlantic use. Plus they're fuel efficient, so there's no need. If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable. We can't drill oil forever, it's not sustainable"	
3011,"Did I just hear Hyperloop? Please head on to Thunderf00t to be reeducated"	
3012,"Hyperloop doesn't work you know that right?"	
3013,"Great and interesting video as normal :)."	
3014,"Erm...just an FYI as someone who lives in Scotland & flys down south to Cardiff and London at least 8 times a year, flying is MUUUUCH cheaper and faster than the train."	
3015,"I'm at the level of procrastination that I'm watching someone rate airplanes"	
3016,"Bombardier C-Series does all of this now and has the orders for them. Guess that's why Boeing is butthurt and putting out these videos."	
3017,"Everyone loves to complain about how uncomfortable planes are getting. Personally, I don't care. I don't ever make trans-continental flights, so sitting in an uncomfortable seat for a few hours isn't that big of a deal. And with the cost of tickets as they are I wouldn't be willing to pay more for a more comfortable experience. It's never been about the journey, just that I get there."	
3018,"Barely any airlines operate the majority of their routes with 787s tho"	
3019,"People are willing to pay more for greater speed or greater comfort... if they can afford it.  Wages have been flat for nearly a generation, so it's no wonder there isn't a huge market demanding supersonic flight.\n\nWhen I went to Hawaii I paid a little extra for a non-stop flight, and I'd have been willing to pay a little extra to make the trip in four hours instead of eight (oh my aching butt!).  But a supersonic flight, even if one had been available (it wasn't), wouldn't have cost *a little extra* but probably would have been *twice* as expensive, and I couldn't afford that.\n\nIf we want supersonic airliners, luxurious airliners, gigantic airliners, we need to get wages up.  If and when there is a market for such things, Boeing and Airbus and others will build them."	
3020,"The problem will be this. Even with this gap filled the concern is accessibility. Because unlike train or car or bus travel you can pretty much just get on and go and not to slog through piles of security theater. So until we realize this i think the other forms will be more dominant."	
3021,"Too much talking while showing clips that have nothing to do with the subject."	
3022,"I believe the 787 was a replacement for the 767 so this would make sense"	
3023,"Could you make a video about the C919, the new Chinese made airplane?"	
3024,"Don't know why some commenters are pissed about Boeing.\nWhat's wrong with that manufacturer?"	
3025,"When will fossil fuels run out? You make it a key part of the argument for electric power aircraft."	
3026,"By the year 2025, Boeing and Airbus will merge and create the Boebus Z5000 which will travel at 5,000 MPH. WIFI will cost $40 per MB and the cabin crew will still be old and/or gay"	
3027,"it way cheaper to fly from London to Edinburgh than use the train already."	
3028,"Correction needed: The Boeing 757-200 has a range of 4500 miles in a 200 seat configuration. The video states a 4000 mile range which is typical for the 757-300, but not for the 757-200."	
3029,"Wanna hear a joke \n\n\n\n\nGalaxy Note8 - (Productivity+S Pen + Android) = iPhone X"	
3030,"Would be interesting to hear your point of view on the МС-21."	
3031,"But, the Airbus A380 goes from Paris to LA nowadays."	
3032,"the plane of the future........ I personally think it will be one where they put you to sleep simply so they can stack you on top of other passengers and pack people up like sardines simply for a larger profit , after all you cant complaint about your flight if you dont remember it right?"	
3033,"Your comments are very American and Wester European centric. The vast majority of future aircraft sales will be mostly in Asia since that's where the largest number of people live. In places like China and India which both have large populations and large surface areas, the more relevant point is one that you briefly touched on, namely the hyper loop. If that technology matures quickly, than it's far more likely that ere will be vast hyper loop networks rather than electric commuter aircraft. Also, why are you comparing aircraft with buses? They are completely on the opposite side of either an economic or technological discussion."	
3034,"I dont know how you made me watch the entire video while the topic is fucking boring as fuck, great job."	
3035,"Boeing boeing boeing...\nWill we ever even hear ONE compliment to airbus rather than praising boeing like a god."	
3036,"There are currently people talking about a possible Airbus A322 which would be a streteched A321 (more seat capacity) combined with an all new wing. This might be Airbus' answer to the MOM problem. The advantage would be a light and relatively cheap plane (compared to twin-aisle) and fleet-commonality with A319, A320 and A321 (minimizing extra-costs of sub-fleets). The disadvantage would be slower (de-)boarding, because of the single aisle and a tube-feel inside."	
3037,"Love the video! I love that you include the metric system things!"	
3038,"As I'm Japanese and living in Tokyo, frequently going to Osaka to see my friend, airplane's cheaper if you book it early. The bullet train doesn't have earlt discounted ticket like most of European countries do. And, the electric airplane sounds great but Tokyo-Osaka (Itami) route, JAL and ANA use B777-200, 300 or 787-9. 777-300 is configurated with about 500 seats. It's not like London Edinburgh. Japanese domestic flights are mostly operated by twin aisle aircrafts, so electric plane is pretty much impossible in capacity way."

3044,"Plane of the future will consist of one pilot and a Dog. The pilot feeds the dog,while the dog will make sure you touch the correct switches. That's automation for you."	
3045,"But why dont they just use the 787 to fill in that spot? Its fuel efficient, and has more seats than a 757."	
3046,"Just got off a 11 hour flight and planes need to get WAY faster... pls"	
3047,"Hyperloops will never be a real threat to planes in the future because we humans are destined to go to space, and between space and the ground there is the atmosphere, aka air, thus airplanes will be much more developped than hyperloops."	
3048,"Bio fuel not electric planes are the future!"	
3049,"besides competition is coming from comac (c919) & bombardier (cs-series) for the reigional market and airbus actually has something to fill in the gap, the a330 (albeit a bit too big) , and the a320 line sort of fit this gap, the range is fine but still shorter than the 757, and the capacity falls a bit short, the neo capacity is even worse\nthe thing about the 757 is that, the range and passenger ratio is just in-line (7000km~ with 220-240 pax), so its hard to replace\npeople might say the 767 is a replacement, the 200 yeah (250-290 pax), but they're also getting old and is still a bit too large, worse - the newer models are even bigger\nalso there is the A350-800 which could be a replacement, but ppl forgot that they can carry up to 440 pax, which in low demand routes doesnt make that much sense.\nso really the airline industry needed a single aisle plane on the 240-260 pax capacity with a range of over 7000km with an impressive fuel efficiency\ngod dammit boeing and airbus, shrink your planes\n\nother consideration is a possible combi type of plane, which 250~ is reserved for pax and the rest is for cargo, i mean that, on high demand times, could generate money, both from cargo and pax and thats a win-win in my eye\n\n\nidk why but everytime even on a supposedly non bias video there is a bias from the outside perspective of\nif it aint boeing i ain going"	
3050,"Electric planes?!? I believe biofuels are more likely. Not only does the technology exist, when fuel prices go up it will be able to compete with the cost. As biofuels become more used they will also drop in price. Battery technology isn't advanced enough."	
3051,"Actually, flying from Edinburgh to London is cheaper than the train (which are horrifically expensive in the UK now) - but people don't fly because the train can be quicker once you factor in airport security, waiting, etc and the fact that both airports are well outside their respective cities. People who fly tend to either be connecting in Heathrow, or live / work nearby. Working on the train is also more comfortable (a table the laptop fits on, power, wifi, decent coffee, etc for the entire journey)."	
3052,"Plane of the future is No plane. This is like 100 years ago somebody predicting bullockcart of the future."	
3053,"why no ads on the video?"	
3054,"Sure, planes are faster than trains - if you don't count the hour you have to be there before take-off and the travel time to the airport, which is usually out of the way and probably not even in your city (plus transit to your final destination)…\n\nFor travelling from western Germany to the south it takes me a total of ~4-4.5h total travel time when using the plane and 4-5h when using the train. When taking into account that the train is _considerably_ more comfortable (more leg room, free to walk around at all times, no changing transportation three times, no long waits, ) I just don't see air travel ever beating the rail unless it gets considerably cheaper (which probably won't happen, since any advantage in electric transport that improves ticket prices for planes is bound to also improve them for trains )."	
3055,"I'm surprised they still haven't utilized birdlike designs into their planes. Why constantly blast your engines for the entire duration of the flight when you can glide on flexible wings in between sustained bursts of propulsion?"	
3056,"They can't do super sonic because it damages the atmosphere"	
3057,"No matter how good it is, people in the United States still have to spend more than hours in the airport at security checkpoint."	
3058,"Hyperloop will never be a thing."	
3059,"Given the rising favour of electric powered transport compaired to combustion, there will have to be either a way to provide much more electricity than there is right now, or an extreme efficiency increase for electric, which at our state are both pretty unlikely. The UK is using about 90% of its electricity reserve and further strain will be put on it with just the electric car, so it makes you wonder if the future will be able to not run out of energy as it unfolds"	
3060,"I note this trend of planes spending so much time in the air that the _passengers_ are becoming increasingly interested in sleep.  Not the _crew	_ the _passengers._  I understand that planes are equipped to provide for the sleep needs of the pilot, the copilot, the navigator and the flight attendants, but what research is being done into providing for the sleep needs of _passengers?_  If we have a plane that is going to be in the air so long that there is no realistic way to ask a passenger to remain seated for the duration, and instead, it's more practical to provide them with _beds,_ can we foresee a day when this is a practical reality?"
3061,"I highly doubt electrification is achievable for flight (at anything past prototype) and even if it was it's doubtful it would be cheaper than avgas. Fossil fuels and nuclear power are the cheapest forms of dispatchable power we have. \n\nThat said, with a large nuclear power fleet, we can create synthgas from seawater, the US Navy research labs have already proven this technology (think refueling planes on an aircraft carrier). Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one. If oil price goes up synthgas will be able to make serious money with an installed fleet so large that it's not going anywhere fast."

3065,"British Airways operate the A319, A320, A321 and 767 from Edinburgh to London"	
3066,"Algae Biofuels can fully replace fossil fuels. Unless there's dramatic new battery technology I don't see the feasibility of electric only airplanes. Both the energy density and charging times would have to be exponentially increased."	
3067,"The energy density of jet fuel compared to batteries is around 100:1.  Until battery technology improves, this will be the major roadblock for large electric airplanes.  Lilium has a concept that might work for transporting people for shorter ranges."	
3068,"Some say that the planes of the future will already have skyscrapers attached..."	
3069,"I have a couple issues with this video.\nThe question is not how much oil we have left but how much of it we may still burn.\nIf we keep drilling for and burning fossile oil at the same rate right now it will very soon let the effects of it, specifically global warming exponentionally worsen. It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can’t ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least “green” energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don’t become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don’t think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later."

And that the place for technocratically sound, more pragmatic policy is in the legislative process? -- American politics centers on emotion, on charisma, on sensationalism. But it shouldn't. Voters shouldn't care about the color of a politician's toupee or pantsuit. What matters is process and, even more so, results, and the person (or, rather, team of people) managing that political process shouldn't be determined by a popularity contest.

Being able to reflect on that experience, mistakes and all - and learn from it is pretty important for anyone to be able to do. You won't get far in life if you can't do this. But slather this with kneejerk hatred and it suddenly becomes entirely a blame game! \n\nI mean, it takes a deep plunge into the the pit of 'alternative facts' to be able to watch this interview and come away with the conclusion that Hillary is simply doling out blame. And yet, here we are.\n\nI say this as an international observer - someone who hasn't been caught up with the hyper-partisanship and tribalism that is clearly afflicting many Americans - you guys need to take a step back and have a good look at yourselves and what you're becoming. What you've already become. When you can't tell fact from fiction at the most basic levels - when your prejudices are affecting your judgement to this extent, something has gone seriously wrong. And as alarming as this is - and it should be alarming to just about everyone - it appears like a huge segment of both media and laypeople (as evidenced in the comment section here) alike are clearly more interested in indulging in their hatred and self satisfied criticism, than giving any thought to the content of the discussion."	
3231,"please run hillary so we can get another 4 years of trump"	
3232,"Giving Hillary airtime and mindshare instead of Bernie, when the former is busy profiting from book sales and interviews and the latter is attempting to introduce Universal Health Care and actively fighting Trump. smdh"	
3233,"It takes an hour to say everyone's fault but mine?"	
3234,"Hate her all you want guys, but you have to admit, wouldn't it be nice to have a president who's actually informed and can converse intelligently on actual issues?"	
3235,"Man listening to center-right corporate dems is like sitting through that annual PowerPoint presentation at work that no one wants to attend...can they all just be absorbed into the republicans already and we start a New Left?"	
3236,"Why does Vox care what she thinks, she was the most corrupt politician in recent history and lost to Donald Trump"	
3237,"I still don't understand how people POSSIBLY think she's worse than Trump."	
3238,"hilary clintons democratic opponent bernie is still in government still fighting for what he believes is right, healthcare for all and free college, compared to hilary, who wrote a book about how bernie was the reason she lost...."	
3239,"Can you own so much turquois?"	
3240,"What voter suppression is going on? Requiring an ID to vote makes it to where it is harder to cheat in elections. Election and voter fraud are a real thing. What is so racist about requiring an ID to vote?"	
3241,"Both her and Trump are in the same poo filled bag. #liarliarpantsonfire #goaway"	
3242,"Instead of Secretary Clinton he should've said Not President Ms Clinton"	
3243,"Hillary Clinton wants to tell you 'What Happened' ... MH17 = MH370 = lord Watt illuminati agent getting cloned and send back to CIA EU , he loved that russian lady`s so much ."	
3244,"Thank God we did not elect this witch."	
3245,"One of Hillary's problems is that her positions on issues may have seemed more grounded, by they also didn't solve the problem. For example: When Sanders talked about public college being free (through a regulatory measure, similar to what is done in the UK), Hillary's proposal was tuition free college in which tax credits would be given to help subsidize the cost of college, but only for families below a certain income bracket. So you have tax money being used for college credits for certain people, which does nothing to actually curb the out-of-control costs of college education. All it does is give colleges an excuse to increase their tuition rates because now, the money would be coming from the government instead of students. \n\nAnother example: Universal Healthcare. Hillary said, 90% of people are covered, so it's easier to just get the other 10%. Maybe. But the 90% don't all have good, or affordable coverage. They're just covered. The plan of extending Obamacare further doesn't do anything to actually curb the out-of-control costs of healthcare, because her plan continued to see cooperation with the money-sucking insurance companies. See? There's a pattern here."

3247,"Okay, but in all seriousness, she's still a politician, putting a camera and microphone on her is a pretty surefire way to not get her true thoughts out."	
3248,"What did she accomplish again?"	
3249,"This was very good! Thoughtful and thorough! Nice I liked it! Good job! 🤗"	
3250,"The world dodged the biggest bullet with this woman"	
3251,"I actually really enjoyed this interview it really showed a human side of Hillary when so many people make her seem like a demon. I only wish it was conducted from a jail cell with shackles at her feet because she is a failed stateswoman that got nothing done and is a criminal against this nation and the rule of law."	
3252,"You know you're a fail when you lose to a commie and trump #maga"	
3253,"Go away Hillary, we're just not into you..."	
3254,"Thank God this venal, mendacious, self-absorbed woman did not become president."	
3255,"32:30 Thank you for pushing back on her assertion that donations *didn't* affect how Obama governed. Who was bailed out? Who was in his cabinet?"	
3256,"You can tell Ezra Klein has a past in sports, when he asks softball questions like this"	
3257,"I voted for her but I still believe she is a flip flopping politician who owed to many people loyalty to make a truly good president."	
3258,"Where was this Hillary during the elections? I didn't see her like this!!! What a shame..."	
3259,"The irony as she rambles on one of the many, MANY leftist pushing media outlets about the right controlling the media."	
3260,"it's sad that the election candidates came to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are corrupt liars the best America has to choose from? oh wait, that is what politics in general has become"	
3261,"I want this lady to come back next election and come back stronger."	
3262,"She should have done universal basic income, universal healthcare, and other socialism. Then the far right and far left would've had a better meme war. Centrists are boring.\n It I guess what she is saying is that some of that isn't practical, and she wouldn't have been able to explain how it would get done?"	
3263,"Who else wishes she spoke clearly like this during the election itself?"	
3264,"the only thing Hillary did wrong was be too polite"	
3265,"yeah, attack the media, obama, joe biden, bernie but not you. gj hillary, classic female."	
3266,"I actually really enjoyed this interview."	
3267,"I definitely think Hillary Clinton's viewpoint that the American people care about details, analyses, facts, and legislative precision was inaccurate. A large portion of both the primaries and the general election *is* a personality contest, whether we like to admit it or not. You need to learn to appeal to different crowds while still maintaining a focus on your agenda items.\n\nIt wasn't that Hillary didn't have that focus - I think she expended far too much energy in maintaining it, and not enough on figuring out what crowds wanted, or how to tailor her speeches so that both laypeople and those in-the-know would get a sense of who she was as a person and leader.\n\nThe end result of the loss can be blamed on the timing of a variety of events and the presence of a variety of scandals, real or imagined, but a large part of the responsibility lies with how she chose to run a data-centric, cold-and-clinical campaign. I hope future leaders learn from her missteps.\n\nAs for her commentary on Obama and her husband...I don't think they ran anywhere near as clinically as she believes. I do think they were more capable of being a visionary, of matching personalities with their opponents."	
3268,"Here's the Bernie Sanders convo from 1 year that Vox did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5vOKKMipSA. Still waiting on Trump's one"	
3269,"Hillary isn't too mad about what happened in the end, because deep down she knows she won and that Kobach et al stole it for the Republicans. Even Trump didn't even expect to win."	
3270,"Number one on the agenda, for both the Democratic and Republican parties, should be to slow down the death-spiral of rising healthcare costs.\n\nNo plan, not Obamacare nor a Trumpcare plan will ever be feasible if these prices outpace GDP growth."	
3271,"I gave the Clinton Foundation a million dollars and all I got for it was her book. I hate it when I don't get the correct change back."	
3272,"**Vox is Liberal Propaganda** HILLARY FOR PRISON! 1 LIKE ON THIS COMMENT EQUALS 1 VOTE FOR HER TO GO TO PRISON!!"

3274,"I am Chinese.And i like the honest one.DONALD TRUMP did a great job.though he always makes mistakes in midea eyes.He is on the right way.At least i think so."	
3275,"I'm a simple man. I see Hillary's face, I drop a dislike and leave."	
3276,"I wonder if McCain and Romney would have gotten this much attention if they had written a why I lost book. Wait, they have class so they wouldn't have published a book in the first place"	
3277,"Hillary saying democrats don't control the media. Lol! Yes, democrats control the mainstream media but nobody believes or takes them seriously anymore."	
3278,"Pathetic piece by loser Ezra. She's a corrupt corporate Democrat willing to trample on progressives to further her right-wing agenda. She's pro-war, oil, and pharma. What's the point of this interview? She's already pointed the finger at everyone else for her embarrassing loss. Stop giving her airtime and Ezra- grow a pair and stop being a wide eyed fanboy"	
3279,"She has a public and a private belief system. If you believe anything out of this woman's mouth you are willfully ignorant or absolutely dense."	
3280,"I've had the bizarre luck to come across both candidates in NYC. One had a huge entourage and didn't look anyone in the eye. The other took a moment to shake my hand, see ME, and ask about my life. Which was which do you think?"

3502,"I love how Andy keeps trying to stir the pot regarding T Swift and not one of these older celebrities gives a shit"	
3503,"She might not have that scarf but she sure has the face of a hound dog ...😕😕😕😕"	
3504,"Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina 😊 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg"	
3505,"Maybe someone can use that scarf and silence Taylor swift."	
3506,"it might not have been about jake?"	
3507,"It may not look that bad in Florida but the Caribbean islands are the ones that got hit the most"	
3508,"What a lot of people don't realize is that even though it didn't completely obliterate Florida, there are many of the islands like the Bahamas and various other places that will never ever be the same again. This storm was a monster, but we're only focused on what it did to one place and not the rest."	
3509,"Boohoo shpw the Caribbean. It's gone. Not all this happy white suburban homes without roofs. People in st marteen don't have roofs anymore either... OR HOMES"	
3510,"So where are the fly overs of Bermuda?"	
3511,"Hi! Check out my channel for tv reviews and recommendations. Thanks :D"	
3512,"I am so sick of people saying not that bad,not everyone is rich or can afford to rebuild."	
3513,"Try to use appropriate adjectives to describe events rather than over exaggerating to get views like a below average YouTube editor...."	
3514,"It wasn't that bad in parts of Florida ,but it hit the Carribean horribly"	
3515,"a horrible attempt to try and get us to freak out"	
3516,"You know, spotlight should be shown where the hurricane was actually catastrophic: down in the Island Nations. Place where there is no more infrastructure anymore. Where people can't find food anymore because of the hurricane. Not where someone's boat is half sunken or a roof was torn off and that's it."	
3517,"So some trailers were missing some roofs and that's it? Wheres the flattened buildings or flooded city streets?"	
3518,"Why are they only showing mobile homes?\nAren't they less likely to go through a big storm like this?"	
3519,"This isn’t bad at all... if you wanna see bad then look at the Caribbean islands where it looks like Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II."	
3520,"From the air USA Today posts fake news."	
3521,"That was not shit"	
3522,"I don't see how you can call it not bad when millions of people are without power and they are not going to have food or gasoline for a long time without having to resort to emergency support. Many of the homes are not going to be able to be rebuilt for years if at all and the property will be sold to the highest bidder and they will not rent to these people who are not able to live in their homes now. Supplies go to the richest people who can afford to rebuild and or live somewhere else while they are waiting for their homes. They are going to be waiting for insurance for homes, cars and boats. They are not going to be working for quite a while now. They are not going to be ok in a week. Many have no air conditioning now in the heat. This was not a weak 🌀. There are sick, elderly and disabled people trying to manage right now and figure out how to get by with the devestation. Weak 🌀, I don't think so"	
3523,"Wouldn't call this catastrophic"	
3524,"All those Mullets.  Oh the horror.  The horror."	
3525,"Trailer park videos! Really? That's normal."	
3526,"It's not that bad"	
3527,"Lool. If you call this bad then that's nothing. Seriously these look right next to the ocean too. Trailer park looked decent. Did you plan the before and after, common? You can't call this catastrophic"	
3528,"They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep"	
3529,"*BUT DID IT DESTROY A GAMING CHAIR*"	
3530,"this is one of the worst videos I've ever seen"	
3531,"why is it all mobile homes on cement slabs and tin roof panel houses? of course these types of structures would break easy."	
3532,"Lol!!! A few cardboard box houses were blown away.... devastating"	
3533,"First off. This was sad in comparison to Andrew. Second, WHO FILMS DRONE SHOTS IN 1x1?! It looks terrible."	
3534,"They gassed this hurricane up like it was bouta be the end of florida. The News Hyping it up like florida wasnt going to be on the map anymore"	
3535,"lmfao at anyone who thought this was actually gonna devastate anything. Florida experiences hurricanes quite frequently. As a result, most houses are built to last through a hurricane of substantial power. The media definitely overplayed this one lol"	
3536,"Has everyone forgot bout hurricane Harvey victims and are worried bout just Florida....?"	
3537,"Catastrophic? Sit down."	
3538,"We don't care about mobile homes. Show us more of regular houses, that's what's interesting because everyone knows a mobile home can't hold up to a hurricane."	
3539,"Remember to pay your climate change dues so this shit won't happen anymore."	
3540,"When you get click-baited by the news 😂"	
3541,"bahahaha what's with all that saturation with before irma show us the real pics and don't make it too exaggerated yeesh"	
3542,"Its nit that bad from what i see"	
3543,"It was a CAT 3 at landfall and quickly weakened soon after made worse only by the fact that many a moron live in aluminum boxes. Are those things even anchored beyond electric & gas connectors?"	
3544,"Looks like a trailer park in texas after a small tornado."	
3545,"Had to stop it 5 seconds in because of the music. Fail"	
3546,"Stop making houses out of cardboard"	
3547,"We will rebuild we always do...LOVE TEXAS & FLORIDA 👍"	
3548,"Never thought people would argue over who's city got destroyed the most."	
3549,"OH MY GOD!!! THE WORST STORM EVER SLIGHTLY DAMAGED SOME PROPERTIES! CALL FEMA! \n\nWhat is Florida's death toll again?"	
3550,"Hurricane Andrew literally flattened entire suburbs. This is far far from a catastrophe."	
3551,"It really wasn't as bad as it could be."	
3552,"And the wolf went to the fourth little pig, who made his mobile home out of cheap materials and paper mache ......."	
3553,"Irma kicked the shit out of those trailer parks."	
3554,"It's almost like Andrew."	
3555,"For a category 3 hurricane it's pretty okay"	
3556,"Lmfao people are disappointed that is wasn't worse wtf is wrong with you people"	
3557,"media trying to stir up more fear"	
3558,"Make your houses out of stone you will feel like nothing ever happened"	
3559,"I don't believe it"	
3560,"Trump is in trouble, he has to donate 2 million dollars now. He's going to be broke"	
3561,"Woow! So much for catastrophic damages. Even the trailer parks are still standing! 😂😂😂"	
3562,"Whats with the horrible music? tf"	
3563,"Other then some property damage and laying tress, irma did nothing"	
3564,"Thank you God that I did not get hit and my family in Florida is fine. God bless all the people that got hit. I wish the best for you"	
3565,"👍 Thumbs up if you were expecting a creepy clown with this music.   🤡"	
3566,"Building codes in Florida should make structure more wind resistant. But to me it looks corners were cute. And i cant feel sorry for people live in mobil homes next to the shore in hurricane alley (Florida). Thats just stupid."	
3567,"Really f#ck these square video's. Smartphone manufacturers: Here's bigger screen with higher resolution than ever! Facebook: Here is a square compressed to death video! Enjoy! "	
3568,"I've lived in Florida- Miami, Melbourne, & Jacksonville- and the strangest universal truth becomes obvious after hurricanes: there are a LOT of trailer parks in Florida on some very high-dollar property. And even stranger is that these people will all rebuild in the same place, over and over again. It never ceases to amaze me that someone would want to live in such a flimsy homes knowing that they're going to see severe storms every few years."	
3569,"what about mexico and cuba?"	
3570,"i dont think it caused a lot of damage."	
3571,"Houston got it bad, Florida came out not that bad"	
3572,"This is like a picnic in the park with Elmo. Anybody see damage in the Caribbean, Cuba, and the FL Keys."	
3573,"THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.  COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE."	
3574,"Y'all acting like Irma didn't hit the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Smh. It did damage plenty and it may not have damaged Florida on a massive scale but thank goodness for that."	
3575,"Show the carribeans! That's real catastrophe!"	
3576,"They hyped this storm up to be absolutely devastating when it hit Florida but it was no where near that...smh"	
3577,"Meanwhile Barbuda got wiped off the planet ...."	
3578,"I like how they're only covering Florida but not the Carribean that got fucked by the strongest hurricane to be ever formed in the Atlantic at its strongest point (190 MPH Winds and 225 MPH Gusts) that even caused places like Barbuda to be Inhabitable (meaning you're not allowed to live there anymore) which the entirety of that island got 95-100% destroyed. And the dozens that also died throughout there. They didn't even cover Puerto Rico, which the US owns. Like shit..."	
3579,"Irma: It's over! I have the high ground!"	
3580,"Why not just go to the islands that actually got hit with cat 5 winds"	
3581,"Irma wasn't that bad.."	
3582,"Quit overhyping it. Andrew was worse."	
3583,"https://youtu.be/wJBBlntDtEU"

3585,"THATS NOTHING, DENIED!"	
3586,"lol nothing"	
3587,"this has to be the most clickbait fraudulent claim of destruction I've ever seen. small tornadoes will do 10x the amount of damage this did. who's agenda are you fulfilling usa today???"	
3588,"what overhyped bullshit"	
3589,"Trump is a Cat 5 dumbass.😂😂😂"

3651,"Girl, don't leave me hangin. What was the fail foundation?"	
3652,"As a guy this much makeup is a huge turn off. Just look at her shoulders and then her face she looks off. This is the type of girl you give a hug at a party and then look down at your new shirt ruined and caked in makeup. \nNatural beauty over fake any day. \nJust my opinion as a 22 year old."

3717,"liam neeson kills people on a train the movie"	
3718,"Okay so obviously this takes place after they have kidnapped his daughter then his wife. As you can see because this must be his second marriage. Where I'm confused though, does this take place before working for the Irish Mob and working in Alaska or after??"	
3719,"First he was set up in a plane, now in a train, so next should be a boat or did I miss that one XD"

3737,"So he kills again?"

3741,"This could be either really good or really bad.."	
3742,"Didn't he say he was done with these type of movies? Old people forget so quickly."

3811,"I don't use my phone to run away from myself, I use it so I don't have to interact with others lol"	
3812,"Very nice message & some awesome animation & narration to go a long with it. Yeah this is a topic I think about a lot. In fact I made a little satire series called Strange Stories to kind of poke fun at how we function with all this advanced technology now."	
3813,"I love that this is posted on the day iPhone X's premiere was released. XD"	
3814,"Enjoy your freedom of thought before our phones literally become a part of us. I can see it now, silent obedience with just the snap of a finger."	
3815,"Well I wouldn't have seen this without my phone just saying 🤔"	
3816,"You say that like it's a bad thing... \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!"	
3817,"I'm so obsessed with my phone lol"	
3818,"looks like the eraser head baby all grown up at 2:05"	
3819,"The problem with your phone is it's an iPhone"

3821,"Is it just me or was that thought super cute"

3824,"I have no friends"	
3825,"Aha! Releasing this on the same day the iPhone X/8 were announced? You dogs!"	
3826,"this is an amazing video, the animation is great and you actually say some interesting things.\n\nmemento mori"	
3827,"problem isn't with phones but with ourselves. \nlike hello....move your ass a little around!!"	
3828,"We spend too much time with our phones, why we should talk to other people in real life, if we could spent our whole life to stare on our phone? (I'm guilty too in this case, so please don't judge me!) ^^"	
3829,"capitalism and materialism are the problems"	
3830,"My break from my phone is photography... granted, I listen to music via my phone, but at least I'm not still staring at it... and fuck off if you say my cameras a screen, I spend much more time looking around and through the view finder than at the screen"	
3831,"why did this video take such a dark turn... didnt expect a video about phones to be so morbid"	
3832,"can you the same things for books, youtube, knowledgable video ? plz explain . . . where the scattered knowledge come from . . . what is the right path to become knowledgable without addiction"	
3833,"I think in the future we will(or should) have classes in school that teach kids the pitfalls of technology and how to stay balanced with one's self in the information age.\nI for one make an active effort to keep balance in my life, even though I love technology and actually work with computers and phones(or maybe because of it). But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy."

3835,"Anyone ever been to Lyon here ?! :)"	
3836,"I've had a GSM in the 90's, hated it and never got a mobile phone again, smart or otherwise. What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple.."	
3837,"That was a load of pseudo-intellectual babble.. Far below the standards I've gotten to used to expecting from this channel. \nShame."	
3838,"i managed to watch 1/3 of this before checking my email"	
3839,"This video sounds warm and believable, but in fact, it is wrong.\n\nBecause the problem is not with our phones, instead, it's with us.\n\nIt is like saying the problem with knifes: then, you say that it kill. While it does not kill, but it can be used to kill, also, it can be used for many purposes."	
3840,"Oh the irony since I'm watching this on my phone, probably more than 2/3rds or the comment section."	
3841,"1:10 - Scary how this described my current problem at the moment."	
3842,"Tl	dr: get off your phone because it's apparently blocking us from some kind of utopian future even though most of you are watching this on your phone\n\n\n\nI don't get it"
3843,"I'm having a hard time putting my finger on this one but something about the videos produced by these guys rubs me the wrong but I can not seem to articulate it.  But, I am getting the sense that I'm being preached to and I feel that many of the ideas that are being asserted should be debated.  Perhaps that is the point of the videos.....  at least I hope that is."	
3844,"Its not the technology, but the way people use it. A phone can be used to shoot a video for a project or to create music with creativity, or even draw a picture, which creates a platform to express yourself that anyone can access. Or it can be used as a crutch where you can't even think for yourself and rely on social media as a way to feel apart of something. We can't blame the corporations for profiting off the ignorance of the masses, thats just how human nature is. Its the job of people to elevate their own consciousness to become self aware enough to determine a life they want to live."	
3845,"Watching this sitting on the toilet taking a dump and reading the comments. :O"	
3846,"I don't see anything wrong with that. And I watching this video with my phone. Knowledge is the biggest enemy of the scammers"	
3847,"Same thing as blaming the gun for the murder.  The phone isn't the problem, you are.  If you decide to use your phone to look at pornography all day, that's your choice.  If you decide to use your phone to connect with your grandmother thousands of miles away, that's your choice.  If you can't learn to use the tool you have in your pocket in moderation, that's your choice."	
3848,"Good thing I'm using my phone to ignore everything in general."	
3849,"Battery life is the problem"	
3850,"Irony of watching this video in a phone..!"	
3851,"I do not own a phone. I was asked what the time was once, by this human girl person, and I said	 I don't know, because I didn't know. The human girl person asked me if I didn't have a phone on me. I said no, because I didn't. She glared at me like I was personally insulting her by trying to fool her into thinking I had no phone.\n But yeah, I guess I can understand her mistrust...everyone nowadays has a phone..."
3852,"Bull\n5h17\nGo back to your secluded farm. In a way, I think it's more exciting to actually run a farm than playing FarmVille. Just be kind with the piglets."	
3853,"I have my phone on me but rarely get a call. Or text. Somewhat feel I need it on me but on occasions I leave behind.  I want technology to aid my life, get something from it rather than pointless time wasting."	
3854,"Listen to Arcade Fire's Everything Now album. We're addicted to this instant gratification our phones provide us. The more readily available something is, the less we value it. It's a dangerous game, and I think people need to wake up soon."	
3855,"42 second's in Nope this doesn't apply to me at all, I can quite happily live without my phone, its only use is to keep family/friends in contact other than that its not important to me, So nice generalizations at the start of the video"	
3856,"phone is like a kitchen knife, we can use for cooking or we can use for murder someone, the first thing we should to know is understanding about a phone itself and ourselves."	
3857,"To be honest I use my phone as something to express my thoughts, to develop my thoughts and to have a better understanding of things."	
3858,"This video dosen't make any sense. I use my phone all the time, and I've never felt anything u've told in this video."	
3859,"This video is nonsense"	
3860,"Rambles on about how we use our phone too much or incorrectly, only to sell us a link at the end of the video. Wat"	
3861,"I'm glad i grew up in the 90's without smart phones, and today I use my phone to answer, make calls and check my voicemail."	
3862,"with or without a phone I will spend all my free time indoors masturbating."	
3863,"school of life can we have more philosophy videos please? my life is disappointingly empty without them."	
3864,"They don''t keep a charge for more than 2 hours. Thats the problem with our phones."	
3865,"This guy's voice haha what the fuck"	
3866,"I like the critique of smart-phones, but found this imagined future technology worse. Let's admit now what the ancient Greeks knew and told in their myths (and here we can include too the ancient Indians, Chinese and Japanese who knew and told likewise): often technologies and machines are just bad."	
3867,"I got rid of my social media and cut my cable off but now I just watch youtube constantly. I have to get a hobby or more of a social life so I can cut it out all together."	
3868,"Everybody laughed at the fat people from Wall-E. But that will be us soon."

3870,"if you're at the edge of the grand canyon or by the matterhorn you're not gonna have service. so no i won't be postmating food to the matterhorn"	
3871,"Oh my how profound very intelligent"	
3872,"I turn this video on to do to sleep listening to something so my mind doesn't wander for hours |:-)"	
3873,"I don't see how this is a new problem, my grandma used to go to a library to find information instead of consulting ourselves"	
3874,"In the Utopia - and that's when I checked out.\nWhat's more likely to happen?  Maybe a big tech corporatocracy.  Maybe a singularity gone horribly wrong.  Maybe a cyber cold war not just between opposing nations but between security and privacy.  Maybe, if George Carlin is right, the planet will shake us off like fleas.  But no matter how smart technology gets, it will only ever be a tool, not a guardian angel."	
3875,"Wow, that was a lot of big english words."

3878,"The problem is that government has regulated everything....so free thinking is discouraged by the state. You will and you can be arrest for thinking beyond what the government allows...."	
3879,"We stand in the shoulders of giants... And through my phone and the information age I can see everywhere... I am an introvert who hates small talk, my world has grown significantly... Its not your phone, but how you use it... Ironically I used my phone to watch this video..."	
3880,"I have been working on trying to stay away from my phone for useless things and trying to focus and be more productive. Self-awareness and being present are two of the most crucial elements of humanity that we need to start practising once again. Btw, this is quite possibly one of the most wonderful videos I've watched and the writing is remarkable!!"	
3881,"Well I just realized this few days ago, I'm someone who spends A Lot of time on phone, and it's kind of scary that no matter how much time I spend, I'll never be able to watch all the watch laters or getting information about the subject I want because it is infinite, humans tend to look for happiness and phone help us get rid of sadness or in forgetting sadness, but I certainly realized I'm not talking to myself and it really bother me so I'm trying but certainly we need something more advanced because now you can get so much information with the phone that we can never review it."

3899,"0:30  Yoooooo Fuck this shit. Please! Please. Don't think this is your own self. Sitting in a room letting your thoughts flow to simultaneously the past and future, feeling at the same time pain, desire, regret and excitement all at the same time. The Mean is to be in a room just watching. Being in the moment not pretending your in the past or future. I mean why were those emotions chosen? every emotion is surely a part of life but thoughts of desire, pain and regret do not seem great to me. It's videos like this that let me know some part of the world wants to lead somewhere sad."

3901,"What a fucking human we all are becoming...."

GOOP basically takes advantage of misinformed people, that spend money they don't have to buy things they don't need, don't work, may be harmful, and are overpriced, because they somehow trust Paltrow for advice. Some examples of snake oil scams promoted recently by the magazine: 1. Wellness stickers from NASA that were publicly discredited by NASA, which confirmed the product has no technology developed by NASA in it. 2. Yoni Jade Eggs, which women are supposed to put inside their vaginas, which in the words of OB-GYN Dr. Gunter could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome	 and 3. Vaginal Steaming which doctors also call a load of garbage. Just to name a few. They have been repeatedly knocked for false advertising, misleading advertising, and settled lawsuits out of court. It is truly horrifying to see CBS promoting this garbage. I hope CBS is named in future lawsuits that are sure to come as people are injured and/or simply realize they were duped by Paltrow and GOOP."

4812,"Looks like a cheap watch for kids."	
4813,"Frankly, why can't Apple come up with better form factors for the watch?  Why does it have to look so effeminate and generic that is so bland and boring?  Seems the place (Apple) is run by engineers.  None of the products raise any heartbeats.  One would expect more from the richest company in the world!"	
4814,"It will be nice if it was a standalone device with its own App Store and wireless headphones included."	
4815,"I hate people telling me Android did it first. \n\nApple did it right. \n\nHave you seen how ugly the other smart watches are? \n\nHave you seen how bad the other smart watches software is?"

4847,"is that a cellular one ?"	
4848,"is it water proof?"	
4849,"I don't care who makes a watch but LTE is no place for a watch. This is just another way to justify the price of a device across the board nut just Apple. How fast can the OS of a watch run? It's a damn watch, so buy the watch cuz it's fast then buy iPhone 4 just to make calls? Until there is something significant that the series 2 watch can't do, then it's a waist of $$$$$."	
4850,"Im really for it, it really depends on how much it will cost monthly. It better not be any more than 10 dollars"	
4851,"Can someone please explain what it means to have the LTE? If I buy the non LTE, can I still use my watch without having my iPhone on my at all times?"

God does NOT want us to end up in hell, a place of eternal, conscious torment and suffering (Not parties). We can all live in eternal paradise with no pain and no suffering forever. It’s one place or the other. Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless."

Trey may have not even finished writing the script yet for fuck's sake. \n\nThe good news is South Park isn't serialized this time around. So if you absolutely hate this episode, presumably the next one will feature a completely different story.

5353,"S.H.I.E.L.D is dealing with super human threats even without Captain America ever since Agent Carter and Howard Star started it. And Hank Pym was around for a long time even after WWII. You failed the Antman movie, After Hours team. The Avengers are just a scouted new superhero generation."	
5354,"Did you see that katy? I diagreed! Kek."	
5355,"NO Nick Fury ,, fought off Skrull off before he even meet Tony ,, this alll will be reviled in Captain Marvel  that would be a time based movie set in the pass before Iron man and Hulk and Avengers"

5357,"Michael, why/how are you in the audience of the Dave Chappelle Netflix special?"	
5358,"Catculator... that got me way too good"	
5359,"Your Marvel theory lacks X-Men. The Avengers are only separate in the movie universe because of the studio rights. Nick Fury knew there were super dudes and many x-men were avengers in the comics but can't be tied again due to rights. So realistically, just as in Deadpool where other x-men were referenced but not show because they couldn't afford rights for any major characters, there were plenty Superheroes in the world to justify the creation of the Avengers.... just not enough studio cooperation to do so lol"	
5360,"You forgot the best Friday the 13th film- Jason X"	
5361,"I love that Daniel pronounces Voldemort in that annoyingly correct way, instead of how the say it in the movies."	
5362,"What's in the box?"	
5363,"With the mcu time line there is a theory that Nick Fury is a clairvoyant so it would make sense that he knew all about Thor, The Hulk, and the New York attack so that's why he recuited Iron Man before any of that happened."	
5364,"Wtf is this shit? Lmao \nThis acting corny af! Like watching a group of retards act"	
5365,"Oh god. Thanks be to putting the originals back on. Gooooood job"	
5366,"Fury is not crazy:There were not just reports of The Hulk, the US military fought him and then he fought Abomination downtown. He already had Natasha and Clint on his payroll. All that was missing was Thor.Besides SHIELD probably knew about many others. Even so, the World Council knew about this, which would make them crazy too."	
5367,"Is no one going to mention the fact that Hawkeye, Black Widow, Ironman, Ant-Man, Technically captain marvel because her movie is set to be in the (90s or 80s), and presumably the hulk, is still an amazingly good team for the avengers initiative."	
5368,"I'm so glad she brought up the Friday the 13th timeline. I've always tried to pinpoint the years that are supposed to have passed between each film. Also, when she mentions the Evil Dead being part of the shared Universe, it should be noted that a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason was drafted that had Ash from Evil Dead fighting them both."	
5369,"I thought of the same thing Daniel did and asked the same thing. Fury wants to establish a response team to supernormal threats, but who is on his list? Romanov and Barton? 2 human SHIELD agents? Plus, he didn't even want Stark. He wanted Iron Man. So who is actually part of the Avengers Initiative?"	
5370,"Did you just say that the first Iron Man took place before World War II?"	
5371,"Did they meen army of darkness not evil dead"	
5372,"thank the mighty buddha it's not the other four"	
5373,"ya the A team is back!!!"

5376,"Friday the 13th < Nightmare on Elm Street"

5380,"Katie is a Friday the 13th fanatic? If I wasn't married I'd be proposing right now"	
5381,"Man...I need to go watch Seven..."	
5382,"you're not supposed to think about these things!!! jeez!"	
5383,"Thank fuck it was the A team, am I right?"	
5384,"i think these all line up perfectly. so therefore. i win"	
5385,"The marvel one isn't valid. Fury new about the existence of Iron Man, Hulk, Ant Man, and potentially Captain America. Its also possible he knew about Black Panther (as seen how Wakanda is a highlighted region on Shield's map in Iron man 2). Apparently, he also new about Captain Marvel, which takes place in the 90s. \n\nThe point is he knew there were other super heroes in the world besides Iron Man and was likely planning to recruit any that he  could to be on the avengers."	
5386,"never leave again bitches. i almost said goodbye to afterhours"	
5387,"Ya sorry as much as I wish I liked the new crew the original 4 are just so much better"	
5388,"Have y'all got star doing the drawings now?"	
5389,"I have a whole seven page timeline on Friday the 13th."	
5390,"Katie is a boss. Finally a proper break down of my other favorite Friday film series. Wait what if Debo is Jason??? :O"

5395,"Please please please oh please just stick with these four"	
5396,"Why is Jake Paul in this?"	
5397,"Nick Fury is like the NSA being created after 911. A catastrophe happens, and he jumps on the opportunity to create his superteam project because tax dollars are flowing to defense spending."	
5398,"I won't read this comment. What a Dick I am, I can't believe I just read this. I am pathetic!"	
5399,"Wow...everyone just shittin all over a beloved horror franchise lol"	
5400,"Wow. Even if we assume the After Hours guys only meet once a week, 80 episodes means they've been doing it less than 2 years... It feels longer."	
5401,"Ima be that guy. Agents of SHIELD showed that SHIELD had its eye on, and if I remember correctly locked up, plenty of super powered people. Its just that none of them ended up making the cut, which is pretty amazing because thor made the cut just by showing up and trying to kill cap and tony."	
5402,"Is After Hours usually this high def?"	
5403,"I've seen the Marvel timeline but that never occurred to me"	
5404,"I saw this on the trending page. I wasn't going to keep watching this until I saw Star in the background. RIP Sourcefed."	
5405,"So their is actually a reason fury has to start the avengers initiative according to marvel captain marvel takes place in the 90's with fury in it against the skrull."	
5406,"Fury knows about aliens cause of captain marvel"	
5407,"i disagree with the billions of dollars spent on the avengers initiative  because  they  didn't spend much at all tony payed for almost all of it"

5410,"This pretty much confirms for me that Fury learns about Skrulls in the 1990s (Capt. Marvel movie), and waits until someone pops up (e.g. Iron Man) to start an initiative towards fighting them."	
5411,"Dark Knight Rises should be on here if it's not. Honestly don't know how Bruce Wayne got back to Gotham after the prison escape so quickly."

5415,"Someone must have not remembered the avengers!!! They started the avengers in the movie avengers. The team was an idea before that movie as a fail safe but was never formed. The government had shut it down before it was formed as said in the movie and only was formed becauce of Loki. Annnnnnd they already knew of super powered beings from the hulk having existed well before iron man 1, ant man existed, and captain America existed (and was frozen unbeknownst) so they had an idea to find super powered beings around the world and get them on the side of good knowing that the odds that all super beings being friendly is super low. They then went out in search from the start of iron man until the avengers creating a superbeing archive of names and people that were super powered to decide if they are good or bad and then create a fail safe using the good super beings. Then Loki strikes and Thor comes and that's when nick fury reaches out to all those archived super heroes to create the avengers in said movie."

5433,"Well John Doe could have decided in advance that Envy was his sin, and that he wanted Rage to be the guy who kills him. Part of his manifesto is that the whole world is corrupt, that the victims are not that particularly chosen, but that it could be anyone. It would probably be a big thing for him that mostly anyone could be driven to kill in rage if you push them the right way. He could have decided to use Mills for Rage during their chase, that's why he spares his life, he's like yesss, this one will do.. and starts planning how he can get envious at him and drive him to killing."

5582,"I was wondering how good your solo music would be... this is so meaningful <3"	
5583,"is she some sort of pop star?"	
5584,"Great another terrible female singer that uses her body to get views. And you wonder why men don't respect you girls"	
5585,"Who is this nothing bitch? What a pointless individual!"	
5586,"she is completely clueless"	
5587,"Haha Jim Carrey trolled the fuck out of you!"	
5588,"This no-name bitch is feeling 'sad' for Jim Carrey.. How thick-skulled can a reporter be? He started the fucking interview with this is all meaningless of course he's going to give your eye-rolling face a sarcastic interview. I never thought E! News was credible (obviously), but this really takes the cake for obliviousness."	
5589,"You were sad for the person who called you out on being meaningless?  You pompous, self-inflating people got embarrassed because a celebrity didn't do what you wanted and instead gave you a truth you couldn't swallow.  Do you really take yourselves that seriously?"	
5590,"If you ever get a chance, watch the DVD extras of a movie called Bat Thumb. The character who plays Wuce Bayne has a speech just like the start of this video. Mannerisms to a T! Hahaha"	
5591,"Bunch of airheads over at E! News, I'm in the dark, what's exactly the issue here?"	
5592,"He is a powerful man, well done JC."	
5593,"This is what happens when a monkey try to read a book of knowledge"	
5594,"Who is truly the brainwashed sheep. Jim who has seen the truth, or you who are still blind.\n\nI'll let you think about that one, Catt."	
5595,"He legit is the only sane one there....and her saying she's sad for him is the saddest thing ever...these corrupt lowlife self-contained robots are the downfall of this world and because this man actually sees life for what it's really worth their going to make him look insane....they need to look at the monsters they've become...hypnotizing a generation into being stuck up judgemental snobs....shame on them for doing that to our youth....the message Jim Carrey just sent out live to the world is what needs to be known ....we're all energy ..they want you to see black white yellow brown....he doesn't see that and neither should the rest of us....we're all the same in the end"	
5596,"Just because you can't comprehend what he tried explaining to you doesn't mean something is wrong with him.  Stick to fashion."	
5597,"This condescending, pretentious nitwit couldn't hold a deep conversation with someone as much as a glass of water could. He's right: fashion week is pointless. Her job is pointless. Entertainment news is pointless."	
5598,"What's wrong with her hair in the interview?"	
5599,"Honey your brain is too limited to understand what Jimmy and similar people are talking about, btw look at your dislikes"	
5600,"That woman is an idiot. Why would he want to agree to have on open conversation with someone with nothing but dead air between her ears?"	
5601,"When you talk about something different and try to have a intellectual conversation rather than who's sleeping with who or which celebrity is pregnant or which one has the biggest tits all of a sudden you are bizzare"	
5602,"Fashion week is a dull event with dull people. It seems Jim had some fun amongst so much vane people."	
5603,"Wow, I expected the interview to be so much more shocking. These children can't have a conversation these days. It's all about me! me! me! me! me! me!"	
5604,"Most meaningless thing happening. I'd say he's spot on."	
5605,"You should not be sad for him, I'm sad for you and your audience that doesn't get it.  The rest of the world needs to catch up with the wisdom he is sharing."	
5606,"Dude what the fuck. E news didn't show all of it. Jim Carrey doesn't have a twisted relationship with fame. Jim Carrey (somewhere along the way) humbled himself and realized that the world doesn't revolve around money, fame, and the spotlight. There's more to life than Hollywood and I'm actually with Jim on this shit. It doesn't matter, not a fucking bit. Psychedelics may or may not have been involved in his thought process but at least he's not a scientologist."	
5607,"This happens when you take too much substance."	
5608,"I think it's important to watch the full video. I believe he's on to something. This version is horribly edited. I think Jim Carey could sit down and explain this but I think the background laughing and editing on this video don't do the full segment justice. I know they have to keep it short but I like people to provide the link in the description if they are going to edit something.\nHere's the link to the video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5s0vpVIOXg"	
5609,"People are so judge mental"	
5610,"The red pilled your meaningless zombie life, but you're to drunk on the kool-aid to see the forest for all the trees. Clearly he was the only human at the event. Go back to sleep zombie girl, shhhh good night."	
5611,"He was clearly fucking with her what an idiot she is to not understand that"	
5612,"lol you guys got called out and cut it out of the video\nLmaooo get fucked."	
5613,"This is what Mastodon use to do on the Grammys for the same reasons, I think."	
5614,"People call crazy what they can't understand"	
5615,"Nothing bizarre here. Whole thing is being over-hyped smh media."	
5616,"Isn't this the belief of the Democrat party.  No this is Masonic teaching. Hahahahhaba"	
5617,"This is seriously what you guys talk about in California? How fucking boring..."	
5618,"BITCH!!! maybe all this entertainment business fucked with YOUR head"	
5619,"This chick is such a moron"	
5620,"Come on everyone! Listen to his words. He's babbling Scientology bullshit."	
5621,"I didnt listen to any word that was weird. Im not even a jim carrey fan. Media sucks."	
5622,"Meeeen... They talk about him like he was crazy or needed help, when in true it's them who lost it. Live Forever Jim! Love ya!"	
5623,"Hahaha E! News are retarded. Love you Jim!"	
5624,"He sounds like Jaden Smith.. but fuck them for shaming Jim Carey"	
5625,"What a condescending shallow cunt and those 3 other cunts laughing.. Yes it wasn't the best place to express those sentiments BUT nothing he said was bizarre or indicated a man who has lost touch with reality if anything it was the opposite and btw he's a comedian so the joke is on y'all. Also why would he do an interview with someone so unprofessional."	
5626,"Lmfao now she's going to go crazy with the comments because she thought everyone was going to be on her side lol"	
5627,"please stop giving energy to the reporter... this is the most publicity she's ever gotten in her life. lets stop doing her favors"	
5628,"He was serious.  Fashion is shallow and the amount of emphasis placed on it is obnoxious.  Art is important but fashion is no longer art."	
5629,"Guy is losing it, just like most Hollywood stars ... duh fuQ is going on in Hollywood?!?"	
5630,"THAT'S THE 3rd FREAKING TIME HE'S TRIED TO EXPOSE HOLLYWIERD AND IT FELL ON DEAF EARS... SMFH... SO SAD, BUT WE HEAR YA, JIM!!!!!!!"	
5631,"She's dumb as rocks."	
5632,"i hope you die bitch"	
5633,"How is this trending with 176 comments.. This is why I hate the trending tab.. Because it's all dumb as fuck"	
5634,"He's the only smart one there."	
5635,"Like me IDGAF about what famous rich people are doing and wearing. Not one fuck."	
5636,"This guy is a real dope"	
5637,"He is above your condescension, obviously."	
5638,"i was a little sad for himmmm... ya know??!"	
5639,"Sad for him? So u did get the message"	
5640,"Who the fuck is this bitch. Idiot"	
5641,"U can see n.hear satan all in him never listen to long to a liar they start confusing u ...its never chamged since the garden of Eden in genesis...jim carrey neeeds to repent its hard to tell who for god these days but to sum it up he is bashing god in.his deceitful way...saying there is no god may the lord turn his own toungue against him and counsel against him to foolishness...go bk to the garden of eden.PEOPLE stsrt over repent romans 10:9 is the way obey gods commandments luv him above all build a relationship with him thru jesus christ he is awesome n.he loves u...never forget that Deuteronomy 28 and 30 ..."	
5642,"His clothes look like they are from the VR related movie Spielberg is making... The Oasis scene..."	
5643,"Hey Lady if by talking seriously  you mean talking about clothes, shoes and gossip then you shouldn't interview people as Jim Carrey. You have two different levels of consciousness and yours is pretty low. All I see in this video is a very intelligent and spiritual man talking to an ignorant woman who cares only about the surface. He should have looked at you the way you've looked at him. But the world's crazy and unfortunately people like you are considered the 'normal ones' and the ones like Jim Carrey are the 'freaks'. Sad story."	
5644,"Terribly rude interviewer... lost a lot of respect for E News after this and won't be watching anymore."	
5645,"I laughed when she said Jim Carrey if you're watching this and want an interview i'm ready..... the fu*k b!tch he doesn't care about you, you're not even the level of his shoes."	
5646,"Everything he said just went over their heads. In a world of ignorance, truth can sound insane. Might i suggest you all squeegee your third eye and realize that ego is a mental delusion, that's what he meant by there is no me. Personality like Celebrity is an abstract, what are we without our names, jobs, social status, etc? A bunch of tetrahedrons A.K.A atoms. That's it. We're star stuff as Carl Sagan put it."	
5647,"THAT was what the fuss was about???  LOL .. its just him messing off!  WTF is all the fuss about?"	
5648,"E news, WTF are you on about.  Jim is on point, you guys are just a fake bullshit media outlet and you're not what the new generation seeks anymore either.  The new generation can pick and choose their media and the younger people have realized that being spoonfed this garbage doesn't help them at all.  They would rather be enlightened.  Your days are outnumbered."	
5649,"Wow, these commentators seem quite proud of their ignorance."	
5650,"You suck ugly lady without a soul and those other bastards!! you people  are 💩👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼🤢"	
5651,"Y'all don't quite understand the law of attraction. Just a bunch of sheep and sheep's opinions."	
5652,"E news is absolutely meaningless. Everything E news represents is meaningless. E news sells empty, consumer driven preconceived notions of a beauty and cultural ideals. Maintaining a distracted audience dedicated to mindless celebrity worship to keep the gears of conformity continuing to rotate further enriching the wealthy and large profit-seeking corporations."	
5653,"He's talking about awareness. He's talking about Advaita, non-dualism, Lila, Tandava, cosmic unfolding. Whichever name you want to give it. Sounds like he's annoyed at the materialism of Hollywood and his mandatory role in these sorts of events. Also sounds like he's having a bit of fun while having to go through the whole rigmarole. Perfectly understandable. Is this actually surprising to anyone? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised :D"

5658,"He is saying some deep shit about how fashion and other pointless celebrity endeavours are worthless and meaningless. He is completely right. And you look at him and talk about him like he a weird crazy man just because he doesn't feed you the predetermined bullshit about clothes that you expected. Fuck E news, Fuck this reporter and Fuck anything else that suppresses free thought. Love Jim Carey for doing this. He's so intelligent in comparison to the people who surround him that they think he's the deluded one. it's nuts"	
5659,"Jim Carrey is RIGHT, u self obsessed, shallow morons. You’re  just unenlightened And in light of losing someone he loves to suicide.....do YOU really matter? NO !!! No, you do not. But you know what matters even less than you? Is fashion. Or what u think is in and fashionable. Don't u know there is an entire world out here that see you all as foolish, laughable and quite silly."	
5660,"Jim Carney is brilliant, He's woken up to the truth about Hollywood and how fake they all are and what their priorities and agenda is , it is all meaningless cause you can't take fashion or mansions or your money with you when you die,  when have you ever seen a Uhaul truck in the back of a hearse ? He's more focused on deeper things now like real life , how we are all one than what is the hottest fashion trend that will die off in a year anyway , He gets it now and Hollywood can't handle it , Don't feel sorry for Jim , feel sorry for those in Hollywood getting sucked into the non sense . Jim is sharper than ever"	
5661,"Not dissing Carey but it sums up Hollyweird.  A fake industry of social climbers filled with fruits and nuts.  The same people that applaud the violence of SJW's in their awards shows while they hand out trophies to each other, slapping each other on the back for being awesomely overpaid for meaningless jobs."

I am hoping for a small difference in your videos though, i am not a content creator so i have zero idea what it would mean monetarily wise but if possible this is my hope. I love the idea and the locations and diversity of the food experiences etc you know what you do, but what i always find myself wanting more of is a bit of you and your partners in crime experiencing a little more of the locales than going straight to the eateries. Not to get all patriotic but Melbourne has been voted most livable city in the world 7 times running, i would have loved to have seen just a little more of you guys experiencing the location as i love your personalities before going straight to shots of happy eating faces. I know its the premise of the show but it seems such an effort to travel so far and not show any footage of you enjoying the actual location as well as the food. Love your personalities and enthusiasm, try an unusual activity everywhere you go before you get to eating :) #BuzzFeedVideo #Worthit # VIDEOFACT   Everyone wants to see more of you guys"

6031,"Soon the coaches will be wired directly to Romo"	
6032,"Been a Cowboy fan since the 70's and when I saw Tony was heading to to broadcast booth I told my wife he will be nothing short of fantastic! If you have ever sat back and just listened to him talk about activity on the field, ebb and flow of act and react things done just before the snap (remember how he'd audible consistently) you'd pick up really fast he's reading the field effortlessly...like a heady coach. Parcellls always said he's smart. But many could not see that. Well, now anyone who appreciates smart football will see for themselves. Here's the downside: now I probably need to get GameRewind because he's calling games in the AFC and I think it's brilliant the way he anticipates the action, so if I wanna see that I'll have to pay for it. I love this guy. The paradigm is about to shift on how to analyze live broadcast football."

6048,"I watched the game and he did a great job commentating"	
6049,"Second note...Amari Cooper only catches difficult passes not the easy ones apparently. If you own him in fantasy trade him for Golden Tate or Doug Baldwin before the rest of your league figures it out as well. atleast those guys will catch the ball and have YAC ( btw i freaking hate Doug Baldwin he's not a #1 receiver)"	
6050,"Dam he knew all this and still couldn't get it done in the field smh haha"	
6051,"That's my quarterback! Wouldn't mind if he came back to be the QB's coach for Dallas."	
6052,"Not a psychic, just an elite QB with fantastic football knowledge. And I'm an eagles fan"	
6053,"He's not psychic, Romo's just an experienced QB. He knows all of these plays."	
6054,"What is this game?"	
6055,"Hope he's part of every raider game! Tony's awesome"

6061,"No homo, but I love Romo"	
6062,"I was skeptical but I thoroughly enjoyed Tony calling this game, got a feeling he is going to be pretty good at this."	
6063,"This is better than the usual, The team that scores more should win the game."	
6064,"go raiders but tony did a really good job in his first broadcasting game"	
6065,"Now that romo is retired, I think we can all agree, despite being brittle, he was a very good qb, he is a stand up guy, and he seems to be a great commentator. Id love to see him call a packer game any day."	
6066,"Do you have express written consent of the nfl?"	
6067,"Still can't compete with the legend Sergio dipp"	
6068,"I think he did good but I wouldnt say the guy said anything that was just jaw-dropping. Gee, Oakland is up and has the ball right now. Probably gonna be a run Rookie kicker makes two 52-yd field goals, gee after seeing him make 2 harder ones earlier 9 yards closer should be more of a centered kick for sure!"	
6069,"This was a topic on a sports radio show today.  They said, and I agree he knows this cuz he's been a QB in the league for over a decade so it's like a cheap parlor trick.  It's cool but it gets old fast.  Kill kill kill is an obvious audible, usually to a run.  It's his job to be analyze why the play happened.  Maybe say they're running left because they saw the safety walking up to the right side.  Not hating.  I like Romo"	
6070,"To bad that didn't win the cowboys a super bowl. Smh."

6092,"Really? Anybody who's watched or played the game can see this stuff. Overloaded to one side = probably gonna run that way.  And for my money, I'd bargain that Romo was fed some of those calls just to increase the hype.  He was that good in the booth but couldn't deliver on the field. But folks are calling him Nostradamus now? Lol"

6188,"Peter or anyone. When you are taking photos in a the city...have you ever come across security and how do you deal with them?"	
6189,"Haha I once went to the Fujitsu Towers in Munich and we were taking pictures of that impressive building when a security guard ran to the closed door right beside us. He waved at us and we thought that he wants to be photographed. So... I took a picture of him. He then opened the door and shouted at us that it is only allowed to shoot on that ground with an permission from the company.  He then forced us to delete the whole sd card with all of our wonderful shots. Lol. Fuck that guy. We then ran away and got amazinh pictures."	
6190,"Wow, this is definitely going to help me get some awesome photos for my design photography assignment. Thanks for sharing."	
6191,"1:21: Resident Evil: Apocalypse :D\nI know, I know... guilty pleasure."	
6192,"Thanks for creating this!! Shooting for yourself and for a client can be totally different but I'm working on changing that too.  It's not an easy field of photography to get into either. I am going to try and discuss all of this as I attempt a 100 days of hustle for the end of the year.  Might love to connect in Toronto at some point around this topic - one day when I have more than 25 subs eh? LOLLLLLLLLL"	
6193,"Thank you very much. Yes please!"	
6194,"Fast growing channel, when i subbed it was just less than 50k and in just few months, boom! 1M+"

6201,"Love it man! Thanks for all the knowledge bro, keep killing it."	
6202,"Great video and content as usual, love your accent too.."	
6203,"You`re so inspiring I hope one day I`ll have opportunity to be a photographer."	
6204,"Love the positive energy that you put out in your videos. It's very inspiring. Keep it up."	
6205,"When I travel, I often use a wheelchair, and have help with the pushing, which means not only do I get a very unique perspective / vantage point to view cities from, but also the time to look around / look up while getting pushed around! It has made for some great shots over the years."	
6206,"Now i understand, thanks man!"	
6207,"It would be the Sydney Harbour Bridge...but it was a boring post card shot...but after watching your inspirational video...i neeeed to revisit this aussie icon and give it the wow factor....thx..."	
6208,"what happened to your hand?"	
6209,"Cheers for the two minutes, mate! Been using your videos to push myself with my own work, and now I've got something completely new to try out on my weekend shoots! \n\nI even bought your presets (and subscribed to LR for the first time) and I'm enjoying playing around with them - I've yet to really use one for a published photo, but I have used them to get some good ideas for how I want to edit an image, and have been getting some great results, so again, cheers!"	
6210,"we all know wat that means"	
6211,"Something to try but the problem is we don't have many buildings around in India."	
6212,"What are u thinking about Iphone X?"

6215,"can you make a video on how you made your intro please"	
6216,"I live in India😕"	
6217,"Forgot about TSE-lenses (Tilt-shift), they are heavily used in architecture photos."	
6218,"Do you know how awesome you are, Pete?"	
6219,"Congrats on the one mil man"	
6220,"Why is there even a dislike button on Pete's vids? Surely we only need Like and Smash it for those who do so desire 	)"

6241,"✌️✌️"	
6242,"I love ur work"	
6243,"Great help!"	
6244,"Sweetssss"	
6245,"'Bwatsapp'"	
6246,"Nice."	
6247,"I hope this wins Best Picture just for the fact that they might bring Tommy up on stage for it"	
6248,"James Franco on being Tommy: I did a bunch of weird shit listening to tapes and watching footage from filming. \nDave on becoming Greg: We(Greg and I) had sushi and talked for 3 hours."	
6249,"Has Tommy ever released a Behind the Scenes of The Room, with all this footage being mentioned?"	
6250,"3:47 marry someone who looks at you like the way he looks at tommy"	
6251,"Random fact: Tommy Wiseau is actually James Franco in the future. He came back in time with his future money to make The Room, and then help with The Disaster Artist, the funds from which he used to make his millions that in the future allowed him to travel back in time to fund The Room and...well, if you've seen any of the Terminator films, you get it..."	
6252,"Franco's mocking and talking down to Tommy.  Greg Sestero does a much better impression of Wiseau in the audio book to be honest."	
6253,"You're tearing me apart Franco"	
6254,"Should’ve gotten Mark Damon...sorry Matt Damon to play Mark"	
6255,"Mark should have played himself,He's barely aged a day"	
6256,"I had no idea Franco was such an unrivalled dickhead."	
6257,"in a few minutes bitch"	
6258,"This is a great insight from the interview, very dense, their chemistry is so energetic, and Franco seems most mature, sincere and happy. He diffused Tommy's nervousness so easily, it's like he knows him better than Tommy does. No doubt that they did justice to the characters."	
6259,"I really don't get why people hate James Franco. He makes odd career choices sometimes with all his indie shit but he seems like a really great guy... loving the deuce and can't wait for this"	
6260,"Tommy Looks Like he just got out of a hospital on Guerrero Street"	
6261,"I like Tommy and think Franco's a dickhead but doesn't Tommy seem coked up?"	
6262,"Greg is still hot as fuck."	
6263,"I'm looking forward to this movie. It doesn't look they're just making fun of him, it's seems to have a lot of heart. I hope it delivers"	
6264,"Does Tommy knows that he's horrible?"	
6265,"I'm pretty sure Greg could've played Greg. He still looks very young"	
6266,"Tommy Wiseau makes James Franco look, for a lack of a better word, normal?"	
6267,"4:37 come on Franco why have to put him on the spot like that? LMAO"	
6268,"James Franco is really taking some leg space"	
6269,"Look at James man spreading"	
6270,"Feels weird listening to wiseau without his voice sounding over dubbed like in the movie"	
6271,"Franco's legs are wide open AF everyone else looks awkward."	
6272,"The way the camera movement...I really like it!\nThe camera movement? The camera don't move.\n\nClassic Wiseau moment right there! :D"	
6273,"Why is he doing his voice at him!?"	
6274,"James is half way stuck in the ascent"	
6275,"James Franco imitates that way Tommy speaks at times"	
6276,"Franco can't help talking like Tommy"	
6277,"James is honestly sort of a douche in this interview, you can tell Tommy is just going with the flow, but is probably a little pissed. Either way I still have to see this film.👍😂"	
6278,"It looks like he's right there but we all know Tommy Wiseau is on another planet."	
6279,"Here it is... you want to watch... the definitive critique of The Room as Oedipus Rex. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs20YlgvvYk"	
6280,"Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!"	
6281,"Tommy speaks so funny😅 that end omg.. my favourite part is the swimming pool scene\nReally? Its so random\nYeah I like it. I like the camera movement in there\nCamera movement? The camera doesn't move.. 😂"	
6282,"James is a fucking douche"	
6283,"granted I've still never seen The Room (I definitely will before I see this), but is Wiseau in just like an epic case of denial that he made what's regarded as one of the worst films ever? Does he even realize people think that? or he does, but he genuinely believes deep in his heart that EVERYONE is wrong and it's a quality film and he's a good actor?"	
6284,"I'm so happy that Tommy feel joy about this film been made!"	
6285,"Tommy might have a little bit of dementia."	
6286,"Tommy is such a lovely guy"	
6287,"Why is there spit on Tommy's chin"	
6288,"I know he has a cameo, he should be the flower shop worker"	
6289,"Having watch the trailers, I have to say that Franco pretty much nailed Tommy's persona"	
6290,"Tommy can't fit on the couch."	
6291,"Franco has an epic man-spread. Taking up half the couch"	
6292,"Stereograms of Wealth\nMatrix of Wealth\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira\nStereograms to order\nPersonalized stereograms"	
6293,"Wow. Tommy Wiseau actually saw James Franco in Sonny. That's dedication. lol"	
6294,"The camera don't move. LOL"	
6295,"Its so wierd how James still cant get away from the voice of Tommy, just listen to some of the sentences and words he use in this interview :D"	
6296,"It's fucking wholesome and adorable, this video. Franco is still talking like Wiseau. Waaat. that's so rahndom"	
6297,"I don't know if I have ever loved anyone as much as I love Tommy Wiseau."	
6298,"I do love how Franco isn't taking any of Tommy's shit.  I mean, look at his legs.  He's all spread out and Tommy is crammed into the side there.  Tommy couldn't have liked that."	
6299,"It's nice to see Tommy has seemingly warmed up to the guys and the press for this film. At the start it was so obvious he didn't like it and didn't want to be there."	
6300,"Tommy seems like a decent guy and its pretty awesome theyre all friends now"	
6301,"Tommy's being such a good sport about this."	
6302,"I've never seen Tommy Wiseau this normal, it's unusual. He's usually saying nonsense."	
6303,"Franco is talking to Wiseau in his native tongue lmao"	
6304,"I love how Tommy has such weird answers for everything here I now understand why he thought the room was a good idea"	
6305,"I would kill to see the behind the scenes footage that Markus shot."	
6306,"James is still subtly talking like Tommy."	
6307,"Super excited for the movie but it's still kind of sad to see Tommy involved in this. I still thinks he believes that his art is good. I get he's fearless and HE is interesting, but his art is NOT good . I really don't think he gets that diaster artist is making fun of his art, not celebrating it. It's like the kid who has a sign on his back and everyone is looking at him but he doesn't get why."	
6308,"I love how Tommy actually wants this movie to be made and is just loving every second of it XD"	
6309,"Wow, this is almost akin to Windy City Heat."	
6310,"Tommy thinks a handsome guy like James Franco is perfect because in his mind that's what he looks like."	
6311,"Lets just say agreeing with franco moved him.......TO A BIGGER HOUSE"	
6312,"The Like to Dislike ratio for this video is one of the best I've ever seen."	
6313,"please release it today!!!"	
6314,"Tommy is an absolute treasure."	
6315,"Is tommy like proud of his disaster? Like this movie is making fun of him"	
6316,"Franco drops his articles of speech to gain street cred with Tommy"	
6317,"Tommy Wiseau still thinks this is all absolutely serious. He thinks they praise his movie thats why they did a movie based on how the Tommy Wiseaus movie was made. lol... dont know what to think honestly."	
6318,"Franco is going to be talking like Tommy for years after doing it for so long. When he talks to Tommy, his sentence structure changes to be just like Tommy's."	
6319,"I don't get it....is this guy like Sasha Borat?? Lolol"	
6320,"Why is Tommy's chin so wet, is he drooling?"	
6321,"Tommy's like this Bob Dylan-esque rock star now. To me, The Disaster Artist is a much more lyrical title than 'I'm Not There'. Yet Dylan's career is more 'The Disaster Artist' in terms of making a name for himself. And Tommy's more the 'I'm Not There' in that he has this coolness that removes himself from his bad movie. More mystique about Tommy than Bob I'd say - whether rightfully or wrongly, that's the paradox."	
6322,"Calling it now , it will win an oscar and Wiseau will be given the oscar. It will be amazing"	
6323,"This is so fucking awkward 😂😂😂"	
6324,"Also, James Franco close your god damn legs and give that poor old man some god damn room!"	
6325,"Greg is radiant. My god why didn't they cast him in the film as Greg?"	
6326,"His hair looks like a donut."	
6327,"Franco should've been dressed like Tommy lol"	
6328,"So great"	
6329,"Hah hah Hah"	
6330,"Why isn't Greg talking?"	
6331,"Directed by Nicholas cage..."	
6332,"This is money!"	
6333,"Franco is manspreading"	
6334,"That is some indulging manspread"	
6335,"Franco looks normal  compared to tommy lol."	
6336,"Dave looks sooo tiny"	
6337,"tommys lookin like michael jackson rn"	
6338,"watevur move on next question."	
6339,"Oh hi, Marcus."	
6340,"Stop ganging up on me 😂😂😂"	
6341,"wtf with Franco manspreading, poor Tommy... close your legs stupidaaaaassss"	
6342,"The Room came out 15 years ago and Tommy hasnt improved his English at all. haha"	
6343,"SØREN PILMARK !!!! Hey every Danish person watching, LOOK, IT'S SØREN PILMARK :D"	
6344,"The original Mark was supposed to be black."	
6345,"After seeing The Room and read The Disaster Artist, it is so good to see Tommy, finally on that level. Hanging ou with actual Hollyood stars."	
6346,"The worse artist playing the worse artist! Spot on!"	
6347,"Graduation and late registration his best albums"	
6348,"Don't act like I never told ya"	
6349,"808's changed music more tho"	
6350,"Anyone weird enough to like fish dicks is bound to be considered eccentric thus genius by the average person.\nAlso, no genius would marry a Kardashian or leave an insurmountable volume of shit that comes out of his mouth aka brain."	
6351,"Nawll this the real Kanye west back in the days the one I loved now he then branched off went from Jesus walk with me to thinking his God nooooooo wrong move praying for u brother 🙏🙏🙏🙏"	
6352,"High School Train Rides .. Good Ol Days.. Damn, we all get old before you know it.."	
6353,"Glad to see Ye finally getting the recognition for his greatness that he deserves."	
6354,"Champion is my most favorite song"	
6355,"I just don't get this music at all."	
6356,"I fucking love this album"	
6357,"FINALLY GENIUS IS TRENDING. And where the hell is Letty we're annoyed now :("	
6358,"I love this album and enjoyed the video but I didn't catch the part where they described how music was changed by it."	
6359,"Scrollin through these comments and not one mentions Champion! Easily one of Kanye's most underrated songs damn"	
6360,"The best Kanye album in my opinion."	
6361,"Get the fuck out of here ....Changed music my fuckin Ass....Kanye is a piece of shit. Hip Hop is Bullshit. Rap is mindless bullshit. Take away auto-tune. Take  away Lyrics about violence , money, and whores.....wtf are u left with.....NOTHING!!!!"	
6362,"Would the Kayne of the past think of the Kayne of today has having gone south in his career and mental health?"	
6363,"Kanye hasn't made a good song since College Drop out. He stinks now. Half retarded because of Kardashian Syndrome"	
6364,"I'll stick to Pac and all the old shit"	
6365,"No college dropout changed music. Graduation adapted to change into the music that you here today. But college dropout was the catalyst to everything."	
6366,"This change anything he is just another nigger"	
6367,"There's a lot of Kanye dick riders here that obviously know nothing about hip hop"	
6368,"No it didn't"	
6369,"Am i the only one who like Barry Bonds ?"	
6370,"Changed music??? Give me a break, give one solid example of how it changed music."	
6371,"Unfortunately Kanye and Wayne different versions of hip hope and rap has lead to the mumble crap we see today with nothing but beats and autotune carrying entire wongs"	
6372,"The dude is a musical genius, i just wish he wasnt an egotistical, autistic, arrogant piece of shit human being yah know?"	
6373,"Does anyone else notice Kanye's jacket in the vid look like the black parade jackets"	
6374,"Just gonna say it's refreshing to see a YouTube comment section where people aren't shitting on Kanye. Y'all wavy."	
6375,"This is a nice format! Can Genius have a channel for rock & metal?"	
6376,"lmao when's he gonna get lil wayne to play guitar on his album?"	
6377,"I know God put you infront of me .How the hell could you front on me ?!!"	
6378,"i was lowkey sad when it ended hahaha i was interested in what they had to say for post graduation"	
6379,"I have problem choosing wether Graduation or 808 and Heartbreaks to be my favorite album"	
6380,"Thank you for this. Thank Kanye for all of this."	
6381,"I miss the old kanye\nChop up the beats kanye."

6383,"My favorites are Champion and Glory. Stronger is overrated"	
6384,"Genius has a YouTube channel?? How did I not know this before today! Subscribed 🎶❤️"	
6385,"everything i'm not made me everything i am 🤘🏻"	
6386,"I think the biggest effect Kanye West ever had on my life was that he showed me there was in fact, actually one person on this earth I actually despise more than Taylor Swift. Then Beyonce just kinda shrugged him off and congratulated Taylor Swift. I see why so many people like Beyonce, she is a class act. Still don't get why so many like the other 2 though..."	
6387,"I bought a CD back in 2007 for the cover and kept it for the music."	
6388,"I wanna see one of this for every album, specially for mldtf"	
6389,"I thought thay meant that they played his music at an Graduation...."	
6390,"Forget the new kanye i need old kanye"

6417,"It’s so true"	
6418,"Great way to see if you can talk music with someone. Ask them if they think Kanye West is one of the greats artist of our time. If they say no dont talk to them LOL"	
6419,"Can't tell me nothing and champion... Middle school jams"	
6420,"Say what you want about Ye but I stan him HAAAARD"	
6421,"kanye always seems to impress me, because you go back to any other album from 07 you can clearly hear the age of it. graduation isn't that way. same for 808's."	
6422,"the greatest artist of the 21st century"	
6423,"For the 2010s, the top 5 most influential and culture changing albums/projects in no particular order are My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Take Care, House of Balloons, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and Channel Orange. Changed music as a whole."

6427,"Kanye West is the greatest ARTIST of the 21st century"	
6428,"Kanye was the core of hip hop in the 2000s. His creativity literally changed the game. Like, what fucking rapper in 2007 would collab with Chris Martin? All his songs on Graduation are GOLD for that time"	
6429,"Kanye West is the goat and there's no dispute"	
6430,"When this album came out, it never left my car's CD player for over 7 months. The fact that he made the beats made the songs more appreciative."	
6431,"Man that album was awesome"	
6432,"Everyone always ignores The Glory, that was my favorite song in the album."

6435,"yes he is extremely talented, but he doesn't have to be so smug about it. I just wish he would just tone down his narcissistic tendencies and just be himself for a change. I don't. hate Kanye West for I am a secretly a huge fan of  his music."	
6436,"One of my favorite albums definitely a classic ‼️‼️‼️ hes the 🐐  GOAT ... lyrically top 5"	
6437,"I listen to all that trap shit now days. But it's something special when I can listen to a bunch of bull shit and the only real hip hop I have on my phone is Kanye West albums all the way up to run away. His messages in his songs are so real man. I'm a truck driver, so I'll put it on shuffle and my whole day will change emotionally. Also I have Lauren Hill, Eryka Badu, some floetry, etc.... I love good music. But now days it's dying to me."	
6438,"Graduation is still my favorite Kanye album...amazing front to back"

6448,"Good job Apple... you have played the oldest trick in the salesman's book. Create an alternative phone thats more  special, more expensive, more exclusive, more Apple vs an already outdated looking Iphone 8. That way all the technologically impaired, trend following sheep will have no choice but to pay 1K for a cellphone in order to remain relevant in within their pathetic social circles. It's all about the brand."

6484,"Aww man, I wanted it to escalate higher... Like it thought he would accidentally tie his hands together, or try to use an industrial staple gun with the shoe on his foot and start bleeding and have a cast, and then try to put the shoe over the cast. Or rip the laces and try to use a bunch of rope from the garage to tie the shoe. Or use the duct tape but put it sticky side out and get it stuck to everything in the house, forcing him to make a shoe tying machine that goes bazerk and ties everything in his house into bows... Or something on that level..."

6676,"Funny how? Like I'm a clown, I amuse you? They shoulda gotten Joe Pesci to play Pennywise. They coulda had him beat some kid to death with a shinebox."	
6677,"I wish she could make a movie, so I can try really, really hard to make a sarcastic video about it......"	
6678,"Ok, this is my favorite Jenny video by a wide margin. Her, I guess you'd call it trademark almost bored tone made describing a killer clown the funniest thing I'm likely to watch today. It's 7am and I've already hit my funny peak."	
6679,"From this movie, I learned that Pennywise was an actual clown that died in a previous Derry incident. \nIT probably just finds this form more universally fear inducing than the other forms he uses. \nI expect when he lets people get away it's because he wants to let the fear simmer for a bit. \nAlso the key to defeating him is friendship, like most of life's problems. \nhttps://pics.me.me/doubt-2-youre-right-i-cant-do-it-you-cant-20047874.png\nStephen King's IT: Friendship is Magic."

6685,"what the hell was that the vietnam wall memorial for the ending ?\nwtf was that x)"	
6686,"What are you afraid of Jenny?"	
6687,"I heard this theory that he’s a clown because “pennywise” the identity, is of a serial killer like John Wayne gasey in that universe. Because all of the forms he takes are of preexisting entities, like Beverly’s Dad or the lumberjack statue or the flute painting or Georgie"	
6688,"For once, I completely agree with this lady. Pennywise was not scary, and IT was very disappointing."	
6689,"Where is the giant porg!?"	
6690,"The sausagefest that is your patreon account is always the best piece of comedy in your videos"	
6691,"What if he went across monkey bars whilst upside down... like all gravity defying like?"	
6692,"So, like a crocodile, Pennywise is an ambush predator. 	)"
6693,"You're very pretty in glasses"	
6694,"You're so pretty."	
6695,"Just admit to us that you like being a clown haha, I can imagine him sitting there with a sad clown face when they say that to him."	
6696,"my god what happened to your porg! it shrunk!"	
6697,"Pennywise was scared of the Losers because he knew they had the power to kill him if they stuck together, so he wanted Henry to kill some of them first"	
6698,"My goodness you are attractive"	
6699,"as glad as i was when you went over to screen junkies just in hopes you'd make some money off your work, these are by far you best videos.  millennial falcon is great but i'm interested in hearing what you have to say on more than the one topic."	
6700,"3:13 He can dance if he wants to.  He can leave his friends behind.  Because his friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine.\n\n*safety dances out of the comment section*"	
6701,"I am so glad you did a video about the film! I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie."	
6702,"You know nothing of It beep beep Richie is what they say to Richie to shut up. He feeds on fear. And he likes scared children he says they taste better scared. He wants to scare them to eat them but he made a mistake of letting them live longer he thaught he could eat scare them more so that they would taste better"	
6703,"I never cared for Pennywise the band"	
6704,"With the final confrontation with Pennywise they should have played a song from Queen."	
6705,"I've always felt that the deadites from the Evil Dead franchise feed off of fear as well, that to them it's a kind of art. Sometimes killing people is necessary for creating that fear, but if you watch enough Evil Dead stuff you start to realize that they take relatively few opportunities to actually kill.\n\nOff-topic, but whatever. I'm drunk."	
6706,"Mostly true lol, but for the first one he wasn't trying to catch him, he was trying to scare him because to him the more afraid they are the better they taste. That's also why he takes his time since hes trying to build up how scared they are. Funny video though"	
6707,"You're braver than I. I was not going to watch a killer clown movie."	
6708,"Hey. Jenny. You. Are. Beautiful. And. Clever. :)"	
6709,"4:10 o my goodness i didnt even think in that scene that way, now thats the only way ill think of it now. I HATE U FOR THIS"	
6710,"The clown, not the punk rock band"	
6711,"A big spider huh....thats an interesting notion 	]"
6712,"Why is that porg so tiny?!"	
6713,"Nah, penny wise says beep beep to Richie as a reference to the book. The kids used beep beep as an indicator for Richie to stop running his mouth yeah?"	
6714,"I'm sorry—that was a great video—but the camera wasn't set right."	
6715,"Jennys hair looks like she got shes all that-ed right before she started shooting where she took off her glasses and shook down her hair in slowmo....but then couldnt see so she had to put the glasses back on"	
6716,"i always figured that the more fear a kid experiences the more the fear flavor builds inside them. Like how adrenaline makes animals taste gamey."	
6717,"I was just picturing Pennywise telling the Crimson King he was going to take the form of a Clown."	
6718,"Do more stars wars erotica fan fiction."	
6719,"Ok well now I feel like a total idiot for liking the movie. Thanks Jenny."	
6720,"I was with It, more or less, right up to the point where the kids locate the house and decide to wander in and tackle the supernatural killer monster with, uh... friendship? Stern disapproval? I guess they thought they'd prove it was real by having it tear them all to shreds. I found it tough to y'know, BUY IN after that point. Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even!"	
6721,"it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular. At the end of the comedian's jokes, they would beep a horn, similar to the 'drumroll' that we associate with the end of jokes on modern stand up comedy routines. So the beep beep richie part was basically saying, Ok richie, joke's over!"	
6722,"I love your analyses, but damnit don't ruin IT for me with your logic lol"	
6723,"In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster."	
6724,"There really was no rhyme or reason to his tactics. The only consistency was him ending a scene as a clown."	
6725,"YES Jenny I'm so glad you made a video about this"	
6726,"holy fuck was she bit in the face by a dog when she was a kid or something?"	
6727,"I don't think it was pennywise but the actor who had never seen or heard of clowns before accepting the role. Thanks in part to the 1990s big tobacco cases that banned phillip morris from promoting clowns to children and the truth about clowns campaign."	
6728,"Never trust a man with large shoes.. \n\n\n.. my dad put on his size 11's and walked out on us"	
6729,"Look, someone who didn't read the book. How could this very simple concept of a movie elude you? My 9 year old kept up, I thought you were intelligent... Or is that just what you keep wanting us to think that? Also, 42 percent of people are afraid of clowns. And pennywise got greedy and wanted all those kids and he built up their fear for too long. Clearly to his down fall... Do you even pay attention to the movies you watch or just pick up shit you wanna bitch about to be a hipster?"	
6730,"Hey! This was fun. I'm curious, did you enjoy the movie?"	
6731,"Honestly, if I hadn't read the book and had only seen the movie, I wouldn't give a shit about who the kids were and what happened to them. Like the movie was 2 hours long and we barely learned anything about our main characters."	
6732,"Just watched the 90s version.  The talking head in the fridge, shaking and yelling WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE! was a reoccurring thing in my childhood nightmares.  Looking forward to the new film."	
6733,"Soooooo, did you like it?"	
6734,"YES! My biggest problem with most horror movies is how illogically the murderers behave. Why would you toy with your victims in a way that implies there is an audience watching? Unless......are the monsters aware of us, the moviegoers? Is Pennywise's food actually our approval as the audience? Dun dun dun!!!"	
6735,"Deadpan, deeply perceptive, ironic, hilarious and very clever. Not sure if we deserve you, Jenny (meant in a good way)."	
6736,"This movie was great though"	
6737,"What are you looking for is reference to which pill was Eddie looking for."	
6738,"I'm new here"	
6739,"I thought you were going to talk about punk rock. Gotta be honest, I'm a little disappointed. :("

6876,"So sad these incredible actresses were wasted on a mediocre script. Dave and Dan don't deserve them."	
6877,"the cersei acting was so good, the little moment when she ask: why did you do that? and then shes face change completely to a sentimental face and than she realize that shes losing control and position and recover herself with that revenge face again"

6882,"How do you watch full episodes in the UK?"	
6883,"OH NO! Dorne which was never conquered by the Targaryens and has one of the biggest army will now retaliate. Oh wait,  the tv show writers are too dumb to replicate a complex multilayered story.  The rest of the world doesn't exist anymore,  only a handful of characters and they're plot lines."

6905,"Lena Headey makes Cersei one of the scariest villainesses, or should I say, lionesses in film history."	
6906,"Yeah, this scene was brilliant and all, but who the heck rules in Dorne now???"

6910,"I was sad they died because bronn never got that bad pussy"	
6911,"So it's all fluffing around the actors before shooting, but after the shoot you all boot off home and leave them stuck in their chains. Tisk tisk."	
6912,"Why is no one bringing us that there is still a huge army is Dorne that is not being used?? And surly someone was left in charge to run down while it's leaders were away, why can't the person(s) running dorne just send their army to join daenerys so long as she agrees to free to sand snakes + where the hell is the rest of the Tyrell army!?!"

6919,"I hope yall realize how shit and unworthy of our money this season was. Like its been going down hill but to kill the sand snakes without giving them a proper story was fucked up. Cant wait to pirate season 8"

6924,"Cersei is way more interesting than Dany"	
6925,"0:29 I think they used a different take in the show, you could hear the desperation and almost a sense of innocence in Lena's voice in the final take."	
6926,"0:00 looks like something you can get from the dark web"	
6927,"She is bad ass villain"	
6928,"I empathized with Cersei because all she did was for her children. I think she actually considered them more like extentions of herself. When they died, every excuse disappeared. She's pretty much sane. She had done stupid things, and now she's suddenly smart. It's because she didn't use her brains when she had children. Now she uses them. She's perfectly fine, and yet she's as cruel as before. I don't empathize with her anymore. Die, bitch! (Not triggered😂)"

6937,"It was honestly a breathtaking scene. So well done. Thank you to the actresses and crew"	
6938,"i'm not gonna lie...i was shitting myself during this episode, Oberyns death freaked the fuck out of me and i was expecting more of the same in this scene. Easily one of the most intense pieces of TV i've seen in a while"	
6939,"As much I absolutely loved to see Ellaria finally get her much deserved dose of Karma from Cersei & as much as I totally loved seeing Euron butcher the other 2 Sand Snakes during the Greyjoy naval battle, I was really sad to see Tyene set up to die the way she did in Cersei's dungeons as she was the only Sand Snake that I did like even though she fucking killed badass Areo Hotah by stabbing him in the back which was lame. I'm still going to miss Tyene, definitely not going to miss Ellaria & her other daughters!!!\n\nI really hope that Ellaria realizes that thanks to her actions she has effectively rendered the once mighty House Martell, the house of her very own great love, completely & utterly extinct!!!\n\nOberyn may've been cocky & arrogant & vengeful but he was also very firmly against the idea of punishing children for the sins of their parents & he never would've allowed Ellaria to murder poor Myrcella!!!"

I set the bixpy app to factory reset which would be its state before i activated it, and now every so often within a longer interval of seconds the phone will wake itself up as if im pressing the power button. This even happens when i shut it down and its charging, i dont press the button yet the screen will wake up to show the percentage when its off or go to the screen before you unlock the phone while its on. What do you think the problem is? i dont know if its taxing on the battery when its on and it wakes the screen up but its rather annoying"

7334,"I dropped my S8 just like the first test in your video but on a wooden floor and ended up with a broken screen. Not only that, I was disappointed when I noticed scratches on the screen just after a couple of weeks of buying the phone and I realised later that they're caused by plastic rounded object in my pocket where I used to carry my phone. I had an S4 before I buy the S8 and I've used it for more than 3 years and till now it has no noticable scraches on the screen even that I used it the same way as I use the S8."

Pulling out of the pocket and landing on a raised floor with ring screen protector shouldn't cause this much problems. Ceramic, clear front screens and plastic (damn easy scratching) are the only acceptable future thus far. 1000 dollars ruined because it gets caught on your pocket (or anything) shouldn't require a new screen.

The city should of changed massive codes in the 80s and stopped people from putting these shacks ups. \n\nI hope they realize a house in Florida should mean concrete walls and slab roof all reinforced with rebar and massive shutters on all windows and doors. \nJust like a cabin in Alaska is set up for major winters a house in a hurricane state should be set up for just that.

7387,"I hope you all aren't serious where's the damage it was so hyped try those being your homes. Your neighborhood. Let's see a storm hit your house and destroy it. Just a regular thunderstorm that didn't have any hype. Lightning hits a tree and boom house is destroyed. You can enjoy fixing your house if you didn't die and not have to worry about that pesky hype"	
7388,"FAKE NEWS ALERT! I live down here and the damage is minimal this was a cat 2 storm cat 1 up here in Sarasota, these pictures are of a mobile home park that was built below flood surge level... this is common in Florida. Most of these parks are grandfathered in for zoning so you live there at your own risk but no one can get flood or wind insurance. Most of the residential areas that are built to Zone 13' are fine in any storm, that includes everything built in the last 20 or so years. Florida is beautiful and clean today because mother nature knows best... and please  play some Jimmy Buffett when showing these"	
7389,"I'm confused on why they are only showing mobile home parks....this is Naples, full of million dollar homes. SMH.I used to live there, my mother was there during the storm, show some real Naples.."	
7390,"Are those supposed to be houses or chicken coops?"	
7391,"They should design different types of housing for areas where floods can happen. I'm sure scientists and engineers can think of something better than what private construction companies are doing.\nJust like in a heavy tornado region it would likely make sense to live in domes rather than cubes.\nIt's either this or just stop living in hazardous regions."

7632,"I thought he was gay, when he walked on the scene. Knowing that sexuality is more fluid, I still think he's gay/queer-- regardless of how he identifies. However, I respect his identity. That is how I feel. As for Portia, I would have never guessed she was bisexual. \nRegardless, my assumption was he was on the LBGT+ spectrum. \nAlso, I think him wearing that suit, was a give away. He almost seemed uncomfortable in it. It was look big, and didn't seem to fit who he is.\n\nAND, and the way they parted ways-- they should have been instant BFFs. I wanted them to walk out together singing the theme song to Golden Girls!!"	
7633,"I FREAKING EXPLODED WHEN HE SAID PENTATONIX THEY ARE NY LIFE YES I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN ALREADY DANG COME GET ME BOO"

7650,"LOVELY JUST LOVELY 💙I JUST REALLY ENJOYED 💯There conversation with each other."	
7651,"Okay so from a guys perspective - from the UK. Where we say everything exactly how it is and to the point. Not like our American cousins who sugar coat the truth in order not to offend...\n\nI feel as though this could of went down a whole other way, if the guy had given off more of a manly vibe about him. He didn't exactly come across like he either knew what he was supposed to be doing (i.e. naive in dating) or that he just came across as more feminine. Things such as little gestures like head shaking when saying beyoncé and that whole ohh hey gurl ...vibe. Probably instantly put her off. As for her... Well he wasn't exactly trying to find compatibility in terms of sexual connection so the whole thing seemed doomed from the early stages, for me.\n\nThat's just what you guys would call throwing my 2 cents worth in..."

Then his master came looking for him. The Prophet said: 'Sell him to me,' and he bought him for two black slaves.

You don't typically deal with uncompressed lossless files (e.g. bmp, the netpbm formats, raw images), but rather png (more or less row by row zip compression), gif (lossless if you fit the 256 color palette) or other lossless images."

7751,"the animating in this was so smooth!"	
7752,"Great and very interesting as always!"	
7753,"wouldn't the theoretically best method be to use a tree that used, not just letters, but sequences longer than individual digits? such as 2-digits, or even whole words (Each of which would be followed by a space, essentially removing the need for the space to be in the huffman tree). such as the 200 most frequently used words in a novel + individual letters in order to assemble those that don't fall under the top 200? i'm betting this is, indeed, how more advanced implementations of huffman's coding works."

7756,"An easy trick is to build the tree dynamically. Forinstance,  for 'wicky wild wild', make a tree of all letters with frequency set to 0, encode 'w', rebuild tree for 'w' with frequency 1, encode 'i', rebuild tree for 'i' with frequency 1, and so on. Encoder and decoder read the letters in the same order, produce the same tree."

7791,"These series are great, Tom. You have a knack for explaining complicated concepts intuitively without losing what's important. Do you use any unconventional techniques for understanding the concepts deeply enough to capture the gist of them like this? My current strategy is reading and trying to incorporate the concept in my current knowledge base, but it usually takes 2-3 readings to do."

You have the best content on this entire platform, both in subject matter and quality."	
7797,"... send the wrong worms. Ha! I see what you did there!"	
7798,"And I can apply Huffman to save the Huffman tree, and the Huffman code, or again. So actually  we are just trading space for work, right? Or storing information into work? That's cool. Maybe it's what the universe is doing right now, unveiling its stored  Huffman code through chemical reactions."	
7799,"Yeah, cool stuff. I'll just keep using my golang gzip/(whatever your preference is) library since I'm trusting scientists to do this for me. Seriously, I'm too busy actually building things irl to re-invent the wheel just for fun."

7839,"not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame."

7858,"When the Romans conquered Sparta and its lands, were the Spartans forced to live by the Roman law/customs? Or did they keep up (part) of their own culture?\nGreat video btw, loads of information	 but packed clean and clear. Well done."
7859,"the spartans had slaves that allowed the entire population to live like aristocracy and devote their time to war. We have so much technology that much of what is needed to run a society is done my machines overseen by a few people. We could use this to shorten the average work week to something like ten hours but capitalism lives off growth and would never allow this. there will always be new jobs until we implement a universal basic income. we could be the new spartans. we could live like kings off the fruits of our technology. sure, some work still needs to be done but not as much as is currently being done. 60% of people in britain believe their job is actually unnecessary.\n\nwhen self driving cars take all the jobs from truck drivers and taxi drivers, capitalism will create new jobs for them or leave them unemployed and in poverty. what if instead we realised that we have less work to do as a society and the same amount of people. implement a UBI and allow people to work less. \n\nhumanity has pushed the frontiers of science and technology for thousands of years. its time to relax and live off the fruits of our labour.\n\nif you ask people what they would do with a universal basic income nearly everyone has an idea of something productive they would do. maybe theyd do charity work or start a business or study. if you ask people what other people would do with a UBI, nearly everyone responds the same theyd just spend it on cigarettes and alcohol. theyre wrong.\n\nCapitalism is not the future and communism is not the only alternative. the time is ripe for a UBI"

7870,"The Spartan decline is due to the Thebans under Epaminondas freeing the helots of messania from their captive state. The Thebans decisively defeated the spartans at the battle of Leuctra, and marched on into their heartlands. While not being able to conquer Sparta itself, Epaminondas moved into Messenia and freed the helots there. This was a third of Sparta's land, and about half of the helot population. To make sure the Messenians would remain a free people he rebuild the city of Messene, and with it build some of the strongest fortifications in all of Greece.\n\nWhile Epaminondas died a few years later and Thebe as a major power with him, the Spartans never recovered from this defeat. It meant that the Spartans could no longer field there entire male population as an army, for the simple reason that there were not enough helots to feed and supply them. It was also a huge moral defeat, as both the Spartans as the rest of the Greeks no longer saw the Spartan army as invincible. It has to be remembered that the massive loss of land counts for much as well. For example the 'heiresses' could no longer uphold their wealth if a third of their land or more was suddenly no longer in their possesion. This meant that not only did the spartans lose their ability to field a massive army, they also lost the power to fund it.\n\nWhile this does not completely account for the MASSIVE loss in influence and manpower, it  was without a doubt the start of the decline. It was probably, as you said, that they were not willing to change their ways after losing half of their helot/worker population"	
7871,"ALL THE GREEKS JOINED ALEXANDER THE GREAT,ONLY THE SPARTANS STAYED BEHIND FOR FRAPE!!!\n\nHORIS LOGIA!!!"	
7872,"Wasn't there a class of non-citizen freemen who lived in the Spartan lands? If I remember correctly they mainly did the jobs that were seen as above the Helots but beneath the Spartans proper, such as a good deal of the merchant work, as well as serving in the army if called upon. In fact if my memory of my undergraduate reading doesn't fail me it was actually possible for these freemen to be elevated into full Spartanhood under very special conditions and with the support of a Spartan citizen."

7875,"22:20 \n\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\n\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \n\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \n\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\n\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\n\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \n\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure."	
7876,"Wow, they sound like they have a pretty Democratic system."	
7877,"Waiting forever for another one of his videos, good lord I love them :)"	
7878,"Sounds like the Gerousia were kinda detrimental to the whole thing."	
7879,"I've seen an in-depth historian's account on the Spartan mythos that debunks a lot of their image as the dominant Greek military power.  Long story short, tales of the Battle of Thermopylae became overblown propaganda, even corrupting the perceptions of Sparta pre-Persian invasion.  It wasn't until much later that Sparta got a strong, sophisticated military, perhaps just from trying to live up to their new reputation.  Self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.  Only really relevant to the opening of this vid.  As always, thanks for all this fascinating info!"

7885,"It didn't help when the Spartans killed their babies to see if they were perfect or not."

7890,"You had no business dismissing Aristotle for criticizing extreme wealth and luxury. He was totally right - and pretty much all the other ancient philosophers have the same criticisms of the elites of their societies. Great video otherwise, but that one point was surprisingly stupid."	
7891,"Firstly, in the From Democrats to Kings, Michael Scott narrates a lot of battles throughout the V and IV B.C centuries and also how warfare evolved to something more killing efficient. I don't remember if it was him or someone who was debating on the specific topic of Sparta's declining military prowes, but it was a point that the continous loss of men able to fight and also the inability for the Spartans to change that was responsable for it's eventual decline. I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\n\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks? Ha! I will see myself out."	
7892,"Their was nothing glorious about Sparta they were a dictatorship fascism slave society, it was doomed to fail."

7900,"One reason for their decline may be that citizenship was hereditary, and that one punishment for lawbreaking was loss of citizenship.  Whether a convicted man and his descendants became Helots, I don't know, but he & his were barred from military service. Over time, then, the pool of recruits simply dried up.  Or so I've read...."

Seems to like puns, has a mechanical pencil collection, and names his socks (after Dark Horse comic book characters). Owns an Atari 2600 and brags about it to strangers.  Worst that could happen: Engineer. And gay. And better than you.\n3. First time you met, he went in for the quick-hug, as if you were close friends. And then sniffed your hair. Although he doesn't stare at your chest, which is nice, he does stare at your feet. And said your toes are adorable.  Has a scraggly soul patch. Second-worst that could happen: He is confusing you for a girl he saw on Chaturbate. Actual worst that could happen: You are the girl he saw on Chaturbate.\n4.  You keep running into him at improbable places and times. He acts like he doesn't see you, but gets nervous and runs away when you call him out. You are suspicious that he is a stalker. Worst that could happen: it turns out he's not a stalker, and those were just coincidences. Now you're bummed because you feel like maybe you aren't good enough to stalk.\n5. He has a popular YouTube channel. You think it involves cats. Or cooking. Or cooking for cats. Whatever it is, he has a warehouse full of something called merch, which you think may be some sort of narcotic. Possibly for cats. He brags about his subs and says that he is way more interesting than a Pootie-Pie, whatever the f*ck that means. Worst that could happen: you end up being a groupie for team 10."

Because we're so generous and care about our community, we're offering money to those affected.  Only condition is that you waive the right to sue us.  We wouldn't want to bite the hand that feeds us, right?"	
8605,"Hank, I would argue that Methylmercury is not _the_ most poisonous form of the metal, but the _second_ most poisonous form of the metal. Dimethylmercury seems a lot more poisonous altogether, especially considering its immense ability to penetrate materials, and the fact that the most prominent recorded death from it, that of highly-trained chemistry professor Karen Wetterhahn, resulted from a few accidental pipette drops onto a latex glove. Her entire story can be found here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn), but the sheer toxicity Dimethylmercury demonstrated in this case resulted in its complete abandonment in all but extremely limited research settings."

What took ten years was the discovery that the treatment process they used was not in fact catching all the mercury. Only then did they modify their processes to end the discharge of mercury."

8637,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Exaggerates his achievements? Not Rick. That motherfucker gets shit done!"	
8638,"My theory is that the Rick we see is from another universe that he came over to his first current one we see him in because that Rick died, which explains the 20 year gap, why he sees Morty as a kid etc. I however do not think that evil Morty is his original Morty, because if that was true Morty would have more evil characteristics as the standard. Since he is the Rickest Rick, I know this might be wrong, but I honestly feel that if evil Morty is his original, it would be to simple and not have the mind screw part that Rick&Morty is famous for."	
8639,"Damn the detail in this video..."

8667,"I think that he's more a sociopath than a narcissist. While he feels superior, he's aware of many of his shortcomings and mistakes and his depression implicates a low self esteem. I think he hates himself and has even less love for others making him both ruthless and reckless. He further believes in the strong eating the weak and he does not believe in moral values. Still, he's not a psychopath, since there are moments where he does care about things other than himself and psychopaths don't suffer depression or would ever breakdown like he did in Ricklaxation, nor would they ever love someone."

8680,"Hi guys, please subscribe to my channel, every day a new video :)"	
8681,"Thing about the memory of Rick holding Baby Morty is that the conclusions drawn from it in this video shouldn't be drawn quite so hard, as it is entirely possible that Rick snuck in to Beth & Jerry's life to check out his grandson unnoticed. Always irks me when people say so that couldn't have been current Morty.\n\nReally great video, otherwise. Utterly adore this channel."	
8682,"It's simple when you can change your reality at any point then nothing matters. It's the true postmodernist lifestyle nothing is in reality and due to that you become cynical and very nihilistic. And since you control the past present and future everything becomes about you. Which is why it would be point less to even be around someone like that, you'd say the sky is blue and he'd say red, go back in time make it red and then you're wrong. He'd get a rush by being always right and have to top himself constantly until he becomes so depressed he just ends all life to test himself to bring all life back."

8686,"Rick does NOT fit most of the requirements of being a narcissist.  Most of those requirements require Rick to be delusional in each respect.  Rick is NOT delusional.  What makes Rick so special is that he does rightfully deserve being able to act like a narcissist without BEING one."	
8687,"I had a whole comment written out explaining just how but it's not worth it  \n\nThis video is bad. \n\nIt's boring, contrived, and just fails to understand R&M at a fundamental level."

There is a finite curve that exists and shows how even in a sea of infinite universes there is a finite amount of inhabitable ones or ones that are similar enough to ours. There may be an infinite amount of universes, but the finite curve let's Rick know he can't do it at will. When they moved universes in season 1, Rick said himself that they only have a few universes left that fit Rick's criteria for a suitable home."

8698,"Rick isn't a narcisist, he is simply put just a nihilist. Let us look at the describtion:\n>>Nihilism (/ˈnaɪ.ɪlɪzəm/ or /ˈniː.ɪlɪzəm/	 from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\n\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age. Rick on the other hand, simply decided to not give a shit.\n\nI like one theory that states that RIck is simply a character - the only character- that knows that he is actually a cartoon character. Now if that would be true, it would be really a way of breaking the 4th wall."

8964,"Ingrid, what is the lipstick you're wearing in the video? I've been trying to find a shade like that for ages and it's been a trial and error kind of thing because, as you pointed out, you can't try drugstore makeup out before buying it so I've been getting these shades and have been really disappointed. Also, is that lipstick you have something you would recommend?"

8992,"Omg you finally look like your old self!!!"	
8993,"Ingrid, I really think you should read up on Zara and it's production chain. They're truly not a company worth buying and supporting. I hope you look it up! <3"

They have food, water , shelters, abilities to an extent  . But children in parts of Africa don't even have the necessity s such as water and food and are dying every minute , they are infected with diseases that are life threatening .  But celebrities fund foundations such as animal shelters or disability shelters , when we all know other children in other developing countries in Africa have it worst . Donate to the suffering children of Syria , Iraq , Palestine . All the war torn countries that are invisible to mainstream media . Why praise kylie for filming herself giving charity?  Why boast how good of a person you are ."	
9362,"1:07 - 1:21 wow but that was so stupid. Balance being a teenager and run a business. Ppl go to clg and work double shifts to support them and their family. Wow. Srsly  wow. I pity her.\nBut at least she's giving back something."

9387,"I have derealization and depersonalization and it's really hard but your videos help me."	
9388,"Really enjoyed watching this video. I don't have depersonalisation or anything but hearing kati talk about some of those things were so interesting and make me really want to study psychology. I went through and read to comments and so many people are saying they're struggling. I know this won't help or do anything but I'm so sorry you're having a hard time <3 I hope you get the help you need and I do believe that everything will turn out okay <3 xxx"

9393,"thank you. i really needed to hear this today, knowing that im not alone and that what i feel is valid <3"	
9394,"This video was VERY helpful for me to explain the differences between the 3 words. I have disassociation every single day, as other things happening in my body adds to this part of me going: ah, shit! Panic! Let's get out of this body quickly! It can show on me in many ways- feel like I'm floating being tied to a balloon so there's still this level of groundedness, or I have moments, especially when I'm not on my anxiety meds, where I just feel loony and I cannot connect what I am seeing to me, as if I am in a video game or I'm always strapped into a VR headset, it's terrifying and no one I've said about it so far really thinks this is real or it's not all in my head, so I just wanted to say thank you Dodie and her Therapist friend hehe ❤️❤️"	
9395,"When I get really depressed I don't recognise myself. Like I'll know I'm the one moving my body but it doesn't feel like me and when I look into a mirror I know it's my face because I know I'm looking into a mirror but I don't recognise it.\nThe longest that it has happened for one time was about a week\n\n*edit* When you were talking about small childhood issues that weren't that big but seemed worse at the time. At one stage the back of my hands were hit with a wooden spoon until my knuckels were bleeding, things like that still dont seem like a small issue"	
9396,"I finally know what to call this feeling	
9398,"I'm really reluctant to say that anything's wrong with me given that I'm so young, I've never had anything traumatic happen to me and I generally have a good memory, but I looked up a list of dissociation symptoms on a very reliable health website and I related to 8 out of 10 of them."	
9399,"Katiiii! I love this woman. Her videos saved my life, particularly her video on intrusive thoughts. I have severe OCD and I had a random spike in 2015 and I was very close to ending my life when I came across Kati's videos. If you're reading this Kati I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. 💕"	
9400,"i don't know why i'm crying halfway through but thank you for this. <3"	
9401,"So informative and helpful thanks lovely girls x"	
9402,"As someone who also suffers from derealisation and depersonalisation and is constantly told by therapists, I don't know what's wrong with you, or I don't know how to help you, this video was endlessly helpful for me. Thank you ❤️"	
9403,"When I got trama last year in my freshmen year and my way to cope was talking to myself which then turned into a imaginary friend. This friend then began becoming abusive (since they were my own thoughts) and kept me up at night. I haven't talked about it with anyone cause I'm 15 and I feel like they'll think I've gone mad..."	
9404,"I'm always so confused how you can like “test“ if you have depersonalisation or derealisation because how can I know that I feel spaced out? Like sometimes I feel like in a dream but then I'm like: “ah no it's real“ and that's it idk it's weird"	
9405,"This is super interesting and it actually helped me understand a few things about myself."	
9406,"I've had derealisation since I was really young but I never knew what was really happening. Lately I've just started to think it was something related to my anxiety. Thank you so much for making this video and explaining all of this it really helped."	
9407,"This was so interesting!"	
9408,"Even if I don't have derealisation or depersonalisation I have that kind of thoughts sometimes and I had anxiety and depression all this year and all your videos helped me so much. You talking about all this things makes me feel good because I found someone who knows what I went through all this months because even though there are a lot about mental illness in pages, there are not many people who actually suffers it and talks openly about it. Thank you so much Dodie. I know you're going to get out of this and that you're going to be able to feel yourself again."	
9409,"This comforted me I haven't recover since something that happened 2 years ago and to bring my brain back too! ❤️ \nI get headaches and anxiety too! And I fiddle so much and fidgeting since recovering from my trauma but I also might have ADHD too and still have derealisation too but I'm not diagonised but I know I have been going through depersonalisation for 2 years"	
9410,"Thank you so much for this video! It was really helpful to me and interesting to me, thank you thank you ❤❤"	
9411,"Great video, this is super interesting! I experience a few of these on and off occasionally and im ok with dealing with them a lot but when I'm worse especially when I'm panicked in a situation I can't get out of I get more physical things like painful pins and needles around my face and neck and the feeling like my skin crawling, what feels like really violent shivers down my spine,  is this a form of depersonalisation or just a physical manifestation of panic? I've always just called it depersonalisation because it seems like it would be but idk, I've always been curious.\n\nI'd like to try more types therapy though, I want to go back to talk therapy as it helped me a lot, especially with bigger things?  but I don't know if other things are worth trying more for the long term. Not excepting all the answers from youtube comments but still 😂❤"	
9412,"Hi\nI don't really know why I'm doing this but I guess it's a way to say something and not have anyone knows it's me.Im so sorry if your reading this,this is prosbly gonna suck.So,I'm relatively young(still in high school) and I think (I thiinnkkk) I may need help.Like I need to get medication or go to a therapist and I know I know something is wrong I can feel it in my brain but my mum hasn't noticed anything so I guess in my head it means it can't be that bad.This is getting ridiculously long and I'm sorry but I just wanna scream what's the point of being here any more god damn it"	
9413,"This helped a lot for me to understand what I'm told I have when ever a panic attack it's going to happen which I guess is a good thing in away because I know when I need to take myself out of something so yeah thanks 😊"	
9414,"every time you talk about this, i feel a little less crazy because no one in my personal life understands it at all. it makes me feel like it's more real and like i'm not making it up. thank you! x"	
9415,"im not sure what im going through. its not good to self diagnose but i feel like i may have dissociation or derealization. i feel very spaced out and hopeless in certain situations regarding relationships and being interested in getting closer to someone (or sometimes just in general). i become very tired and want to cry, and i have no clue whats going on around me. my hands begin to doodle random things on my classwork and i dont understand what ive just learned when my lesson is over. i hear everything and do my work but i also dont have any clue of what im working on. i feel like sometimes i will doodle on my paper while not even looking at it and but i can see what im drawing. i very often draw eyes when i feel this way. they are always crying or rolling into the back of the head. im not sure what im feeling but if you could help me find out i would greatly appreciate it. - x mirae"	
9416,"dodie, i'm not exactly sure what i hope to gain out of writing you this message, as i'm sure you get tons of messages like this daily. i suppose its more so for me than for you, but i really want you to know what an impact you have had on me. i have been struggling with depersonalization/derealization since i was little, but recently after a car accident was launched into it basically 24/7 for a couple of months now. its truly the scariest thing i've ever had to deal with, and there have been so many times when i have felt so completely alone and ready to give up. just seeing that you also struggle with this and that you still manage to do so much and reach so many people, honestly that keeps me going sometimes. this disorder is truly one of the most devastating things in my opinion, but you are such a bright light. so thank you, for this and for being you ❤️"	
9417,"When I have panic attacks I can't feel anything, last time my friend was hugging me and I didn't know until she told me. It also feels like you've lost your sight? Because you're so out of it it's almost like you can't see in away and you're memory goes away, I don't know but that's what I have"	
9418,"I don't know if this is exactly what I struggle with, but it seems to be a close match. I do often feel as if everything is a dream and I can't process what real life means, I also struggle with brain fog, which for me feels like pressing up against a window (seeing) and not being able to look behind you, so everything you need you have to put your arms behind you and feel for (thinking) and the bit where you remove yourself from the situation is the worst. it's somewhere between turning yourself into data and having a video game glitch and you're underneath the character and the graphics are wonky. this is such a weird description, but anyways, I'm going to look into it."	
9419,"I've been dealing with dissociation and depersonalisation disorder for over a year now. I was scared to watch this video, because Dodie has always been my escape from everything. The world is so unfair for making her feel the same things and struggling with this condition the same way I and many people do. This video was very informative and super accurate, good job girls 👏🏻💕 I still felt hopeless after watching this, like I always do when it comes to dissociation. I just feel like there is no cure for this. Nothing ever works. I feel like I will never feel alive again and I will never get back the contact to myself that I once lost. I don't know who I am, I only know who I once was. But that person in the past is not me anymore. I just wish everything would end and I found myself again. It will be over, but I'll always be asking when?"	
9420,"how i finally understand the line in the twenty one pilots song holding on to you. left side brain, the part of your brain that depression festers."	
9421,"this was so helpful, thank you so much <33"	
9422,"Idek what's wrong with me if can't even form the words to make out what was wrong with me. It could be depression but I know for a fact I have anxiety I just don't know how severe. I went to go talk to a psychologist, but I don't know how to be verbal about my issues bc idk what's wrong. I am soooo confused with how I feel and my parents won't take me to a psychiatrist bc they don't want me on meds. Bc they think that they won't help bc my mom said she took them when she was a child and they made her feel disconnected from the world. But it affects everyone differently. But they don't understand. My mom says it's part of being a teenager and it's all in my head. And idk what to do. Omg I didn't think it was normal to feel this way when you're a teenager but my mom seems to have all the answers. And it drive me fucking mad. Bc I can't talk to anyone bc I can't explain what I feel. And jeez. Does anyone have any advice. I'm probably just rambling. My mind feels like mush like its in a haze of some sort. Idk pls help me someone. 😩😳😢"	
9423,"Dodie, thank you so much for making this video!! I could relate to a few things and you really helped me out. I also had EMDR and it really helped me! :)"	
9424,"I don't have depersonalisation but every now and then I can have a Trippy/ strange situation where I look at my hands and they don't feel like me. I say my name over and over in my head and I think 'who is that ' like how is my identity a name ? Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this ?"	
9425,"I don't have derealisation but I have anxiety and I sometimes get spaced out randomly. For example, I will be sitting in class and I will zone out just randomly and the same question pops in my head, what if reality is a dream? I feel like I'm dreaming! \n\nIt's very odd. If you have this please could you give me some wise advice because I am very confused lol thanks! Also Dodie I hope you get better soon with your therapy help! I'm not going to give you my pity because I think that that's the worst thing someone can do when your going through something. You kind of just want them to go away😂 Thank you for sharing this video with us! It sure helped me and hopefully a lot of other people! I love you Dodie! x"	
9426,"Dodie!!! Thank you and Kati so so much for this!!! I have derealization mostly in chunks of time and usually it's when I'm stressed, and this explained so much :) Thanks so much for explaining about the trauma--I didn't know about that! I think too many things were happening so my brain just spaced out. For some reason, before this, I assumed it was brain chemistry but trauma makes sense! I really hope you get better soon :) and I hope I can work through this too <3"	
9427,"so should i fake feelings when im  disconnected?"	
9428,"I also have depersonalisation and derealisation, that's linked to my anxiety and things from my past. This was so helpful, especially to know that I'm not alone. My derealisation makes me panic so much and usually happens in social situations. It's so disorientating that I just have to leave the situation and go home a lot of the time."	
9429,"i was just wondering as somebody who doesnt have depersonalisation do you find that music or like playing ukulele helps to focus/ground you?"	
9430,"This is amazing. I truly understand and also deal with this. Dissociation is so hard and scary."	
9431,"Hi! I have a question/need advice:\nI took a math test yesterday and as I started getting more stressed because of time, I could feel myself getting more and more sucked away. After I came to terms with the fact that I wasn't gonna finish it, I decided to do the easy ones on the back, but I couldn't even remember how to do a simple factoring problem. My mind wasn't there at all. I was wondering how to fix this/bring my mind back when this happens? When it does come back after I get out of that situation, panic attacks come on because everything rushes at me at once. Any ways to bring my mind back to focus WHILE it happens, then not get flooded afterwards?"	
9432,"I experience derealization because of a major traumatic experience and sometimes it gets so bad where I become basically unresponsive because I'm just so spaced out and it leads to people getting angry at me because I don't respond to them and when I'm so spaced out it can be scary when someone is yelling at me while I feel like nothing is real."	
9433,"OHHH MY GOD I LOVE THISSO MUCH I LOVE KATY SO MUCH AND I LOVE DODIE SO EFFING MUCH ARGHA"	
9434,"Wow! I didn't know that was a thing! I don't deal with it anymore but for a while when I spoke I didn't recognize my own voice it was very alarming and very uncomfortable. Glad to know there is a term for that if it ever sparks up again"	
9435,"Ok idk if this is anything but whenever I'm in a happy experience I feel like I'm not taking it in idkis that normal"	
9436,"i'm soo happy you made this video because i could never properly explain what it was to my family and friends!! i've had it for over a year now, but overtime it's become less of a problem because i learned to cope with it although at times it does get bad.."	
9437,"guys if u ever need to talk my sc is: sunkophunkie. tell me if ur adding me. i have been through a lot and still am"	
9438,"Are there more people that tried emdr but couldnt think back to the memories, because they were to much or something like that?\nI had that and i feel like it wouldve helped so much if i just dared to think back"	
9439,"I have issues with derealisation and depersonalisation every single day and this video was so damn nice and well put together. I think I'm going to show it to my boyfriend so he can understand more about what I'm dealing with and how just telling me to stop isn't gonna make me feel okay and that I'm not just being sad or whatever and me acting like I don't care anymore isn't because of him, it's just because I feel like nothing is real and I feel disconnected from myself. Hopefully this will help him understand more, if any of you have any advice please let me know 👌💕"	
9440,"I love Kati so much! thank you for this video!"	
9441,"Look at me I have problems -this girl tries to hard to look like she has issues"	
9442,"Okay so this is no way me trying to get sympathy, because I am doing very well mentally. This is mainly out of curiosity. So, summer 2016 I was really really I'll, basically I was in and out of hospital for a month, I had three surgeries and basically lost a lot of weight. Anyway, I went back to school four days after getting out of hospital (only for like an hour a day) and it definitely tired me out a lot. Basically what I'm trying to say is that during my recovery time I'd feel a lot of things described in the video. It wasn't constant (like it is for Dodie) but a lot of the time I'd feel like I was almost in a dream, and nothing really felt real. I wasn't too worried as it didn't happen for long periods at a time and it didn't happen lots. Also my memory of when I was ill is quite foggy and I can't pinpoint specific moments. So, I was wondering if you can get derealisation that only lasts for a short time. Because once I got better it stopped happening. I'm fine now so don't worry, I'm just curious if that's what it was as I'm trying to learn more about mental health illnesses so I can be more helpful to friends who might go through these thing."	
9443,"i don't know what type of dissociation i suffer from but i believe it's some type of mix between derealisation and depersonalisation. when i experience it (which is quite often) it feels like a different world in my head. it's basically like i'm writing a book/a whole different universe every time i experience it. it is a continuous story but when i get tired of it or when somehow i start writing a new world the older one doesn't feel right anymore and it stresses me out to force myself to continue with the older one. everybody in my universe (i believe that they're called paracosmos in the literature world) has their own set story and life and thoughts and i can project myself onto any of them and live as them and that's how i deal with my real life issues - i make up some storyline that somehow makes my character feel in a similar way to the way i'm feeling irl and deal with it by not being myself per say. some characters are reoccurring since i was 14 (i have experienced this since i was 12 but i recall moments when i was 7/8 of very similar situations) and others die with the paracosmos i leave behind (i still remember them and their lives and all of that jazz, and sometimes i bring them back) (characters can stay alive but i change parts of their storyline and you know i make sure they fit into whatever world i picture). it is mostly triggered and stimulated by audio and visuals and when i watch a movie or a tv show and a character from those really speak to certain parts of me i almost always make sure to include parts of them in my paracosmos (i don't know if i'm expressing myself correctly). i also feel very attached and connected to them. i do lose keep track of time and sometimes space when i experience this and i do have gaps in memory because of this. i also have a really weird sense of time like it still feels like 2012 in my head (i was 12 at the time). i also experience this involuntarily when i'm in a not so positive mood and have lots of stress and anxiety or when i'm sad and all that jazz. when i'm happy it cools down a bit and i can sort of choose when to write it? like i know that if i listen to music when i'm happy i will dissociate and i know that if i'm walking by myself i will also do it etc. aside from this when i'm living in the real world i do experience feeling like i'm out of my body and i'm not inside of it (specially in social situations and when i have to interact with people) it feels like i'm in a movie you know? there's a lot more stuff that goes around this thing but i feel like i've written too much so i'm going to keep it to myself. also sorry if there are any mistakes i'm not a native english speaker x"	
9444,"Hey, I wanted to share my story if anyone is listening so uhm yeah if you want to read it you can, I just wanted to since I've never talked about it before\n\n\nSo since I was born my mother has had depression, anxiety and severe OCD. Not the clean kind of OCD, the hoarding. So for 12 years I live in copious amounts of trash and filth, and of course I was never allowed friends over. I was constantly verbally abused by her but I never really understood what that meant at the time. It got so bad I had to share a bedroom with my dad, brother and me. Thankfully my dad and brother moved out to a house next door that we previously rented. It's still too ugly and mouldy to ever invite friends (I've never had a birthday party) but I'm so so thankful that I actually get to move around my house and freely enter any room without being bombarded with trash... Sorry if this is tmi I've just never told this to anyone, not even my counsellor. I'm 13 years old now and it still really affects my day to day life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I have self harmed and had one suicide attempt. I constantly feel pessimistic about my future. I get good grades, but I'm extremely anti social. I'm scared I'm going to develop Asperges, a genetic mental disorder my mum carries. My uncle has it and because of it I've never met him, same with my grandma. Sorry if this is a little weird, but it feels good to let it out."	
9445,"It's strange because I've just had a day of feeling spaced out but I feel so much more connected to myself now I'm watching this video, maybe because I relate? Or because it's helping me feel less alone x"	
9446,"I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING"	
9447,"I love this. I love Kati, she was so understanding i loved everything about this. so calming. thank you"	
9448,"I'm not gonna say I have this stuff, but I tend to have episodes where everything feels like a dream and very distant. For a while I would have small moments of depersonalization, and during school years, I would have up to almost a month at a time or at least most of a week I will/would just have empty busy times. In those times I just go through life without thinking and barely remember what happens when I come out of it. I get really touchy a lot and I have a friend who used to physically latch onto people and when she did that to me, I got stressed and had that distant feeling and that feeling usually meant in a few days I would have those empty periods of time.\nI don't know, though. Just don't attack me, because I'm only saying I have similar experiences and am very paranoid and idk why, but I'm not going to diagnose myself."	
9449,"Can you have the text stay up for a bit longer on your videos please? I've noticed a few youtubers recently started making text come and go quite quickly and it's not always possible to pause the video fast enough to read the text . Especially important for something that is giving context and Wil make it more accessible to people. Thanks!"	
9450,"Okay this really helped me sort of understand why I feel detached from the world at times. I've been in a car crash and ever since it's scarred me & stuck with me for the past 8 years. My friends think I'm being dramatic but even I know I'm not being dramatic because I know it was sourced from somewhere. Thank you, Dodie ❤️"	
9451,"When I watched your last video I didn't really see myself with the things you were talking about, but this one where she was talking about the many little T's adding up it really hit me. also how you were talking about how touch can ground you, I've never really thought that was at all related to me not feeling alive or awake or real, but i guess it is now. I'm defiantly not self diagnosing but I think I relate with a lot of this.   \nI was wondering if it's possible to have more of a less severe case of derealization"	
9452,"omg doddie trendin"	
9453,":')"	
9454,"yeahhh sertraline sucked for me too rip"	
9455,"Shiny!"	
9456,"Thanks for this fantastic video! During my worst stages of anxiety I experienced depersonalisation and derealisation for 3 months straight. Luckily through coping techniques and talking through my trauma I overcame it and haven't felt this way in years. You got this Dodie! ❤"	
9457,"Hi Dodie! \n\nLet me first say that I love your music and your videos! They make my day better :)\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that I'm a 20 year old Music Education student and I was wondering if music therapy could be an option that you've considered for derealization/depersonalization. I'm not a doctor, but I do strongly believe in the results that music therapy can bring. I'd like to maybe know your thoughts about it too :) Does Britain have any programs like this (I'm from Canada and I do know it's becoming more popular here)? Could this be another helpful thing for people with this disorder?\n\nI don't want to seem bossy or anything	 I'm just curious about what you think and I'd like to help in any way that I can haha. \n\nKeep making videos Dodie and keep being an inspiration because you are doing amazing things :) Thanks :)"
9458,"thank you dodie for uploading this video. I understand more about derealisation and know there are other mental diseases out in the world noticed. Maybe I do have something or maybe I don't. Overall, you made my eyes open and make me feel real for just at least some minutes."	
9459,"I feel like I have dissociation, but it's not during moments of stress or trauma. It's mainly brought on by being awake in the middle of the night. Could being awake really late cause a trigger in my brain?"	
9460,"Thank god ive found the name for this. I'm already feeling a lot better."	
9461,"I posted a comment on here before, but the question just occurred to me. Has anyone down here in the comments gone through dp/dr and came out of it?  Best of luck to you Dodie. I'm actually in the UK now and it'd be amazing to meet someone else that's experiencing the same thing. Best of luck to you<33"	
9462,"I usually don't comment on this type of stuff, I doubt anyone will even read this but I don't know what's wrong with me. Everything feels like a dream. It doesnt feel real. I don't really have past traumatic events. I don't know why nothing feels real or why I get sad and tired all the time. I make myself busy doing stuff to try to distract myself and it doesn't work a whole lot. For some reason I feel not as sad currently and it changes from extremely sad to almost okay. When I'm upset I can't imagine what it was like to be happy. I write stuff when I'm sad and when I'm happy I'll read it and be like how did I ever feel this the main thing that messes me up is time. Stuff is over too fast and time just feels very weird"	
9463,"wow I've had derealization and depersonalization and I didn't know what was wrong but this helped me out so so much. I just didn't feel like I was there and I didn't feel like I was my self. I have more memories with my derealization because it used to happen A LOT. I never knew what was wrong. During those episodes I don't like talking to anyone because it makes me feel more out of myself. Thank you soooo much"	
9464,"This video made me realize that I have had moments of derealization and depersonalization in the past. Last year, when I was at school, I just felt like I was floating through a dream that never ended. Youtube has helped me feel those emotions again and all of the sudden the feelings would go away! Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel! Thank you so much for making this video, it helped me a lot! \nLots of love!"	
9465,"my? two? favorite? people? in? one? video???? I'm shook , I lo ve y a l l 💕"	
9466,"i'm not sure i have dissociation/depersonalization/derealisation? idk, i have long periods where my brain feels disconnected from my body... kinda like,, floating in the space above my head? weird concept i know,, and i don't feel like i have any emotion and every feeling- physical or emotion- is like dulled at the edges and sometimes lights can seem too bright and everything i hear seems like white noise. i don't really have trauma tho so idkkkk i feel like i'm being dramatic and unnecessary"	
9467,"The bit about the marbles was SO INTERESTING AND EYE-OPENING I never thought of trauma that way. I treated it as a single marble I wouldn't stop picking up instead of something that's been shattered/dispersed through everything."	
9468,"tbh the inside out analogy made a lot of sense"	
9469,"okay i need help. sometimes i get a feeling that sort of sounds like this but i dont know if it is or not. for example the other night i was in the backseat of my friends' car on the way home from a movie and idk why but she started tickling me as a joke and we were laughing and i was squirming and as i bent over to hide my face from her, i just felt this really weird wave of disconnection. like i was floating outside of my body, and i couldnt feel myself smiling or smell anything and all the sounds around me went hazy, like i was under water. it happened again twice that night when i was just sitting there in the car, not even laughing and moving around anymore. its happened more times for sure but that was the most recent. is this something to look into?"	
9470,"I zone out when I'm stressed and start to be quiet and sometimes I do it in class and it scares my teacher 😂 	-
9471,"that was so educating and well illustrated, i love it!!"	
9472,"I think I might have derealization, but like you when it's at its worst depersonalization. Honestly to me it's really terrifying. I don't fell like I'm here and that I'm in a dream. I really wish I could talk to a parent but they'd think I'm just going through a phase or being over dramatic. I really wish I could figure out what's wrong with me... \nBut I just wanted to say thank you so much dodie. Thanks to you, I figured some things out and why I'm feeling like this. Not everything of course, there's still a lot I don't know. But videos like these really help ♡♡ ilysm"	
9473,"Schema therapy is amazing! I have tried a bunch of meds, general talk therapy, CBT, TMS, a bunch of things in an intensive outpatient program, and they helped but none as much as schema therapy."	
9474,"I have no memory of my childhood, my brain repressed every memory because of a really big trauma that happened to me when I was 5"	
9475,"This was wonderful 'cause I learned so much! Thank you Dodie and Kati!"	
9476,"To me, looking in a mirror is a scarrest part of depersonalisation because you start to realize so well that something is wrong. Luckily I haven't experienced this for a long time like now it happens only when I'm extra tired and sad, it feels like your body tries to protect you"	
9477,"I cannot tell you enough how much this type of videos helped me! Really, really from the bottom of my heart thank you."	
9478,"when i was younger i used to feel like i was trapped in my body and that my hands weren't my part of my body and now i'm just realizing i am mentally ill"	
9479,"iz mah burthdae todaeee yaeeeeeeeeeee"	
9480,"OMG... I think I may have this... I go into this state of mind where it's feels like I'm dreaming and it's hard to control my body and what's going on... and I start to panic before and after it happenes... I have never heard of this and I thought it was just me... but like everyone thinks I'm crazy when I tell them"	
9481,"Can someone help me figure out whats wrong with me?? I have a constant state of feeling like I'm forgetting to do something (when I'm not), or that I should be doing something else.

The foundation is great but it not only matches skin tone but the undertone as well and the one you picked up is a bit warm and you might be on the cooler/pink side.

U put so much foundation on....of course the other stuff isn't gonna blend correctly. I kinda feel like u are being bIas cuz u seemed a lol shooketh that u weren't invited to the event. But other than that...u talk quite fast"	
9617,"I'm getting annoyed that people think just because Fenty foundation is water base and also per Riri doesn't oxidized	 assume it's not going to oxidized . Foundation does get darker. Doesn't matter what situation .  What plays in is the person's skin type, how their bodies natural PH levels on the skin reacts to the formula , how much humidity is in the air, what products they put on before hand can cause a small chemical reaction to the foundation. Just because one is selling out doesn't mean it will work for you and your body chemistry.  There's a basic science to it . I hate how almost everyone in the makeup community thinks they are gurus

I'm all for guys doing makeup but I just think it's creepy when I see dudes that have a dick and two balls wearing acrylic nails. Oh and stay off the Adderall pills please!"

9627,"I'm confused why you purchased the shades that don't match just to show your viewers. couldn't you have just taken a photo of it on the back of your hand in store?..."	
9628,"Charles you teach me one thing: be careful what comes out my mouth because your one wrongful act on this social media platform will haunt you to your grave. Everyone even your own will look at you side way. To be honest, I think he was giving a honest review. Just slow down abit when speaking... it takes practice but slower enough to capture the audience when doing product reviews."

9641,"your eyes are closed more often than they're open."

I don't want to see your video because it is a bunch of lies if you claim that 1,000's of people died in Florida - THAT IS A LIE - TOTAL LIE - 1000's are not dead!"

10353,"Well then"	
10354,"How is Key West?"	
10355,"some did want to evacuate"	
10356,"Miami better get used to water in the streets--more storms and rising sea levels in coming years.  Or if you're not a big fan of reason or science, just listen to Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones, do nothing, and drown.  But the rest of us don't want to pay any more federal subsidies for your reality denying arses to rebuild in areas that get flooded every two years."	
10357,"I live in Florida my intenet is shit im in my house but its baricated with iron stuff idl what its called...i am terrified well idk if i will die or no #PrayForFlorida"	
10358,"What the hell do you mean punch in the face?"	
10359,"Lookie, lookie!  New blue embroidered jackets, I'm impressed! Maybe their news isn't fake after all?"	
10360,"Pray for these people They appreciate it"	
10361,"That news anchor has the most ripped neck I've ever seen."	
10362,"When you kill millions of people in Iraq, the mother of nature is angry."	
10363,"Boring hurricane"	
10364,"AND time to turn the channel, UNfamily-friendly Family Feud is on, ughh."	
10365,"Fake news \n\nNo such thing as hurricanes"	
10366,"Die Motherfuckers Die, you got what you deserve assholes..this is how God punishes evil motherfuckers......greetings from Mexico...."	
10367,"Can't believe libtards think the gubment has a hurricane machine that can just randomly be switched on to: A-wipe out brown and black ppl from certain places but not killing or displacing any whites, and B-using the machine to distract from any narratives like Charlottesville.  You're fucking retards!!!!!!"	
10368,"ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!\nHello guys, checkout some very very interesting information about Florida that everybody MUST know here http://bit.ly/2eQvIgZ"	
10369,"But... what if you needed to open it on while stuck on an incline?"	
10370,"and thats my boring video of the day\n\n#42 on trending, grats"	
10371,"it's for when you accelerate....so shit doesn't shoot out the door. all that fwd Honda civic G force you get on the launch"	
10372,"Thats actually a really cool little feature. If you had something with some weight in there, like a phone, a sock full of coins, or a lead pig. They'd probably overcome the spring-loaded door and slide out under heavy acceleration (especially up a hill).\nCheers for sharing your find, man."	
10373,"This is for when the car accelerates.  Have you ever had something on your dash and started out real fast, everything gets dumped on the floor.  This weight when the car accelerates quickly will cause the door to be held shut preventing everything inside from coming out."	
10374,"What an utterly pointless video. This deserved some recognition?"	
10375,"It's for when you have something with a bit of weight to it stored in there (mobile phone, etc), so it wont come flying out on steep hills, accelerating, etc."	
10376,"Then you park on a hill and realise you cant get your smokes out..."	
10377,"Jesus H. Christ in heaven above fuck me in the ass. Why are there so many negative comments about shaking and dropping? I didn't have a single problem with the video and thought it was very interesting. Shut the fuck up!"	
10378,"LMFAO... and when you stick your cigarettes and wallet in that box then park on a hill...LOL  yes this did happen. 1995 Rodeo.  I removed the door FOREVER..."	
10379,"K WE GOT IT IN 20 SC. NO NEED TO GO ON."	
10380,"That was actually brilliant."	
10381,"Hey genius, it's to prevent stuff from flying out when you ACCELERATE.\n\nYou really think they would put a locking mechanism for when the car is tilted backwards??"	
10382,"700 people cannot hide their drugs in there anymore."	
10383,"Can't fit your hand in there because it is made to hold CD cases, not 'stuff'.  Don't you hate when the quarter you just really need is sitting back there and you can't get it out? [Insert dropping and smashing sounds here...]"	
10384,"i wish they would have done somthing like this mirrior under the sun visor. the dam lid would fall down. eventually got pissed amd ripped it off ass a cop was parked next to me."	
10385,"Just think of the engineer, or team there of, that is soaking up a free paycheck to overthink simple problems. Why simply use a stronger spring that holds the door closed when you can spend hours making a stupid fail safe for a junk compartment!"	
10386,"There's a similar feature on tripods that will hook your camera from falling off... It also prevents shakes and rattling."	
10387,"and if you park uphill you can't  access whats inside?!"	
10388,"I Jared,\nMy name is Johanna and I work for a video production company called StoYo Media. We would like to publish video in a story. Of course we would mention you as owner of the content and make your name visible in the video. \nMany thanks\nJohanna"	
10389,"this would have been a good video except your camera work. Please put your phone on a tripod next time you want to make a boring video of the day. \nShaky video is worse than Portrait video"	
10390,"Here's to engineers"	
10391,"You're a nerd."	
10392,"the guy holding a camera acts like retard, so annoying"	
10393,"So if the cars upside down....it shuts the box?"	
10394,"I'll bet it's super annoying to have it lock up in San Francisco."	
10395,"When going up a hill, that locks the door and stops anything that may slide inside from sliding out and flying across the car. So in essence, that is a time saver, because it saves you the time you'd have taken to clean that mess up."	
10396,"If you are getting towed the guy can't steal your spare credit cards and cash etc...."	
10397,"People in San Fran be like duh."	
10398,"Could you stop hitting the thing on the table. I don't know if it's on purpose but man is it annoying."	
10399,"Ok this is cool but what's the code for my fuckin radio?  It just decided I need a code so now no music."	
10400,"STOP moving the camera around so much, you idiot fuckstick."	
10401,"Are you really this stupid?"	
10402,"552k views. Not even 200 subscribers. What"	
10403,"It's on the Suburu Baja as well....actually, it's probably on all Suburus"	
10404,"For when dat vtech kick in yo \n\nDon't want homie dawgs weed flyin bout da car when u takes off real fast out da KFC drive tru in the civic u n yo boys just stolt from da white mans down da street."	
10405,"One of the many tiny things the engineers came up with that was kept in the design!"	
10406,"Shit, now I gotta go to my car."	
10407,"How many times can he drop it shake and drop it again, I thought he was showing a video on how durable it was."	
10408,"It's the little things in life 🤣"	
10409,"OMG stop slamming SH!T on the table!"	
10410,"You should notice a small, useful device called a tripod."	
10411,"It's probably a part of the safety features for accidents. Whatever is in the compartment during a crash would overcome the spring loaded door and become a lethal projectile. The weight would lock the door during an impact. Just a guess"	
10412,"When your laptop is worth more than your car"	
10413,"It so when you have heavy stuff in it and you floor it, the thing doesn't dump all your crap out. Not for hills. It's a honda, not a Jeep genius."	
10414,"When your boring video of the get becomes trending"	
10415,"Wow, worst camera work ever. I've know squirrels with near fatal meth addictions that had a steadier hand with the camera. This was impossible to watch after about 7 seconds in."	
10416,"That's so rice"	
10417,"That must be a feature to stop a-holes from fumbling through all their crap while driving. It probably locks when the car hits a certain speed too not just uphill."	
10418,"It doesn't keep the door from opening on its own. It keeps YOU from opening the door. Certainly not a feature I'd like to discover when I really need to get into the cubby."	
10419,"Japanese engineering. The best in the world"	
10420,"Alternate title is ape manhandles car part."	
10421,"Jared, Roger here saying hello! Aka Klasse Act aka The Striped SVT. John S sent me your vid here, hope all is going well with you....subscribed!"	
10422,"Wow genius, how about we take a look at the rest of the car where there's 100 things that are much more impressive."	
10423,"Its to keep it from flying open in a rearend collision. Good try though."	
10424,"This guy hit the jackpot. Only had 120 subs, is on trending and gets 466k views"	
10425,"Maybe has something to do with the door opening slowly and smoothly? :/"	
10426,"So fucking what? If it was constantly flying open everytime you drove uphill, it would be a major design flaw. Is this a video to amaze retards or something?"	
10427,"Lmao he's not a professional YouTuber!  Y'all watching Casey neistat and expecting everyone to give a shit about video quality! He's just a nice man who was trying to share something cool! Keep bein groovy Jared!"	
10428,"be me, own POS 2003 CIVIC hand-me-down. Always have to park on uphill slope when I get home from minimum wage job....can't open goddamn storage unit if I'm not level, so needless to say I often have to leave valuables behind until the next day to retrieve.   One day I leave my prized anime cards behind after forgetting to open latch during a level straight away.  Park near studio apartment.  Storage unit is rendered useless.   Cards are in the car overnight.   That night there is a BLM protest on my block.  Car gets set ablaze.  Cards are gone forever.   \nGet on youtubes to find solace, comfort and maybe some seductively soothing ASMR.....instead find a fidgety dork honoring the Honda engineers for this this blatant quality control oversight.   \nDecide to take pills and wait for the sweet release of death.  This will be my final post.   RIP in peace, me."	
10429,"Everyone in the comment section needs to chill. He's holding a large, clunky object with his non dominant hand so he can hold the camera. So what if he's a little clumsy."	
10430,"I'd find that really frustrating if I lived on a hill and that damn lock kept making getting my stuff out after I parked difficult to get out."	
10431,"Who else is watching this after reading the Mashable tweet ?"	
10432,"pick it up and throw it around five hhundred more times"	
10433,"but what if you park on a hill and need to get something out of there?"	
10434,"Check put my channel for some cool car videos :)"	
10435,"Wow mind blown wow I'm going to put one on my dick now so it always hangs straight"	
10436,"another neat feature of Hondas is garbage airbags they subcontracted - they replaced my airbags three times TWICE FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE. i drove a car with a faulty safety system for a freaking decade. done w Honda"	
10437,"What if you park up hill and you want to get your shit out of there but you cant cuz it locked it self? Does now seem very ingenious now lol"	
10438,"Some engineer at Honda must be really happy rn"	
10439,"It's there to lock the door in case of a rear end collision."	
10440,"cool..ya coulda made this video about a minute and a half shorter tho just sayin"	
10441,"I am not sure I understand correctly:\nIt sounds like you cannot open it when you are parked at a hill?"	
10442,"my honda crv has this as well. couldnt really figure a use for it when i had my dash apart a saw it so i just taped it so it wouldnt lock. never thought of hills though!"	
10443,"A man is washing his car with his son. The son asks...\n\nDad, can't you just use a sponge?"	
10444,"mmm, neat."

10457,"Mine got stuck yesterday morning and I can't get my fucking keys out !!! Without pulling out the dash!!!! WTF!!! Had to Uber to school!!!!"	
10458,"One hand recording makes me rage....uggghhh"	
10459,"If it deserved noticing you'd find the person who designed it, but you didn't. You just want people to see how smart you are, like a typical redditor."	
10460,"So for everyone who had one of these and could never figure out why they wouldn't open up while accelerating or driving uphill. Let's all do a 1 minute silence in their memories."	
10461,"You are shit at filming man."	
10462,"Its not for hills,but  mostly parkings i think."	
10463,"you should click clack drop and bang that thing around a few more times in your next video"

What made him think he could possibly wing It? Shame on everyone involved who allowed  this to happen, this is people's lives we are talking about. I can't imagine what it would be like to be a deaf person who needed to hear this information sitting at home with your children trying to understand what this moron is saying, I would have been so furious. I hope there are consequences for this moron. Unbelievable!!!!"

10584,"No. Just no. How? Who? Where did the find this interpreter? Tell me this is a joke made in really really poor taste. 😠"	
10585,"Dude!!! I've been studying ASL on and off since I was 7...that being said I KNOW I can't do more than vocab words! (English grammar I got, ASL grammar is tricky to put into practice for me) Have some respect, if you know you can't keep up with the person speaking, one of his many problems, don't do it!! If you find fingerspelling tricky, another of his issues, don't do it! Finally, if you are not an actual interpreter or in any way fluent in ASK, his biggest issue...DONT DO IT!! Lives hang in the balance for something like this."	
10586,"He is not an interpreter.... he is a lifeguard who brother is deaf. Poor guy....caught up in the wrong situation"	
10587,"This is so sad."	
10588,"'ay, umm. anyone know asl?'\n'kinda'\n'YOU'RE HIRED!'\n\njust dont say you know it\ni know more than him and im 13, not deaf and dont know anybody deaf.\n god"	
10589,"What I read in a news story (accuracy is unknown to me) is that he was pushed into doing this and never claimed to be a translator for the deaf, just has a deaf brother. \nThis has happened in the past and it was stated gov. translators would be screened and certified (or whatever) in the future. \nIf they were in a bind, they should have written up cards with the info on it for the deaf to read. Misinformation is usually worse than no information."	
10590,"He should be a congressman, they fake it everyday!"	
10591,"lucky penny and stress pig?\n\nfuck my state"	
10592,"My first job in high school was interpreting ASL with no certification for minor things in my neighborhood - also not paid at a real interpreters level, of course. Coming from Saint Augustine with FSDB, it's a more deaf-friendly city. I would imagine it's rarer to find signing hearing people in other areas. \n\nIt should be obvious that he was uncomfortable, so I instantly felt he must have been asked to interpret because of a lack of a certified interpreter under the circumstances. I have found myself in non-televised interpreting situations before that were too big for my britches. I would have been mortified if they were recorded. Please give him a break - he did his best, & it's a tough, high pressure situation to be in, especially on the spot. Let's not overlook the fact that he's serving in other ways, too, which is more than most can say at the moment. Give people a break - we all could use them sometimes.\n\n It may not have been ideal, but really people, a hurricane just went through our state. We've got bigger problems at the moment, & fortunately closed captions. Fortunately this was not a true *emergency* message (as far as I could tell), even though I know it must be isolating to the hard of hearing to be excluded from any message/update. So instead of spending our time pointing fingers, why don't we all just learn some sign language instead?"	
10593,"Oh my goodness ... this is horrible ."	
10594,"First off, it is unfortunate that the local FEMA representatives responsible for emergency operations AND the local municipal government failed to have a qualified resource available to interpret, it seems to me that the problem is more of educating THEM on the importance of having qualified interpreting resources.  People sometimes think that when someone says:  Oh, I know sign language they are qualified to interpret (maybe all they know is finger spelling!  I give them credit for at least attempting to have someone there versus not having anyone at all.  This is of NO FAULT of Marshall's and he clearly did not state he was an interpreter in the first place.  Too many things happening in too short of a time for a critical natural disaster such as hurricane Harvey and hurricane Irma do not always allow organizations sufficient time to plan these things at the last minute -- that's why they should have agreements in place and interpreters included in ALL Emergency Management plans.  Don't trash the person who at least attempted to help, trash the people who don't understand they could have caused more damage than good by not having a qualified interpreter available."	
10595,"Hi Jane! I am a reporter for ABC News and would like to speak with you about this video. Can you please message me when you have a chance?\nThank you."	
10596,"J.   i liked that."	
10597,"People getting offended but maybe they just did not have someone like they should have so they had John who did sign language in high school 2 decades ago to do it."

10603,"they should've gotten Lydia Callis fro NYS who did all of the Hurricane Sandy briefings."	
10604,"I shared this with my little circle....sorry to rant, excuse me, people fluent in sign language are better at spelling than a non ASL....am i correct??? i am just stunned!!!"	
10605,"How does something like this even HAPPEN?"	
10606,"I assume this unqualified interpreter knows we can all see his unqualified know-nothing ass."

10621,"OMG!! i can't get over it!!! I suspected thank you for confirming!!! OUCH! my heads gonna explode!!!! UGH!!! THIS IS EVIL!"	
10622,"Thank you for captioning what the interpreter is signing to raise awareness of what was really interpreted for those unfamiliar with ASL. Devastating mistake to not have a certified interpreter at such a crucial time. Generates more problems/panic than simply relying on CC."	
10623,"Anyone know jive?"	
10624,"No, he wasn't trying. You can tell he wasn't trying. Stop making excuses for someone who just couldn't do the job. No one could make him do anything. This is just awful."	
10625,"It's likely all the actual interpreters already evacuated and this guy along with other officials and rescuers were the only ones left. It's a shame he was thrown under the bus like this because he probably isn't trained as an interpreter and forced to do this."	
10626,"Make sure you take your Pets with you first and don't forget your kids.\n\nF*ck you Yanks are dumb, how many Muffin heads does it take to report on a Hurricane?!?"	
10627,"To all the people trying to defend this man by saying it is not his fault that he's completely butchered ASL during this crucial time, OF COURSE IT IS. In no way should this guy have raised his hand if the county asked hey does anyone know sign language?. And if they were still pressuring him to partake, then fucking run away! This is so horrible. Very disappointing and shameful for all those involved."	
10628,"2:23 Who Mexican"	
10629,"Well she talked at the speed of light, give the guy a break."	
10630,"Please stop the hate speech.  You are all seeing a Lifeguard with a Deaf brother attempting to interpet.  This is an example of why interpeter training is required."	
10631,"if your deaf, and you rely on a random tv dude to inform you that a hurricane is\ncoming, then you've got bigger issues. this guy was not qualified for the task. obviously. but he volunteered to do it so as to not go totally without. so relax and stop taking about jail time."	
10632,"remember when that guy faked it during Obama's speech? he was an interpreter for like 20 years. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn81s7BhunM"	
10633,"It was him or nothing. He was roped into it because he knows a tiny bit of ASL. Give him a break."	
10634,"Is anyone else tired of these nanny state pressers. And how incompetent do you have to be to have to grab a faux deaf interpreter that knows very little sign language. Unfortunately this has been happening a lot lately. These are govt officials? This would rarely ever happen in the private sector. Someone should be fired over this."	
10635,"I am hard hearing and deaf too that I can't believe it this interpreter is suck! He not really ASL and why someone want him interpreter for on news? to tell people warning not clear. His signing is AWFUL. I am shock."	
10636,"You can tell by the way he was dressed, etc, he was probably pulled from the crowd. Goes to show the ignorance of many local agencies and untrained masses. Unacceptable!!! 😡"	
10637,"ITS ALL FAKE PEOPLE, FALSE FLAG ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS AS HELL"	
10638,"2:15 she has her lucky stress piggy and found a penny heads up, so all will be ok.  < \nlady not the interpreter.  The interpreter actually made more sense."

10640,"i could have done a better job and i'm ASL illiterate!!!! SORRY FOR SO MANY COMMENTS BUT I'M OFFENDED!!!! my heart drops into my stomach :-("	
10641,"Hi Jane, I'm a British journalist and think this is a great story that highlights a problem many people don't know exists -- would you mind my making a copy of the video / captions to share ? Could you send me a message at ericmunn01@gmail.com? Thanks in advance!"	
10642,"If I was standing by where he stands, I would beat the shit out of him. This is unacceptable for fake interpreter."	
10643,"I Know that it's appalling if this is his best attempt at interpreting, but we need to also think that this might not be ASL, it could be international sign language, Spanish sign language, french, etc. I'm not saying that it is, but just think about the fact that it could be something different than ASL before we start condemning him."	
10644,"my dad is deaf glad he isn't in Florida"	
10645,"Gee, at least he can get SOME of the actual words right. I always wondered how accurate sign language was.  Spoken language is difficult enough for the human mind to grasp	 how meaning can be conveyed with these crude signals as rapidly as speech is tough to believe. BTW, in Japanese signing, WHITE people were referred to by using an open OK type gesture around the eye, signifying round eyes.  It conveyed the intended meaning BUT it was later judged 'racist' and it was changed.  My Gawd."

You get it! You most definitely get it! I mean... I've seen videos from big names come down here to taste our food, like Anthony Bourdain and Gordan Ramsay. They showcased our food and sang them praises, but you... you just GET IT!\n\nI only wish I had followed you on your other social media, I didn't realise you came down here!

10864,"For a group of people who are inspired by Jeff Buckley there seems to be a valley between the music quality.\n\nThe guitar is pretty flat and fights with the vocals quite often and more importantly the vocalist doesn't know when to shut up and the guitarist doesn't know when to shine."

10991,"Cool"	
10992,"I heard the iphone 8 and iOS 11 is awesome, oh, finally, it's catching up to S6..."	
10993,"IPhone are behind on releasing tech and features but for some reason everyone thinks it's the greatest stuff.     They are about to release the iPhone x with wireless charging and it's in the news papers like it's an original thing.  Samsung have been doing wireless charging since the s6.   Wtf...."	
10994,"I wish iPhone 8 would make a bundle for those deaf people with a Cochlear Implant with a Nucleus 6 or lower. That would be a badass upgrade."	
10995,"are all those features coming to iphone 6 plus as well?,i know the update is compatible with iphone 6 plus but i don't if it may be limited by hardware on some features."	
10996,"LOL FINALLY GET A FILE EXPLORER BUT A SHIT ONE"

10998,"hey where do you get your iPhone wallpapers from?"	
10999,"Dude iPhone is so late on this features android been doing for years"	
11000,"Android has done it before ..."	
11001,"Anyone know where the posters in the background are from?"	
11002,"Did you switch back from the Galaxy s8?"	
11003,"I really want there to be a feature where you can download apps to record things your doing on your phone. They only have them on other types of phones but not for iOS devices. You can use hacks to download the apps but it will only let you for one minute. They should make it so it Doesn't show your battery percentage or time for privacy purposes. And so it is long than one minute."	
11004,"Can people just get android already? Lol we've been waiting for customisability... I sure haven't ..."	
11005,"The document scanning (if it works correctly) will be great. Big day tomorrow for Apple!! btw 5203 notifications??? I'd pass-out with that many notifications pending. LOL. Great Video. :-)"

11011,"IOS 11 is ugly ! I'm staying at 10.3.3"	
11012,"I think it's great that IOS & Android are pushing new features to better our phone/tablet experiences."	
11013,"In other words make it more like android which is better"	
11014,"Now, with new features, you too can support modern-day slavery!\nThink Different\nTell me what your justification is in the comments below!"	
11015,"I think the iPad is slowly turning into a computer"	
11016,"CooooooooooL . Can we drag and drop in iphone 7+ ?"	
11017,"you GOTTA make the replace a laptop video - thats my no. 1 question!!"	
11018,"Cool, but my android can do 80% of this already."	
11019,"people dont realize that its the little things that count"	
11020,"Anything that allows us to customize and give a little bit more freedom, I'm up for it.\n\n\nTHEN SWITCH TO ANDROID.........."	
11021,"I'd love to see an iPad pro vs laptop video"	
11022,"I thought there was gonna be new features and these features are taken from android smh"	
11023,"Stuff that iPhone are coming out with andriod had that ages ago. And iphones are rip of just paying more for a bigger screen. I use to be a apple fan but when Steve jobs passed away they just went shit and ran out of ideas"	
11024,"Tbh apple is better because it's more simple. I recently got an android and it took me forever to get cellar data on"

11029,"Wow, apple devices getting features android has had for years... I can't wait to see the excitement on my apple friends faces..."	
11030,"Oh NO WAY! So the new features are just simple things samsung have been using since 2010. That is great	)"
11031,"Been on Android for a while. Might give Apple 1 more chance."

11042,"My friend had the beta of this. The next day his phone broke. We told him he should've waited"	
11043,"I definitely think a video on whether or not the iPad Pro can replace your laptop would be a great idea. The current generation was fairly close to replacing my laptop for classroom purposes, but I still needed my laptop most of the time. Maybe the new variation will be closer to replacing a laptop completely!"	
11044,"Feature 1 after buying your wallet is empty like the clean water in africa"	
11045,"I actually have the beta and it freezes so much"	
11046,"I want that video"

11049,"Why does the s pen sound silly? It's a gotdam note...the whole point of the phone!"	
11050,"Nice tips but imho the new Samsung UI has outdone Nova launcher. With the theme store, as you said you can have whatever look you want including icons which really is far better than what's on Nova, which really is just an additional skin on an already better skin and a waste of resources."

11075,"No no no, Amy Adams better not be in the sequel. She ruined Louis Lane but she better not ruin Beverley."	
11076,"Nothing, I don't get that scared."	
11077,"I enjoyed this take on the movie but it was a Comedy.\nI didn't find this penny wise as terrifying as Tim Currys.\nAnd I didn't understand why his head kept getting bigger I some scenes.\nThe George scenes was good and I didn't think they would go there.\nAnd l believe the George and bill truly loved each other the as for the friends.\nIt was bull, no friend that are bought together by bullies would act like that towards each other.\nAlso spinning the camera or shaking the camera doesn't make this the most terrifying movie you will see this year.\nWell I hope not or the horror genre is done.\nI rate this comedy 7/10."	
11078,"Mike was supposed to be the historian but they gave his important role to the fat kid. I preferred the book because he was one of the few black characters in fiction given development, racism in the 80s was addressed, and he wasn't stereotypical, but in this movie they tokenized him."	
11079,"Was that the creature in rudolf the red nosed reindeer?  The bumble?  I saw that as a kid and it seriously freaked me out.  It scared me.  The stop motion added to the creep factor.  For me it was something that stuck in my head for years afterwards.  Now at 49 its still creepy and yeah I wouldn't want to see it in a dark alley."	
11080,"A whale, it would turn into a whale and i'll die isntantly"	
11081,"YES! A boggart is immediately what I thought of when they started incorporating their individual fears. I can't help but wonder if JK Rowling read this at some point and that's how the idea of a boggart formed."	
11082,"Pennywise's friendliness is basically like a shield. It only works once, before your cover's blown."	
11083,"the worst thing that IT could be is to shape shift into is Chris stuckman wearing a jeremy Jahns disguise trying to give a movie review on as good as jeremy jahns but failing horribly! lololol"	
11084,"If It bleeds... we can kill It."	
11085,"It would turn into an accountant telling me to fill my time sheets for the week"	
11086,"Pinhead  from hellraiser, that will be my worst nigthmare."	
11087,"Once you finish the book, can you do a Spoiler Review of It?:)"	
11088,"Joseph Gordon Lovett would be interesting it see"	
11089,"This movie was way too cheesy for me, not scary at all, and the cgi was terrible, and I've already seen this plot done 1000 times, I think it's over rated"	
11090,"i don´t think that the reason Pennywise did not killed Beverly was because she was not scared, i think that it had to do with the fact that he realized that she is not longer a kid, because right before he was going to killed her he smelled something, it It was supposed to only eat kids at this point, or at least that is what i felt like for me"	
11091,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!. I literally HATE horror movies. But oh my godddd I was SO creeped out by this movie! I was grabbing my boyfriend's arm the whole time and squeezing it,when usually in a horror movie I'm like YAAWWWNNNN. \n\n\nI give this a 9.8 out of 10."	
11092,"Glad to hear you're reading the book, when you finish it can you do a video on it. Thatd be dope"	
11093,"I swear when they do the sequel to It I can totally see Amy Adams playing the grown up version of the red headed girl in this movie"	
11094,"The pharmacy scene where Beverly says the man looks like Clark Kent & he says she's lois lane and everyone in the cinema just cringed and went ew"	
11095,"If you add a bit of film grain to your backgrounds it would get rid of the banding, or some slight noise ~ probably make your videos look cleaner"	
11096,"I would totally love to see you review the book. Have fun with the ending for part 1."	
11097,"Pretty sure this movie gave me PTSD on top of my PTSD\nFucking awesome movie though"	
11098,"I heard it wasn't that good. I heard the IT character really wasn't that scary. Not only that, it gives no explanation as to why this creature has to come out and feed every 27 years.  Any of the other decent horror movies atleast has a reason why they do what they do. Freddie was killed in a furnace, Krampus exists to teach bad children a lesson. What is IT's reason? And if he's a spider again, that's going to be soooo fucking lame! :P"	
11099,"it would turn into taxes or an empty bank account 😔"	
11100,"I am legitimately afraid of fame (no really, I'm actually serious. Not having your own privacy ever again, being stalked by some overly crazy fans to where you feel like your life is threatened, people thinking they have the right to your image, eyes following your every move, taking pictures, not sure whether people love you for the fame or for yourself, never able to be just another face in the crowd again, etc. It's all very terrifying and awful to me. I would work hard my whole life to never be famous).\n\nSo would that mean _It_ would show up in the form of Lady Gaga and tell me I'm going on tour with her?"	
11101,"Pretty sure Jeremy just said the word it a thousand times lol"	
11102,"This movie was fucking ruined for me.\nI haven't been to the theaters since 2015 and i don't plan to ever go again in the future.\nPEOPLE, I PAY TO WATCH A MOVIE IN THEATERS, NOT TO HEAR YOU FUCKS TALK OR HECKLE!!!!\n\nLiterally everyone was laughing like this was a fucking comedy. There was parts where it was dead serious and\npeople couldn't stop laughing. Even had people yelling out comments during the movie. \n\nI'm just going to watch the second movie at home. I hate inconsiderate people!"	
11103,"It turning into a Giant Wasp, Hornet or Yellow Jacket Bees.  That would scare the hell out of me."	
11104,"It is a fucking alien, in the book"	
11105,"What I really like about this movie is how Billy went through the five stages of grief. \n\nDenial-Doesn't believe that Georgie is dead\n\nAnger-Lashes out his friends on not helping him finding Georgie\n\nBargain-Putting his friend's lives on the line all over in finding Georgie\n\nDepression-Both his bargain and anger cost his friendship for a short time.\n\nAcceptance-Accepting the fact that Georgie is dead and shot Pennywise in the forehead while he took the form of Georgie.\n\nSeriously, was anyone on the verge in tears when Georgie was killed, follow by Billy finding Georgie and wanting to go home?"	
11106,"Do u agree that girl in that painting looks like mama?"	
11107,"The thing goes KA KA Ka poom poom , I said the mans not hot !"

11114,"there is one fear that still sometimes freaks me out... and that is the dead mangled Body of Emmett Till. I saw it in school when i was in 6th grade and the teachers had to make sure i was out of the room if they showed it.... sometimes i still have nightmares and that image is there.  OORR... there was a Sherlock Homes mystery exhibit that went around called the Clock tower mystery, and there was a mannequin upside down dead  all chained up in a box.... scariest shit ever!!!!!! if anyone knows what I'm talking about.... that shit was scary to a kid."

11132,"Bryce Dallas Howard better play adult Elizabeth dammit! I wanna see those high heels in action again"

11148,"U have really sexy eyes."	
11149,"The scariest scene in the movie for me was the basement scene where Georgie looked muddy and bloody and how pennywise grabbed his body into the water....this movie was great"

11155,"IT would take the form of a mass of darkness, and all I would see is nothing as I felt and heard various things before IT chewed off my fucking face."	
11156,"I actually found the movie to be pretty sad. Seriously, I felt more sad than scared when the kids were attacked because they were so relatable! I felt so bad for georgie when he was crying"

They are just M A J E S T I C .I cant even have a favorite species.. \nAll cetaceans are cool on their own way: \n\nOrcas are Huge predators but wont prey on humans for some reason.\nBowheads can live up to 200 years and they live on cold polar waters.\nBlue Whales are the biggest animal that ever lived and its vocalization is deafening.\nSperm whales can dive very deep to search for food, sleep verticaly and use sonar to see when there is no light.\nHumpbacks jump over the water, dance with its mate and have the most beautiful vocalization, almost like singing.\nThe List Goes On...\n\nCetaceans are something special."

11299,"Orcas have big jaws with large teeth yet they don't initiate their attack with bites, i guess that's because they don't have claws to grab their prey or pin them down like big cats.  Water is just air, and ocean mammals are quite slippery too, or maybe orcas are gentlemen and ladies, they don't want to dine like thugs like hyenas lol."

11301,"Oh Minke, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Minke!"	
11302,"It's amazing. Killer Whales are truly the apex predators of the sea, because they have no natural predators (not including humans). They are so intelligent, and are even more intelligent than our own dogs and even some apes. \n\nSad that we have to imprison them in asylums for our entertainment."

11584,"I kind of here Jim Henson in this new Kermit voice. Nice work Matt, keep it going."	
11585,"I always loved the rainbow connection song it ages like fine wine and I hope Jim Henson is looking at this and is proud of his creations"	
11586,"Now Kermit doesn't sound so much like Constantine when he sings."	
11587,"I frequently listen to the soundtrack for The Muppet Movie (1979), and Matt legitimately sounds like Jim here to me. I'm officially settled in and content with Matt as Kermit."	
11588,"This song makes me cry, because I am having a hard time with my cat Annie right now. I have a feeling that she is gonna make her rainbow connection soon."	
11589,"I'm going to cry. Kermit is my spirit animal"	
11590,"Thanks for recording this.. I was too busy being in tears from happiness and my love of this amazing show, and my handsome Kermie.. I was so overwhelmed! I still get watery eyed just thinking of how beautiful this was. This night will be forever in my heart! I've done it.. I've seen.. R.e.m., the Monkees, Jason mraz, Penn and Teller, Adam Sandler and now my muppets.. thanks Henson and Disney! I wish life really was this positive and fun! Best night ever! 😂😂😢😂😂😂😙"	
11591,"Somebody put this on TV, that was amazing."	
11592,"he sounds like jim henson"	
11593,"PAUL WILLIAMS! YEAH!"	
11594,"I want Steve Whitmire back SO MUCH, but I have to admit Matt Vogel isn't as terrible as I thought. He kinda sounds like Jim Henson, God rest his soul"	
11595,"OK, so I know everyone including me came to this video to see Matt's singing voice as Kermit, but watch Paul for a minute...is he lip syncing...?"	
11596,"I love that the Muppets can still be so well received so many years after its debut."	
11597,"What's the big frigging deal here. Sounds a llittle like Jim but everyone has their own voice when it comes to voice acting. Im a voice actor but Im not spot on when it comes to voicing William Shatner."	
11598,"I love the new Kermit. His little, Ok? Here we go won me over."	
11599,"It's amazing that the muppets still have a big impact on pop culture to this day. But I imagined that at the climax of the song a hologram projection of Jim Henson walked to Kermit and joined him and everyone else as like a tribute. Also so younger fans can get to know the mastermind of one of the greatest shows of all time"	
11600,"Say what you want about the voice, but the tiny little mannerisms in the hand movements are spot on to Jim"	
11601,"I'm glad that a variety of muppets showed up."	
11602,"Taking my wife and son to tonight's concert!"

11611,"This is amazing! I love his voice he sounds like Jim."	
11612,"Only you Kermit with your beautiful voice, can understand my sorrows."	
11613,"You know I never heard it before but now I think matt vogel sounds more like jim Henson when he sings."	
11614,"I love this song...we sung it at my 6th grade graduation...eons ago"	
11615,"These guys will never grow old to us for sure"	
11616,"The Muppets are just amazing. They are this beautiful experience that every generation can relate to and share with each other. They are timeless. And i wish i could thank Jim personally for allowing me to share my own childhood with my niece and nephew."

11624,"This is amazing!!!"	
11625,"Thank you so much for sharing this.  It makes my heart sing.  <3"	
11626,"I said a while ago I would decide how I felt about Matt when he sung the rainbow connection. Well now he has and I think he's great!"	
11627,"Such an appropriate time to sing about the dreamers.... Great song!"	
11628,"I saw the show on Sunday. It was a very cool experience. This marks the second time that I have seen Rainbow Connection performed live. (The first time was at the 2011 D23 Expo.)"	
11629,"He kinda does sound like Jim."	
11630,"It was the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, not the Philharmoic."	
11631,"I am so psyched to actually see Paul Williams sing this song with the Muppets! :-)"	
11632,"I'd like to take Jade to see the Muppet's could be one of those best days ever. I agree with Sailor Moon animégirl21 makes you feel like you want to meet them."	
11633,"Can we promote this video on the TV show The List - thelisttv.com ? We would give you verbal and graphical courtesy. Let me know, thanks!"	
11634,"Wow. If this is the. New actor or old he does a goood job"	
11635,"It's pigs in space now"

11654,"I saw this tonight, Sunday. It was a great show, this number made me cry. It reminded me of years ago when my Mom was alive."	
11655,"When he sang I immediately thought of the family guy episode where a guy pulls up in a boat and Kermit pulls a shotgun on him"	
11656,"Always this feeling that Constantine is impersonating Kermit ... Also too much prerecorded video sketches and music."	
11657,"His voice is not high enough booo"	
11658,"I'm sorry, but Kermit's new voice sounds too much like Constantine's impression of him."	
11659,"Kermit's new voice is terrible. I understand why they fired Steve Whitmire, but I think they should hire him back."	
11660,"Matt Vogel sounds like Goofy doing a Kermit impression. And don't tell me he sounds like Jim cause he does not. This voice is deeper and has more of a southern twang. And I am not hating Steve never sound like Jim either."	
11661,"Omgghhhhhh that doesn't sound like kermie. Ewww Steve why did you do this to us!"	
11662,"You have this while Disney is doing terrible reboots"	
11663,"His voice is to gurgle-ie"	
11664,"Never thought that one day Constantine would take Kermit`s place !"	
11665,"Muppets haven't been watchable since Jim passed"	
11666,"*i cri*"	
11667,"The fact that the voice of constatine is now the voice of kermit boggles my mind. And I don't like it."	
11668,"#NotmyKermit 😤"	
11669,"You guys... this has to be so hard for Steve to see.  I miss his performance of Kermit. He put a lot of personality into that puppet."	
11670,"The muppets died with Jim. Let them die Disney please and quit using them to make money and push liberal agendas this is cancer"	
11671,"You're telling me they could professionally videotape The Muppet Show Live! From Muppetfest, yet they couldn't do the same thing for this and upload all of it to YouTube?!"	
11672,"I wish they had gotten the guy that's currently doing Kermit. It's clear this is actually the guy who's currently doing Ernie on Sesame Street."

11696,"This was truly SPECTACULAR. Actually one of the most beautiful videos I've ever seen. The night time of the universe was truly awe inspiring. Makes one realize truly how small we are	 a good thing to remember when one has problems they feel are overwhelming. Take ten minutes to watch this and it puts life and its problems and situations quickly in their proper order. Meaning not that important at all. My wife and I love your videos. Thank you for sharing them with us. You do an excellent job and editing is wonderful. Steve Lochmiller from Sacramento area of California."
11697,"This type of videos are amazing!!"	
11698,"WOW thats AMAZING\n\n\nthats a very nice HARD WORK"	
11699,"Utube filled so many depressing and disturbing videos.... Loved this...Thanxx 4 getting up at 4am to capture those beautiful sunrises... I seriously wanna get into the details of ur work and knw more abt this video.. Like ur cameras/the seaexpedition/how u go into tat cargo ship... Evrything i wanna know frm scratch.... Not bcauz i wanna take pics/videos BUT EMBARK ON TAT JOURNEY... This my biggest dream..#SeaFarer...and there is a huge person relation of mine with this beautiful mystic miraculous mesmerizing sea... Inshort itz like this: Unlike mine and my father's generation my ancestors are true fishermen and sea farers... By birth and growth i belong to fishermen Jati...but vth modernity and development creeping in... I can no longer associate to tat Identity of my ancestors vhr my father works in an insurance sector and i one foot in academics and the other carving my own path of career...  All tat remains is jus to fascinate abt it... But still my ancestor's blood flows in me and no wonder i just love those moments vhn i take a walk on those sandy beaches of the ocean / rocky terrains of river beds/ lakebeds.... That sight at those pristine waters in its all blue... Tat gushing moisturised wind bathing my face and blowing my hair...JUST LOVE TAT...even now i stare at tat vision vth the wonder and curiosity of a child... Its like i am completely zapped by tat moment... Only on these occasions i love for the person i am and thngs i do...as i feel tat nothingness vhn i face a sea and tat innocence of a child like creeps into me... Those waves of water itz just like purging me.. The rest of the time i jus shun thyself...  So i immensely love boat rides... Seas.. Oceans...as of now my love and passion for this is only allowed and encouraged to those tiny 15-20mins boat rides/long walks near the lakes... But vhn my responsibilities r ovr...SeaFaring is all i yearn.... Awww man luk at those thousands of stars and tat beautiful play of colours on the night sky and tat music of water waves... Those highs and lows of the waves approaching the ship... The carefree drifting clouds... Those gentle/rough winds... Those rainwaters... And tat eternal like silence.... My existence is reduced to a tiny speck of dot in front of this beautiful creation... I feel so little and humbled... Wish ppl around me understand this"	
11700,"That was stunning. Not often you see something from a totally new perspective. Well done. I thought it would be very cool to see a video like this from the prow of the ship too - as if you were flying across the ocean :)"	
11701,"The most beautiful video i ever seen, thank you."	
11702,"how do you keep your camera on for 30 days? and what kind of memory card do u use?"	
11703,"Absolutely beautiful! Thank you for all the effort it took to put this together and share it with the world, I appreciate it!"

11715,"Great video, I just wished we could watch it in it's purity without the subtitles of what's what."	
11716,"It is truly beautiful."	
11717,"Truly awe inspiring. This is why YouTube exists: to show your world to others. Think of the millions of other shipping containers working their way around the world now.\n\nAre the straps on the bottom containers used to anchor them to the deck?"	
11718,"Amazing! 4:40 and 8:13 I want to witness that everyday in my life. I miss my own amazing sky. Uplifting timelapse"	
11719,"This is the best video on the internet. Thank you for it. Is there anyway I can get the full video without the text so I can turn it into a screen saver?"	
11720,"I've never seen anything that so completely filled me with such wonder and awe and joy! Well done!"	
11721,"Did you found the one piece?"	
11722,"Truly awesome experience, something I think a lot of folks would enjoy.  I spent quite a few years working in Freight Forwarding, it was nice to see a full ship voyage, thanks for making this video."	
11723,"Just for your channel mate, and as a person who has always been fascinated by ships in general, I really enjoy your content. But I have one question, you think it would be possible to get a pic of the deck plans of the ship? I got this game where I build stuff in (Minecraft if you know about it ) and I've done quite a lot of ships in the past, so it would be so cool to see the layout of all the rooms and such in the ship :)"	
11724,"This is amazing. I want to see it in theaters. Music, photos, captioning was all so fluid and I find it hard to critique. I feel small and impressed. Great job, Jeff."	
11725,"Amazing.. Spectacular !! This is so relaxing.. great choice of background score as well. Truly Awesome work. Keep it up man !!"

11734,"Probably my favorite video in all of the interwebs.  Well done.  So cool to see life from such an interesting perspective."	
11735,"Amazing.  Your videos are so eye opening to the world that is out there."	
11736,"This is totally amazing.....great work here"

11739,"I'm just wondering who the 192 a-holes who down voted this video are?  Amazing piece of work.  Thank you so much for sharing!"	
11740,"Very good work! \nThoroughly enjoyed watching it on a large 4K screen."	
11741,"Watching this while listening to riders of the storm by the doors is quite mindblowing"	
11742,"Wow the colors are spectacular and all natural!"	
11743,"Holy Crap this was awe inspiring loved this, it was so relaxing. Would love if you captured more."	
11744,"That is just stunning!  I've watched it 3 times back to back already.  Do you have a blog post or soemthing where you go in greater details on how you did this?  Curious on delay between shots, how you managed to feed power to the camera, etc etc etc.  In any case, amazing idea and edition.  LOVED IT! :)"	
11745,"One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen! Just amazing wow"	
11746,"Wow! This is fantastic! What a great documentary!"	
11747,"I don't usually get erection from watching videos on YouTube, but i just did. Bravo!"	
11748,"By the constantly distracting captioning and brand mark, no one is truly watching the video, it made me shut off an otherwise intriguing video, seriously, have u ever heard the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Let me experience it without a bunch of distracting BS! Does anyone get it anymore?"	
11749,"That's a lot of water."	
11750,"ThE eArTh Is FlAt"	
11751,"I am speechless. This was fascinating, awesome and yet sobering at the same time. The beauty of the ocean is awesome The loneliness of the long days at sea is sobering. That is one of the best YouTube videos I have seen in years. It does make you feel a bit small and insignificant when you put the world's oceans in perspective. I think this helps people understand the vastness of the water on this plant. I am afraid that people forget about the importance of the oceans until they make the news. On the other hand people will say there is so much ocean why should we be concerned. The night shots were beautiful. I would find myself standing out at night craning my neck to watch the universe go by. \n\nThough I have to say one of the thoughts that kept coming to mind was:  does it get lonely being out at sea for so long? What is the longest you have spent at sea during one stretch? How do you keep busy when not on shift? One stupid question does the ship ever become empty of containers? I actually have about a thousand other questions but that will do for now. Last thing please post more this was wonderful. I have watched it three times so far."	
11752,"breathtaking ..thank you so much for sharing !!"	
11753,"Ouahou ! Very nice video, wonderful ! I like it very much and it's interesting. Thanks for that."	
11754,"That is one of the most awesome and fantastic videos I've ever seen! thank you a lot for this!"	
11755,"Well done.  Great chance for those of us who don't venture out on the seas what that experience is like. (My Dad was in the Navy so I really enjoyed this)."	
11756,"Great idea, and a beautiful video !"	
11757,"Really cool! The notes you included in the video were helpful as well. How much memory did it take for the full timelapse?"	
11758,"Fantastic timelapse man! Love the way the light transitions between day and night!"	
11759,"This is stunning and makes me homesick for the sea...."	
11760,"Love your channel in specific really admire this video. Makes me want to Work on a ship."	
11761,"I have no words to describe the beauty of this video. 😱😍"	
11762,"Dude, can you please issue this video without the subtitles?"	
11763,"You should do a tutorial on how u did this I'm interested to see what setting u used"

11818,"Where are his eyebrows"	
11819,"What are some good lip gloss dupes for Rihanna's universal lip gloss?"	
11820,"This is the reason I stopped watching YT . . ."	
11821,"Wow you are fast as lightning! I just found out yesterday about her new line and read about the story on how there weren't enough different shades to suit skin of color or different varieties. Glad I watched your video! to get a better idea on if it's worth the splurge."	
11822,"You are in front of a Picasso!"	
11823,"A racist reviewing a black woman's makeup line? Hmmmmmnnnn. OK. Commence the usual hypocrisy and dick riding."	
11824,"This is the review I was waiting for. lol"	
11825,"i know makeup has no rules but omfg that gold highlight is not for fair skin it is a lot more for poc!!!"	
11826,"That girl on his neck is so lucky! 😭"	
11827,"i realy want to try this stuff but in my country we can not find any thing 😣"	
11828,"The collection is beautiful"	
11829,"I know you probably get a lot of messages but Morphe is selling your products off their website and I was wondering if they're actually authentic and you gave them permission to sell them."	
11830,"Anyone I need all the prayers I can get please and Thankyou"	
11831,"How didn't he love the gloss?!?! I looooooove it so much it's so gorgerous 😍😍"

11834,"I love the way he talks"	
11835,"Are they cruelty free? If so, im gonna try them foundations! 😍"	
11836,"Why when he said here from New York city at the end I shouted IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!!😂😂💀"	
11837,"Wtf is he talking that primer is little high tf he really needs to stfu like Mark Jacob primer and make up line primer is higher than that"	
11838,"Just when I thought it was going to be easy to save my money Rihanna goes and launches a bunch of make up whyyyy"	
11839,"he threw shade to the kardashian/Jenner clan lol"	
11840,"I love you jefree ! Watch your videos always ! Love the review ! Your so real and your taste in quality and makeup is amazing 💖😘"

11842,"look so amazing 😍😍 subscribe me guys for video ⚘❤❤"	
11843,"Brand by a black woman ? Seems legit"	
11844,"Your skin looks as smooth as butter. You matched your color perfectly. Her line is definitely going to be around for years to come."	
11845,"The highlight is everything 😍😍😍 trophy wife omllll"	
11846,"I love you Jeffree ❤️ you are my fav guru!"	
11847,"It is really bothering me that he has a drink sitting on his laptop next to the bed"	
11848,"Because you know I wanna look as plastic and fake as possible ily 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"	
11849,"so disappointed he called  black people niggars no more support form me your a 🤡 fuck u with ur👻👻 KKK ass"	
11850,"The gold highlight would look so sexy on someone with epic shoulders and shoulder blades as a body highlight"	
11851,"I'm loving the brushes! I don't wear foundation. Love the highlighter. Like the lipgloss..."	
11852,"You shouldn't even be able to fucking review this"	
11853,"Haha you are so dope babe now I gotta go get some products cuz you looked gorgeous in them 🙌🏽"	
11854,"I remembered Jeffree being like at least three shades lighter... I guess he's got a tan but I still don't feel like that shade of foundation matches his actual skin tone"	
11855,"The title hit or miss 😂😂😂 that shouldn't even be in Discussion it's a hittttt👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾"	
11856,"any chance you could review Bella Pierre \nI would love to find more information about it , from the one and only.\nespecially to see if its worth the price tag.\n xoxo"	
11857,"First time I've ever watched a video of him. Made me want to die more than I already did"	
11858,"You look so beautiful and classy with your hair! I love your craziness ❤️"	
11859,"Can I just say where the fuck are his brows 😂"	
11860,"man that highlight brush is something else"	
11861,"I think the gloss, was flippin amazing! It's hard get  a hue easily in gloss instead of an actually shade...translucent with sheer color, loved it!"	
11862,"Someone as racist as him doesn't deserve to use makeup by riri and her black girl magic ✊🏾✋🏾"	
11863,"I want someone to love me like Jeffree loves highlighting."	
11864,"I really don't see the big deal I'm just sayin"	
11865,"But can we talk about your hair. Looks so good."	
11866,"That foundation looked AMAZING! It definitely looked like it set on its own which is amazing for clients who don't want to wear powder. The only thing that scares me about the GLASS packaging is that as a TRAVELING Makeup Artist, some of those products might break. I learned my lesson from some of the Nars foundations."	
11867,"for a second, i thought the background music was bst, mianhae"	
11868,"Please make up of Tyra banks"	
11869,"It looks dark and orangish. Really oxidized to me. I hate oxidation! Not a detractor or fan of Rhianna but I love anyone who works this hard to fulfill the major hole that most makeup companies ignore. That is finding a foundation for women of color!! So happy for my girls who can now check out some colors that can work for them without having to use a bunch of darkeners to ensure a color match! About time!"	
11870,"You looked like an oompa loompa at the end of the video. I think it oxidized A LOT. 2 shades lighter is the way to go i think."	
11871,"BULLSHIT talm bout how you're not about no lightweight packaging.. you sure did love Kim K's ziplock baggie"	
11872,"I don't know why I fell that Jeffrey is keeping coments because he is like kinda involved in to the line , because he is not acting like always , I don't know , let me now if I'm not the only one"	
11873,"I OWN GLOSS ITSSS STUNNING"	
11874,"pls....pls do your eyebrows"	
11875,"Amazing!!!!"	
11876,"He Talks Like Joey Graceffa"	
11877,"Fuck you bitch!"	
11878,"❤❤❤❤"	
11879,"When he mentioned Women Of Color , I don't care what ANYONE says i still love Jeffree"	
11880,"I screamed when he put on Trophy Wife! Brb gotta go order it asap! It's so beautiful 💖😍😍😍"	
11881,"Jeffree is the level of rich I'm trying to be"	
11882,"Fenty is has hands down worlds best highlighter so far"	
11883,"U have all of them?"	
11884,"Y'all need to invite a poor person like me to these premiers So my broke ass... can get some free stuff....."	
11885,"Rihanna is really going off right now! She did the damn thing ....   I am so proud of her!!!"	
11886,"Yasss. I think the metal moon looks better on fair, tan and pale skin and I think trophy wife look better on brown/black skin 😍😍 I love it tho"	
11887,"Omg I saw James Charles review ( I love him) but Jeffree did a WAYYYY better review . Nothing seemed to work correctly on James"	
11888,"Jeffree should do a full makeup look on one of his face tattoos 😂"	
11889,"I feel like that foundation color doesn't match..."	
11890,"Ew paŕece un ceŕdo jaja😂"	
11891,"Fkn racist gay bitch"	
11892,"ORGANIC / NATURAL MAKEUP REVIEW ( WHOLEFOODS!!!!)"	
11893,"This made me happy for a minute. I just lost my home due to Irma in Florida. My kids and I are homeless right now. Thank you for getting my mind off of this for a few minutes ❤️"	
11894,"Can we just take a second to admire his cheek bones and the fact that he has NO FUCKING PORES"	
11895,"Jeffreestar: Lets test it with the flashlight\nMe:(blind)😂😂"	
11896,"You can't fool me with all you're techno jargon.  It's witchcraft plain and simple!"	
11897,"Nice Youtube. I've been thinking for a long time that microwave could be used for speaker feedback. This would work with just a comparator. I haven't been able to build it, not my field, but nice to know something like this exists."	
11898,"Step 1: Draw some eldritch symbols on the copper layer of a pcb.\nStep 2: Put some components randomly on that pcb.\nStep 3: Make an offering to the microwave god.\nStep 4: Profit!"	
11899,"Physics is very interesting subject indeed! your videos have quality and my best wishes for the channel to have million subscribers."	
11900,"Great video Kerry. Assuming it can tune below 10.5 Ghz I see the foundation for an amateur transceiver."	
11901,"Thank you for sharing Kerry, very interesting. I know nothing about this subject, now I want to know more. Best regards, Joel"	
11902,"Kerry, fantastic. I love it. I know nothing of this field. You lifted the curtain enough that I have vocabulary to learn more. Many thanks."	
11903,"Hate crime, racism, anti-Semitism and misogyny.....all you needed was xenophobia or islamophobia and you would have had Feminist Bingo....better luck next time guys."	
11904,"Buttom line... Stephen King can be pretty fucked up to put it mildly."	
11905,"So basically Penywise is just an excuse for Stephen King to write a book about child sex and gore? I'm... starting to think maybe this guy isn't someone I should respect. \nWhatever a writer writes about, the subject matter can be inspired, but ultimately the content of the book is a revealing insight into the mind of the writer... Which means he was writing about 12 year old children having sex, in great detail... he actually planned that shit in advance. \n\nI wonder how many other famous pop culture icons are secretly pedos and  serial kilers. A hell of a lot more than we would think is probably the answer."	
11906,"Now do the mini-series VS the movie. xD"	
11907,"Really interested if you all are going to look at the 2017 not-John-Hughes IT."	
11908,"Why do the Beverley in the 2017 vers. have sex with all the boys in the group? That's so DISGUSTING AND VILE that a image of pre-teen GANGBANG just conjured up in my mind. Did the reviewers said they all had sex in the sewers? That just made it WORSE for me now. I gotta to get this out my mind, probably going to watch the original movie again."	
11909,"good intentions\nbut seems a bit dumbed down..."	
11910,"Due to budget issues they had to leave to letters out of the title."	
11911,"They did mike hanlon so bogus in the new movie"	
11912,"Would you like it in alphabetical order????"	
11913,"Who is this chick? Fuck she ruins what was going to be an incredible episode. I genuinely can't tell if she's trying to do a Pennywise high-pitched clown voice for comedic purposes or if that's her actual voice. Either way, she's got a voice for modeling."	
11914,"Seeing the old clips it seems they even brought back the odd lip-syncing for Pennywise, as if the lines were added later. Dunno if that's supposed to be intentional for both movies since It's a cosmic horror, but..."	
11915,"So the only female in the club in the book is a slut. I mean sure the sex orgy was a bonding ritual, but essentially the girl banged more than one boy. Worse in one sequence: one after the other. How did she not get pregnant?"	
11916,"IT is not a demon, but a cosmic being or eldritch abomination like Cthulhu or Gozer from Ghostbusters."

11925,"the dead kid and the picture of Georgie is pretty much like this in the book. The 85 murders begin and then as Mike builds up the evidence to be sure to call his paws one of the things that makes him certain that it's It they are dealing with is the picture of Georgie that disappeared in 58 after it winked at bill"

11932,"With the notable exception of Carrie the only really good adaptations of Stephen King's novels are the non-supernatural ones."	
11933,"Based on the mini series, IT's powers seem to be based in subjective or perceived reality. The silver works because they know it works, the asthma inhaler works when they are kids when he thinks it's acid, then as an adult when he knows its mostly water it doesn't work.\n\nA similar system was actively used by the citizens of Elm St in Freddy vs. Jason. The people suppressed all knowledge of Freddy and his killings and eventually that stripped him of his powers. I don't know if it was an intentional reference to IT though."	
11934,"I like the miniseries. It's cheesy but charming and Mike's arc isn't given to a white character. The woman talking sounds like she has a bubble in her throat but good video"

11944,"Correction: It were THREE bullies that were involved with throwing the homosexual man over the bridge."	
11945,"...And this is why I've never felt inclined to pick up one of his novels. Yeah, they're LONG books... but people don't read books just to say they've carried around a giant weight with words inside and looked at them all. The book trailer or little blurb won't win you over unless you are a die-hard horror fan, maybe. When it comes to what you hear about them outside of that? They sound dull, gross, and pretentious at the same time. I don't see the appeal."

11950,"The difference to me.... The first was awesome with great acting. The second was lame, not scary at all & Pennywise wasn't half the clown Tim Curry was. Why choose a pretty boy to play what was suppose to be such a scary part? IT from the 90s wins, hands down! Very disappointed in this new one."

11964,"I'm pretty sure Pennywise is the Crimson King, or have I got that wrong?"	
11965,"I don't get King's idea of having a orgy be some way to make the group come together. If anything, it just means she is the one that keeps their love bind together. So if she dies, there's no bind that keeps them together."	
11966,"One of the hugest elements of the novel that was left out of the mini-series was the creepy abandoned house on the dead end street where the kids encounter maybe the most over the top psychological and metaphysical horror of the whole novel. This segment of the book is totally left out that's too bad because I've always considered it maybe the creepiest portion of the novel. In conclusion, the novel is simply so massive in its scope and unrelenting horror nastiness that it will never be successfully adapted to film."	
11967,"if you folks doing film blade runner and the novel 1968 do androids dream of electric sheep next use the 2009-2011 comic book by boom studios it's based on the novel it contains the full complete text of the novel illustrated by tony parker."

11976,"The original one is not even the slightest bit scary."	
11977,"Do a diy costume for 2017 it"	
11978,"I have to commend you for not throwing a fit that the miniseries couldn't include everything in the book. You are right when you say its basically a faithful adaptation, and stuff was cut either for time, a broader audience, or creative decisions. People today expect an adaptation to CLING to the source material which shouldn't be the norm. Great video."	
11979,"The new IT is awesome"	
11980,"Actually you guys are wrong. A girl did get murdered and grown up Mike Hanlon did found a picture of Georgie near the crime scene. The picture has been missing since Bill and Richie went back to check Georgie's moving and winking picture. Finding this photo is in fact the deciding factor for Mike to believe that IT did returned and called up the others. This is quite important in the book and the picture had driven a lot of flash back so I don't know how you could have missed it if you did read the book."

12002,"Big misconception that the miniseries also takes place in 1958. As with the current film it was moved forward a bit, though not as drastically. Book is 1958 - 1985 and the miniseries is 1960 - 1990."

I haven't been here for the whole process as a lot of organic reactions are a bit too complex for an amateur-amateur like me.\nBut anyone can see it's worth celebrating when you come out of two years research with a big green tick in the checkbox.\nKeep up the great work... you are the one person who made me realise that YouTube wan't just about pirated music videos and people hiding turds in each others lunchboxes."

12030,"Congrats on the success! I have to echo sediment here. Get this thing published, if only to thumb your nose at Pharma. That and the sodium metal discovery.\n\nNow, for future projects, why not something a little more light-hearted? It be awesome to see you come up with some experiments that are for kids, or can be done by kids. Get the next generation excited about science!"

12046,"Thanks for the series! I don't understand much of the formulas you present but it has been intriguing for me to watch the progress. Could you shed a light (on another video?) how these chemical formulas are formed i.e when you mix something, how do you know what will happen and what will be the result and how to write the reaction to paper?"	
12047,"can you try and make acetaminophen"	
12048,"I would like to see a commentary about the whole process and where things failed or where things can be done better. Things that where fun and things that where a wee bit crazy."

I have been following this for the whole time and wish I could see all the failures. I am a chem student and would be interesting. I know that most people aren't chem majors but hey thats why we have youtube where we can see really specific content and don't have to worry about things being dumbed down so the average idiot who is afraid of math can understand. Thanks for the inspiration I plan on doing similar things with my new found knowledge."

12073,"Well done!  In my opinion, it's been worth all the effort you've put in.  I've watched each video from start to finish & have enjoyed it all.  Even though I haven't any background in chemistry - outside of high school - I'm still fascinated by it.  Keep up the great work!"	
12074,"Congratulations for your achievements! You have been so inspiring to me that I have started to study chemistry in university :) Because chemicals here in EU regions are very controlled, it's hard to get anything like you have as a easily available domestic chemical and because of that, being amateur chemist in EU region is pretty hard. So it's nice to see real chemical syntheses and experimentations."

In other areas of the world it is available as a generic and costs as little as 0.05 to 0.10 USD per dose._ *Something is seriously wrong, when your method described here is cheaper then it was in the US.*"

12122,"Bannon is spot on. I'm so glad this guyband Trump are friends."	
12123,"People reflected back to what Clinton did to women!"

12125,"Its no wonder America & that whole WORLD want him DEAD......"	
12126,"I must say, I am disappointed. Though I am not surprised, he isn't any brighter than the idiot president. Demagogue, in the flesh."	
12127,"The more I hear this guy talk, the more I like him. I actually think it might help Trump and his agenda if he (Bannon) is on the outside calling it like it is. Time will tell."	
12128,"I heard he is slated to be the sexiest man alive 2018!"

12134,"Doubles down in shirts as well."	
12135,"Many of the things Steve says are exaggerations, armchair quarterbacking, or provably false. I do however agree with his assertion that China is in an economic war with the US while we sit back like idiots."	
12136,"What the establishment media keep trying to impress upon people is an emphasis on the idea of condoning groping women. What Bannon is focusing on is that in order to beat back the establishment, including those on the right/GOP, you have to not fall for the billy bush trap, you have to move forward and keep going. That in order to fix crisis you need not get buried in these assume the worst scenarios that do nothing but serve to defend the establishment through their media outlets pretending they care about anything but securing theirselves a position of power. And they'll use your social awareness as a weapon against anyone to achieve it when they could care less as long as the govt positions are secured."	
12137,"You can hate him but you gotta admire him."	
12138,"CBS just lost me with this evil deed of coloring Steve Bannon to look evil. This is horrible of 60 minutes we so trusted. Very​ dishonest. WHY??"

12140,"Trump and Bannon are defending our great nation and its citizens from a system of corruption that goes well beyond evil.......the American political system has been planted with pedophile scumbag politicians who never were elected by the people but rather a fraudulent election system.... where voting equipment is hacked and Illegal aliens vote by the millions .... dead people vote by the millions....this to name a few aspects of an American election system gone totally left and corrupted to its core...created  to service and elect politicians that are willing to sell out our American values and heritage plus loot our great nation economically.....Obama was there super star .....elected by a fraudulent voting system and propped up by the fake news .......this scenario has been exposed .......Obama was a traitor and more over a terrorist !! We as Americans must now change the landscape in our election system.... root out deception and destroy the cancerous core that has produced so many false prophets in our great nation.........Thank you Steve Bannon and Donald Trump for exposing what many have died trying to expose for many decades.........We will make America Great Again and the Patriots are rising to this cause ..................In God We Trust and MAGA !!!\nShow less\nREPLY"	
12141,"Overrated, unqualified, failed POS taking out his frustrations about himself with the world. Don't give this man a platform to voice his bloody nonsense. Did this piece of crap spawn? Disgusting with no moral bearings. Would sell his mother and daughter for his 15 min of fame. Wanted to look like a king maker but ended up being a failure."	
12142,"I like this guy. He looks really high."	
12143,"so he's Irish hahaha not even American lol."	
12144,"Bannon was right, because at the end of the day there's not a man or woman on the planet that can look back and honestly say that they haven't said something deeply inappropriate in private. Maybe Ned Flanders is off the hook, but that's about it."	
12145,"Hope you guys saw how Charlie Rose was very defensive in this"	
12146,"Bannon must have learned a thing or two from Squealer (Orwell's Animal Farm)."	
12147,"Why do I get this Dallas vibe from this man? He reminds me of someone that would go up against J.R. over oil lol"	
12148,"Steve, Move to Whitefish for good !"	
12149,"This guy is really smart	 that's why the Media hate him so much..."
12150,"Locker room talk. I mean he confessed to harassing someone."	
12151,"Still saying that was locker room talk...lol .i don't  think he was in a locker room"	
12152,"Bannon really gets it. I wish he were still in the White House."	
12153,"YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE ABOUT THESE INTERVIEWS?  When they CUT THE SENTENCES AND FULL STATEMENTS to frame it the way the producers want you to see it.  You can CLEARLY SEE the EDITORS (if you are real news.....why edit my statements?) keep cutting Steve's sentences."	
12154,"Why does he look high?"	
12155,"sounds like charlie rose is taking it personal."	
12156,"So glad the racial demographics are changing in the America. These white Christian terrorist need to go 😎🇺🇸"	
12157,"I did not know much of Steve Bannon other than what the extremely left leaning liberal press had reported on him.  That being said after watching this interview I love the guy.  Keep up the good work Steve.  I loved these quotes of his...Steve Bannon to Chris Christie - ...You're not on the plane you're not on the team, He didn't make the plane...  Also ...I don't need to be lectured by a bunch of limousine liberals from the upper East Side and the Hamptons...  A direct slap in the face to Charlie Rose and all the higher ups at CBS.  Love it!  What a pair of brass balls on this guy."	
12158,"Bannon has begun holding private meetings with insurgent challengers, vowing his support. He’s coordinating with conservative mega-donor ROBERT MERCER, who is prepared to pour millions of dollars into attacks on GOP incumbents. Bannon has also installed a confidant at an outside group that is expected to target Republican lawmakers and push the Trump agenda. The Mercer family is running the WH."	
12159,"Serious comment - does he have pink eye?"	
12160,"*There's a side of Charlie Rose & David PacKman that's pure EVIL.*"	
12161,"DemoKKKrats."	
12162,"Rose comes out smelling like a rose.. fertilizer."	
12163,"He's wearing a black suit jacket on top of a black button up on top of a black button up...why?"	
12164,"Go away un-American Charlie Rose you belong in the swamp with Chuck and Mccain!"	
12165,"This guy know how to handle the hysterical media you just don't back down"	
12166,"Kills me how they talk about blind loyalty. It's was the msm is doing everyday!"	
12167,"All of us off white people were abused by the Romans and the Turks. When the Europeans found out we were not pure white the beat us and nearly killed us all. Off White is out of sight! We need to be as violent as everyone else to show off white need special treatment too. Death to all colors but mine (and the green people of course) we hate racist brown, black, yellow, red, and white peoples of the Earth. What I hated most they would kick us and call us as the puppy word, I hate being called puppy and kicked by all the evil racist white, black, red, yellow, and the worst were the brown people. Sana Anna killed almost all of us who were in Mexico. Genocide' he was a tyrant killer. Up with off white down with the rest of the world. Oh yea we believe in raping and robbing everyone. It's just in our Genes. We do not have an ability to follow laws that were not written by any non-off white so we do not obey your laws. Can I get some money now? Some free housing? I just need bus money. Off White Lives Matter...More!\nWe once had a beautiful mountain kingdom everybody loved one another and we were seen as very successful by all the other kingdoms. The valley people wanted our riches, we told them we would gladly share them. It wasn't enough for the people below to share in our success and they invaded us killing everyone.\nAfter the valley people defeated us they dug into the mountain in search of our treasure, what did they find?"	
12168,"Bannon was right on the money! Funny Liberals trying to play all moral, and high. You people talk about blind loyalty, what about supporting Hilary? You liberals are out of touch with reality!"	
12169,"Irish🙄they should have just sticked to be in a bar drinking"

12430,"Who waching in 2017"	
12431,"some people seem to assume that this guy is making these facial expressions out of humor during  very traumatic time. Exaggerated facial expressions are forms of grammar necessary in Sign Language to make sure those who need it understand the severity of the situation. It may seem funny to us but its fairly common for this to be done. I think its awesome and I can totally see the humor and if people take that, thats cool but understand this isn't being done to mock or joke about the situation. He is doing his job as best as he could and I feel he did it brilliantly."	
12432,"To all viewers who do not know American Sign Language:I am deaf and use American Sign Language (ASL). This guy is doing a fantastic job of interpreting for the deaf! His facial adverbs equate with the spoken inflection and gravity of the emergency situation. Hurricane Irma is a serious threat and it cannot be taken lightly. This certified deaf interpreter just conveyed that."	
12433,"His facial expressions enhanced his explaining.....I thought he explained this dam good."	
12434,"He's a Cerified deaf interpreter (CDI). He does not hear the noises he's making. How it works is a hearing interpreter sits in front of the deaf interpreter and signs what is being said. The Deaf interpreter then interprets that into American Sign Language. Deaf interpreters are used because a native user/speaker of a language can convey the meaning clearer than a non-native native signer. Deaf interpreters are the best choice in a emergency situation (and many other situations) to meet the communication needs of the entire Deaf Community. There are different dialects of sign language. This interpreter interpreted the information in a way that any deaf person can understand...which is the point."	
12435,"I would like this guy to translate everything I say."	
12436,"This guy just made about 900 GIFs."	
12437,"This guy is the next internet meme."	
12438,"ROTFLMFAO - With all of the horrible news of the hurricane, THIS GUY brings forth a new way to watch these otherwise gloomy news conferences"	
12439,"Oh my goodness, I know this is serious and all but they found the Italian De Niro Sign Language Guy :)"	
12440,"adding some humour during a crisis lol love this guy"	
12441,"..You hoax people know nothing first  in some cause 's they use facial expression  like in Florida ..Know the  facts before you credits some thing that you know nothing about . sing langue"	
12442,"You should probably amend that to Gov Rick Scott gives a warning with ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter, emphasizing the seriousness the situation for the deaf/hard of hearing audience.  There IS a difference - putting deaf first implies that the interpreter cannot hear, which is obviously false since he is listening to Gov Scott and interpreting into signs.\n\nEdited to add:  I saw Pam's comment. I stand corrected."	
12443,"Is this like Dolby surround sound for the deaf?"	
12444,"People don't realize that he isn't being overly enthusiastic or anything like that. This is just sign language. That is what sign language looks like. You use facial expressions like a hearing person might use vocal pitch. I love ASL so much becasue of that!"	
12445,"Honestly I never knew sign language includes facial expressions, now I know."	
12446,"This guy loves his job."	
12447,"It's funny because he's not trying to be funny, he's just trying to be as clear and expressive as possible."	
12448,"Yeah, I know that chick. Crazy in the head and crazy in the bed."	
12449,"He thought governor was talking about an ex wife."	
12450,"HE FORGOT THE 7 IN THE PHONE NUMBER- EPIC FAIL?"	
12451,"Pause at 0:58, hilarious with his tongue out. Yes, I'm well aware that's the only way to emphasize in sign language, but still, it's funny. But what's even funnier is what is the point of all the men just standing around the governor like statues, it's pointless. Just have governor Scott and the signer up there."	
12452,"He's one of a few that caught my eye.  I agree, he's a great bit of humorous uplift in times of such gravity.  Highly likely that he signs this exact way every time he signs - no matter who is watching."	
12453,"Check this IRMA HURRICANE HUMOR ONE LOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q04H0Z1L-zY"	
12454,"i farted awww"	
12455,"👌👌👌молодец"	
12456,"That Face !!"	
12457,"my 4 year daughter want to see this video again and again. More sucess than Disney's  Frozen. What is the name of this guy, i want his version of   Dunkerke and Star Wars."	
12458,"WTF did I just watch? How did the governor make it through his speech with that going on next to him? This guy reminds me of Mr. Bean."	
12459,"He is the real deal and he is good.  He is a CDI.  I recently took a workshop he taught. To the untrained eye, his facial expressions are funny or weird.  But to native signers, those facial expressions are the most important part of the language.  They are the equivalent of vocal tone and punctuation.  Interpreting students have to learn these facial expressions.  It takes months -> years to learn this.  You want funny, you should see a class of new interpreters practicing facial expressions.  Also, there is a lot of work here.  The speaker, the off camera interpreter (who can hear) signing to him, so he can interpret the msg. and sign it in ASL. W/O facial expressions he's like a monotone speaker who says uh every other word.  Chinese sounds funny to me too, but that's because I don't know the language."	
12460,"If you think that's funny, you should see the sign language guy for blind people!"	
12461,"Thanks for signing the phone number so I can call and talk to....oh wait.."	
12462,"I don't know what's funnier, the mime guy or the gubner wearing a baseball cap."	
12463,"The interpreter is awesome. What's his full name? Does anyone know?"	
12464,"this just needs some beats. 🎵"	
12465,"He was clearly mocking the governor, how can you guys not see that?"	
12466,"Just like the global warming scam, this guy proves these deaf people have just been fucking with us all along.  *waves arms wildly*"	
12467,"This has to be some nut that pretended to be the sign language guy or whatever they are. This is like a SNL skit. There's no way this was real"	
12468,"I think this is over the top. It distracts the viewer from listening to the important message given by the Governor. How can a serious message possibly be 'translated' by such weird facial expressions? His expressions don't seem to match the words."	
12469,"Is the tongue really necessary"	
12470,"I am deaf. His expression is not funny, it is the expression of seriousness of the hurricane and he is signing in true ASL that covers all levels of communication of the deaf. There are level of communication that come within the culture where there are spectrum of deaf level of understanding. It appears whoever post this lacks understanding of the deaf culture and it's situation. I assume you are hearing and do understand that you see only the expression and not it's signs that are visual and representable to the context of the language and situation that is happening that could save the lives of the deaf community. I hope this provides an insight to change your title of the topic of the video."	
12471,"This guy should do stand ups!!!"	
12472,"Is that real sign language or is this guy clowning around making gibberish?"	
12473,"Iam sure he is just making it up lol"	
12474,"Fake."	
12475,"Just watching his facial expressions and the noises he makes are too funny!!"	
12476,"I've got an Alcatel pop 4 .It's pretty good for 70 quid. This a30 fierce is markedly better. Better camera for sure"

12676,"I am *amazed* that none of that stuff was *stolen* . In the USA, it would be gone in *2-3 minutes* . Especially cellphones and labtops."	
12677,"Oh and another thing: just this morning I was taking the ferry to uni in Venice, sitting next to some Japanese people. They left for a moment, leaving on their seat their camera and their umbrella! They literally left their Nikon camera on an unattended seat, you don't do that in Italy 😅"	
12678,"In Singapore we mainly use packets of tissue paper or namecards!"	
12679,"In my city, those belongings are definitely gone in minutes!"	
12680,"In my country if you leave your phone or anything on the table and go for 1 minute it will disappear like magic"	
12681,"Try that in the Philippines I dare you! You don't have to leave your valuables for it to be stolen from you. Or your life as well. #Pinoypride #reality"	
12682,"Could do a video about bicycles in Japan? I just looked up bike jail and it sounds like a very Japanese concept. In a good way. I just heard on the news today that bike theft has gone up by more than 13% in my region as bikes get more expensive and people tend to report more."	
12683,"I've had my car broken into once. Luckily I did not leave any items of true personal value in the car that day. The thief/thieves must have been pissed caused they grab every pointless thing in the car.  They were so desperate they even took my spare tire in the trunk...joke was on them though, that tire has been flat for weeks...LOL!!!!!!! I would love to have seen their faces when they found out. LOL!!!"	
12684,"Its awsome that they dont ask to subscribe at the end of the video!!"	
12685,"In Poland (and probbably in most other countries) it is common to save your spot by putting a shirt or a coat, an umbrella or a bag. Yet you should not leave any valuables (also in said bag) as they might get stolen. Also, the things that you leave still do not grant you that you will keep that seat as others may relocate your stuff to a different free spot that may not be as great as the previous one (views for example)."	
12686,"In my part of the world , they have a saying : \n Gear adrift is a gift .... \n\nAnything left laying about will go missing almost immediately . \n\nYou are careful about showing valuable items when using them ... someone might rob you . \nEspecially high-dollar items like expensive watches , jewelry , cellphones , laptops , etc . \n\nYou never leave children unattended , as kids come up missing all the time . \nHeck , adults get kidnapped and held for ransom or murdered here . \nDrug cartel members have gun-battles on the streets . \n\n You keep a close eye on everyone around you . \n\nI have thwarted a couple of robberies simply by being aware and prepared . \nAvoiding being caught in what was an obvious set-up . \n\nScammers , thieves and robbers are a simple fact of life . \nYou watch for them like you would dangerous animals  , or poisonous spiders and snakes when out in the wilderness . \nThe wilderness is actually safer , and I spend a good bit of time out there . \n\nI've had tools and things stolen out of the back of my truck , and my house broken into . \n\nYou have to lock everything , all the time . \nI can't imagine living somewhere so urbane . \nTo us it seems careless . \n\nAnd no , you don't get to reserve a seat before you order . \nYou order , then find a place to sit , if alone . \nIf you are with someone , they hold a spot , with your gear , while you order for everyone . \nEven then , you watch out for each other . \n\nTrouble can start at any moment when you are out in public . \nYou have to be ready to grab your gear , and fight your way to safety , at any time . \nCertain groups thrive on causing trouble , it's entertainment for them . \nYour gear becomes their gear , if you lay it down , or they can take it from you ."	
12687,"I kinda want to live in japan just for this... But I hate winter."	
12688,"I piss on the spot i want...my dog taught me that trick"	
12689,"Lmao this is what we do in our school (though it's kind of dangerous to do this outside the school)"	
12690,"In Singapore we leave a packet of tissue on the table. Anything else will probably be stolen or deemed as forgotten items."	
12691,"The lesson here folks is by all means, leave your valuables to save your spot in Japan. In fact, the more valuable, the better. That's why I always leave my kids to save mine. \nLOL"	
12692,"This is why I love the idea of moving to Japan. It is the antithesis of where I live, quite genuinely and I need to be in that kind of environment after all these years."	
12693,"life would be complicated for the foodicted like me but love For Japan for their simplicity."	
12694,"I do the same here in UAE, never had an issue but I think its a bad habit"	
12695,"I'm  sorry  but I think  saving  spots is rude on it self and unfair to others, unless a person is wanting  there I'd be ok with it."	
12696,"I'm natives american. From Minnesota. On our tribe you will find many tight knit families and close friends. Recent economic growth has led to entire streets of house's being reserved for one family with a common name. We are close knit. At event's the best seats are reserved for the elderly and accomplished. Besides that we share so well nobody would hold a thought that was stingy or aggressive. It's more about the activity.:)"	
12697,"In South Africa, don't leave anything anywhere, it will be  gone in 5minutes. Also saving a spot is heavily frowned upon."	
12698,"I'd rob them"	
12699,"That last line xD	
12701,"How do you save your spot where you're from? ROFL!"	
12702,"Probably because Japan has a 95% conviction rate and harsh environments in prison."	
12703,"In the US if you leave your stuff it gets stolen or someone argues with you saying you cant save seats like that or will probably push your stuff off the table. Lol"	
12704,"we do it in turkey too :)"	
12705,"in NYC, there would have been 10 cops with the bomb squad. we don't mess with unattended bags haha"	
12706,"Beware if you see a small pack of tissue in Singapore food court table."	
12707,"Usually when I'm with friends or family whomever gets their drink first is tasked with finding a spot for the group. Not sure if ordering is the same elsewhere, but once everyone has a drink we sit and wait for the food."	
12708,"I also do that here in our country Philippines but I make sure that i only leave a less valuable thing in the table and look whose nearby my seat so if anything happens or if my things got stolen i know who to blame 😂😂😂"	
12709,"Unfortunately, I think the video is sending a wrong message. Although Japan is considered to be generally safe, thieves do exist and I know people who had their bikes stolen multiple times. So no matter how safe a place are, it's your own responsibilities to take care of your valuables."	
12710,"Here in the USA......it would be gone .....even if you turn your head!    But in church ......no I can safely hold my seat with my jacket!"	
12711,"Only Tokyo in Japan. Other cities in Japan are more relaxing."	
12712,"In america you dont"	
12713,"We do this in the Philippines... but before you know it, it's gone. lol\nSo yeah... Japan... you seriously have the most disciplined people in the World. TBH"	
12714,"I once saw a lone WALLET save a seat at a restaurant in McDonalds. Really? The literal EASIEST thing to steal and you choose it?"	
12715,"We leave a bag or something ...I'm sure a smartphone or a laptop would be snatched up rather quickly"	
12716,"Unfortunately since 9/11 if u leave bags around unattended for a while in Australia they may get reported to security or police because of bomb threats. Not that we have much of a problem in Australia with terrorists. \nI wouldn't leave my valuables to save a seat, better to b safe than sorry!"	
12717,"Love the girls shirt at 4:00"	
12718,"In America you would never leave anything valuable unattended. It would get stolen in minutes. You would put your soda and napkins in the table. I love your video's. They are very informative."	
12719,"Lol. We also do that in the Philippines"	
12720,"In Portugal, if you're with friends, someone sits at the table while others get food. If you're alone though, you're out of luck."	
12721,"I got four minutes of my life stolen by watching this video, maybe the next video could be on Japanese immigration policy?"	
12722,"In Poland you'd have to leave behind a person, preferably someone difficult to move."	
12723,"Well.when I try to save my spot at school people move my stuff😾😾😾😾"	
12724,"that's why i always leave my kids to save mine LOL"	
12725,"I noticed a lot of Japanese men are wearing Fanny packs these days. Just not around their belt, but like a mini, one strap backpack"	
12726,"It's the same in Singapore! They call it 'chope'. However if you do it in Indonesia, your stuff will magically gone in a few seconds lol"	
12727,"Warning: Dont try this in New York"	
12728,"How does someone forget to ride there bike home?  Is it just me or is that weird?"	
12729,"My parents will either leave me and my sisters or our coats.  Sometimes I have to take off my shoes just save seats :/"	
12730,"by leaving your friend alone on the spot"	
12731,"We sit on the spot to save it in Bangladesh😛😛😛😝😝😝"	
12732,"In the USA if you leave your stuff anywhere be prepared it will be taken that is unless someone so kind with a good heart will return it to where someone can retrieve it easily. One day I was at a mall where I left my bag with two items I bought and thinking someone would return it to lost and found but apparently it was take so I had to rebuy. What I do is when I am alone I don't ever save seats because its pointless however if I am with someone then I have that person save us a seat while I take orders for both of us if its take out or if its order in than me and the person I am with whether it is with my hubby friend or family will take turns to use restroom."	
12733,"There is no such thing as, saving your spot in Los Angeles XD So sad"	
12734,"Just because you can have faith in a chair doesn't mean you should jump up and down on it.\nCAN you use your wallet to save your space? Probably. Should you? No.\nEven if the Japanese were 100% trustworthy- and they are not, there are millions of foreign tourists there every year. Just because Japan is extremely safe doesn't mean it is 100% safe.\nLiving there for years, I became aware of some incidents of theft. However, I will always say that Japan is a great place to travel solo, as crime is extremely minimal. You can use backpacks or bags behind you without any real fear if being ripped off. You don't have to worry about someone rummaging in your bags while you get your wallet to pay. If you ask someone for directions, or look at a map, or otherwise be distracted, you are extremely unlikely to be taken advantage of. But you're still not 100% safe. Don't tempt fate."	
12735,"Holy cow. \n#41 on trending. \nWay to go Greg."	
12736,"What a blessing it is that you live in such a safe place!!!! I could never save a seat with my belongings. :( A great eye opening vid. Keep it coming!!!"	
12737,"So basically what you're saying is Japan is the best country to steal stuff"	
12738,"Some people in my country use their car keys"	
12739,"We save spot in America with our NON valuables.... lol"	
12740,"We do the same thing in Canada. I live on the east coast."	
12741,"Did you actually recorded dog poo? 3:08"	
12742,"In korea and japan, you can leave your wallet, purse, or cellphone on the side walk and no one will even touch it.\nThen, they go to US and get robbed at gun point."	
12743,"I move   the stuff and put it on another table. If people are not there then too bad. You lose the spot. One of the things I find really irritating about Japan."	
12744,"You take the whole chair where im from"	
12745,"3:17 That scene transition looked like your daughter was your wife... lol."	
12746,"Try to do it in the U.S and I guarantee when you come back your things aren't gonna be there"	
12747,"We leave a person in London, UK everything would be stolen."	
12748,"I've often noticed how similarly priced Japan is compared to the Netherlands. Price to get your bike from a bicycle depository after the municipality had it removed? €22.50 or ¥2 925.60 at the current exchange rates :o\n\nIt's not just leaving stuff behind to save seats, you can safely leave your stuff unattended for a while. When I arrived in Japan my friend and I went to the shopping centre under Tokyo Station and because there was so little space in the shops themselves, we left our bags near the entrance as much out of the way as we could so we wouldn't be a bother to other people while browsing."	
12749,"So Japan is so safe, police have enough time to just sit there and spy on a bait?"	
12750,"If you are a thief do not watch this video please."	
12751,"i left my janky old non-fuctional skateboard at a gym for 10 minutes and some took it.....(us)"	
12752,"lol if you leave your bag at your table in Jerusalem the bomb squad will blow it up with a robot"	
12753,"Wait, why am I watching this? I can't afford going to Japan."	
12754,"I accidentally left my hat on a train station. I have to ride back to the said station to get it at station office. Speaking little Japanese, good thing I've got a selfie of me with the said hat on my phone, making of retrieving it easier. Everyone at the station are so helpful and kind.:)"	
12755,"I went shopping in kyoto and left my video camera and gimbal at checkout.  It was 20 mins later that i realised it was missing and rushed back to find it still sitting there.\n\nI love japan!!"	
12756,"Japan have the lowest crime of all cities in the world"	
12757,"This happens in my school's library"	
12758,"Do any of your kids see hachisakama plz I am so srry if they get scared Google it"	
12759,"Japanese tourists even do this in Hawaii. I saw this in a Waikiki food court, so I did it too. Mainland there is no way I would leave valuables at a table. Sometimes in a smaller place like a Starbucks, I will leave a jacket."	
12760,"*i would switch different left items so that when owners come back they will struggle to find them and will think twice about leaving them there the next time*"	
12761,"Nice shirt"	
12762,"With packs of tissue wipes. 😂"	
12763,"この動画とコメント欄から、日本人が得られる教訓＝外人を見たらドロボウと思え。"

12770,"Congrats on trending! 💗"	
12771,"Haha those turds thoooo 💩💩"	
12772,"泥棒が日本に来るからやめてくれ"	
12773,"In USA you go with more then one person. One person sits and saves the spot while other gets food, goes to restroom or whatever. If you are by yourself....you don't save your spot. When you get up you lose it."	
12774,"The lesson here is: move to japan. The way to save your spot or your belongings in London is eating at home."	
12775,"poor Aiko."	
12776,"next video: food you can make while driving"	
12777,"I didn't tap on any YouTuber's who had anything to say about the hurricane I'm living through I felt most was just hopping on what was trending! But I said self not him self said hummmmm so I tapped on YOU! Thank you you really care!"	
12778,"In the next video: How to watch youtube videos with no power."	
12779,"So many catchphrases😂"	
12780,"Could have torched the cheese on the pizza. But a lot of those things need refrigeration like mayo, cheese and butter and most stores do not have even those foods once the storm hits.........no electricity."

12791,"This video reminds me of my friend Thomas and our drunken college days. He would raid my cabinet and make a delicious meal with the random ingredients I had on hand."	
12792,"and congrats to your bro on the wedding!"	
12793,"I had a hard time understanding how you'd be unable to cook without power. Then it hit me, electric powered stoves. I've always used gas fueled stoves my whole life so even when storms cut off power, i can still cook."	
12794,"Thanks bros!"	
12795,"we need camera,.thumbs down"	
12796,"Great advice"	
12797,"you're awesome dude!!!! <3 God bless you"	
12798,"Don't suggest the Mayo. If they don't have power then the last thing you want is spoiled mayo that hasn't been refrigerated or the power had been out for a few days.  J/s"	
12799,"I have a silly question. How will they watch the video with no power?"	
12800,"Sometimes I watch these videos and wonder if the target audience is high, and other times I find myself asking how I never thought of that"	
12801,"How is someone in Cali meant to see this lol do they just have wifi hotspots set up in the eye of the storm along with free wireless charging"

12804,"Awesome video. Thank you!"	
12805,"The second repice is very similar to that one which i learned from my uncle. You're cooking a pasta then when it's ready add some cane fish and some other things u have in the fridge like vegetables, mustard, ketchup if u like and u can eat it warm or just put it in a fridge and eat it later.\nBe safe and have a good one guys!"	
12806,"God bless you! tip: umeboshi was widely used in old Japan in bento boxes to make the food last longer, so day one cooked protein and more will last you up to 20 hrs if you put several umeboshi in a box with it"	
12807,"How are they supposed to watch this if they don't have power?"	
12808,"just the other day some guy in an alley came up to me and told me I had to try these sardines. Then he reached into his pants so I walked away"	
12809,"For mayo/ miracle whip/salad dressing Dollar Tree makes little jars. You could either buy before storms or buy & occasionally use them bc they have a couple of months self life. I think this video was an awesome way of showing support!"	
12810,"i love how the background and his dressing is so appropriate for the theme of this video #attentiontodetail"	
12811,"Did they both move out of New York?"	
12812,"I wanted to say thank you for this vid, from the bottom of my heart. Sent to Mom in FL. She thanks you as well ☺️"	
12813,"Pause and be grateful because I have something 100% accurate! Love your videos. I've been without power for almost 20 hours and I really appreciate this video!"	
12814,"Rofl. He moves his body as much as a rapper. Looks like he's dancing. Watch from 0:16 and for like 10 seconds. xD!"

12818,"Things you can do in your car in traffic: pulls out a blowtorch."	
12819,"It's not meant to be fancy food. The food may look awkward, but it's not about how the food looks, it's about using your mind and what you have and use the best of it. In a bad situation people need to come together and try to comfort each other in the best way possible, ever if you make a meal with whatever you have. This guy has a good heart and good intentions"	
12820,"Awesome stuff but man we will not be crazy like that in the event of a hurricane"	
12821,"was that a bobo bar in the oatmeal alternative?"	
12822,"This guy is hungry😂"	
12823,"Thank you so much for this video! I looked on google the last few day and couldn't find anything this concise. I'm in Gainesville so the severity of Irma and how long we will be without power is unknown. We are about to get the worst in the next few hours and it's so nice to have some yummy recipes to look forward to that we can make without power."

12828,"I had to pause your video to make the tuna dip and it's REALLY good. I would never have thought to add what you added, nor would I have thought to eat it with tortilla chips. \nThis is why I love you guys!! New AMAZING ideas."	
12829,"Food is definitely comforting. We had a fire that destroyed my kitchen and left toxic smoke everywhere and had to evacuate. Fortunately my insurance paid for a hotel. We got a suite with a teeny kitchen. My mother in law was with us and we went to a store to get supplies. We all went off in different directions and got stuff and we ALL came back with baskets filled with comfort food. Mac n Cheese, White bread, peanut butter puddings etc. It helped us through the first few awful days."	
12830,"Cooking implies heat is involved. Instead you prepared a piece of bread with debris on it."	
12831,"if there is no power now hiw the hell they will see this video😒"

12862,"Would you do a video showing the alternative cooking products. You rushed through and only used the one. Where I live, we are more likely to lose power due to snow. Being able to heat up some soup, or hot drinks can make a big difference in keeping you warm. However, this video had a lot of great tips of things to have that don't to be kept cool. I need to grab some of the small almond milks for our storm supplies stash.  Thanks again for a wonderful video and helping us to thinking outside the box."

12866,"Hey. I used to live in St.Martin and have loads of friends who survived  Irma. Trust me they don't need to cook there these days. Food is not what they worry about most. These people are not stupid. There are so many easily available kinds of food that don't need cooking or power to prepare. You Americans can only microwave stuff so you die without power."	
12867,"did he say he moved to Denver???"

12871,"I have a good tuna salad & some other ideas... I am just hoping this helps someone. I'm sure there's a TON of people on here who have family in FL, I know I do. My tuna salad goes great on any kind of cracker, bread, in a tomato, lettuce, or wrap. Especially for people trying to stretch a meal while packing in a lot of vitamins or just use up veggies. The majority of these things will last out of the fridge and even though there is quite a bit of prep, it's totally worth it. You can even just throw all of it on a sandwich in a pinch and get the same flavor. \n\nI came up with this about a year ago when my husband and I were down on our luck and I was trying to pack a bunch of nutrition, & bulk into an affordable meal.\n\nAnyways, I normally use 2-3 cans of tuna, if you only have 1 can, just use that! I've done it before, and it still worked perfectly. My cats usually get part of the can. It's also another way to feed your pets if you need to. Lol So I hit the drained tuna immediately with the juice of 1 lemon. If you don't have lemon, use red wine or some other kind of vinegar. Then add 1/2 - 1Chopped red onion, 1 chopped green bell pepper, 1 seeded chopped tomato or a handful of cherry/grape tomatoes, both sweet & kosher dill pickles chopped, or relish, S&P everything and add a touch of mayo. You could even omit the Mayo if you wanted. The veggies and the lemon juice add enough moisture which cuts back on the amount of mayo needed. The acid from the lemon cuts through the fishyness as well. I have also added celery to this and have topped it with provolone. Could be a great vegg friendly item for people who don't like to eat tuna.\n\nAnother great idea with tuna and or leftover pasta. You can always make tuna salad for 1 day or meal, then make a pasta salad the next. If you cooked a couple days prior to your power being knocked out, it's possible that you already have cooked pasta. If you have frozen peas, add those in with a simple tuna salad made with something along the lines of tuna, lemon juice and zest or vinegar, red onion, and dill weed, or dill pickles. It's another way to stretch something you've already made or use up something you have already. \nThis pasta salad can go so many different directions. You could do a Greek or Italian style, cold/room temp pasta salad with different cheeses, deli meats and veggies. Adding things like spinach to bulk it up. If you add cheese, you should eat it asap obviously.\nYou could even do a veggie wrap with peanut sauce..."

12873,"I have been so stressed about losing power and had a hard time finding how we would eat if we do. Of course we have canned foods and bread but I didn't know how to make full meals with what we have. Thank you for this video and your thoughtfulness. Much love from Florida."	
12874,"People need to understand thy even after the hurricane has passed ppl might be without power for a while ... the way it looks is the last thing ppl will care about .. nutrition, nourishment is most important. These are easy recipes.. that ppl can make. Good video"

12888,"It's interesting that you brought that up Hank, because that's pretty much exactly what's been in my head upon meeting you on Sunday.  I'm not sure that you remember me, but I was the Asian girl in the red beanie, the blue hair, I had a face full of makeup, puffy jumper and healed boots. Now already, I can feel the judgement/ analysis of the type of person you (the reader) think that I am... And that's okay, because it's human nature. It protects you from imminent danger and whatnot. The way I presented myself that day is not exactly what you would call the 'typical nerdfighter' image. It makes me wonder how different your perception of me would have been if I had my glasses on, I'd worn a hoody, and I'd come up to you barefaced (and here I am stereotyping the typical geek or nerd -.- see we all do it). Don't get me wrong Hank, you were lovely, but when you looked at me for the first time it was a look of suprise almost. Idk maybe that's just how I read it. It suddenly kicked in that you had no idea who I was, yet I knew so much about you (your personality, your likes and dislikes, your hobbies, your intellect, your status etc etc) and I can only imagine how hard it would be to be meeting all these strangers, hundreds in a row, and being nice to them and trying to make them feel welcome. I realised that your perception of me would be purely based upon this 60 second time frame. (In which those 60 seconds I freaked out, ran up and hugged you, acted like a complete fangirl and said exactly the things I had decided not to say to u when waiting in the line haha). But I feel as if we have this programming inside our minds that automatically works to act a certain way towards people depending on the type of person we perceive them to be or by how safe we feel in their presence. Its not a bad thing. It's just human nature and it protects us. But man, on the other hand, this is exactly the reason why some people are so self conscious and so insecure about what they look like (I know I definitely struggle with that on the regular.. Because I WANT to dress how I want, i want to be able to have fun with what I wear and make up my face so that if u made a collage of my face each day, it would be like a fluid mosaic) We can't stop the judgement, because it is innate, but we can go into meeting a new person with an open mind. I just think its an interesting topic...but I mean, socialising is harddd. Probability of u reading this: probably zero. But worth a shot anyway :)"

12896,"Hank, I really loved that quiet feet-in-grass moment at the end there. There are too few moments that I stop and appreciate such quiet, subtle joys, and even fewer of those when the joy belongs to somebody else. So thank you for the moment, it made me feel."	
12897,"Aww, you are making me miss my home town!  Have a great time in Melbourne!!"

12914,"Hank, how great is Australia!? I'll let you in on an Australian secret, the best-est and most great-est place in Australia, objectively, is the Northern Territory. AND if you ever felt the urge to visit the prettiest and least populated part of Australia, I know a born and raised territorian who just happens to be an enthusiastic nerdfirghter who would give you a tour for a very speacial price ($0.00!)

12963,"My annual summer marathon of Vlogbrother videos once again comes to an end...in September. Yeah, there's a lot of these now. \n\nStill good though! Although there's a lot of death in the later years, I must say. I mean, the videos are also much, MUCH more positive and optimistic overall and about the future as we go along but there's also a lot more discussion on mortality and growing older, as well as actual death (both good news, like how less people are dying now which is great and also the many horrible ways in which living things are dying...and Lemon).\n\nI think the channel is still great and perhaps more importantly, still greatly loved. The Green Brothers may be older, John may be greyer and Hank may have a sexy haircut now but it seems like they are happier and better people than they were at the start of the project and so too are we. \n\nI feel like Nerdfighteria needs a poem, like the Sherlock Fandom does, to encapsulate the wonder of it all, y'know? 221B is a great poem for the latter series and fandom. We need one too."

13101,"Well if there is 14 watermelons in the pyramid, you need to realize that they are 75% water, so, given that information, we can use the circumference of each melon (which is about 34 inches) to calculate the volume of each melon. 75% of that is water, and 25% is less dense fruit. Now, our calculations may vary based on formulas, but once you get the weight of one melon you should be home free. All you have to do now is multiply what you got by 14 and you get the total weight of the watermelon pyramid. Pls read on to compare your results with mine.\n\nMy estimates put the TOTAL weight of the watermelons at about 6 trillion pounds plus or minus a few."	
13102,"This series of videos is full on awesome!  3 cheers for the guys hauling they anvils up the tower, your hard work makes magic happen.\n\nI still think anvil and/or bowling ball versus line-x melons and eggs is the way to go for the next level of gravity-powered excitement."

I haven't listened to country music since the 90s when country sound was full of Reba, Shania, Trisha, Patty Loveless, Garth, Pam Tillis,  Sammy Kershaw, Lorrie  Morgan, Tanya Tucker, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Brian White, Dwight Yoakum, Wade Hayes, Doug Stone, Collin Raye, Mark Chestnut Terri Clark and any more that I consider the golden age of true country music.  Now country sounds so blended with other genres of music that I would rather listen to classic country then to return to listening to modern country."

13580,"Sanders is ALL substance! Truly a model politician. Set him up for a joke, gossip, bickering	 and he brings it back to policy!"
13581,"Like a boss!"	
13582,"Bernie gorgeous being"	
13583,"Colbert hosted a dying show until Trump hate gave himself more time and money. Too bad he cant do something actually funny, productive or at least humane in an hour, rather than the nazi salute."	
13584,"Something nice about Trump: Everything he has tried to do (and will continue to do: including ending DACA) has ended up becoming a failure."	
13585,"Is it just me or is the audio REALLY tinny sounding on this?"	
13586,"How about saying something to the effect of thanks President Trump for withdrawing us from the disastrous TPP which I campaigned on myself. Or thanks President Trump for attempting to correct our trade deficits which is something I campaigned on myself. Cant't believe I ever supported this fraudulent sack."

13591,"I could care less about Colbert's political opinions, but its clear that he's milking his entire show now off of Trump and his presidency, and has been for months now. It's very unoriginal at this point. Matter of fact, I bet most celebrities don't even have any clue what they're even saying when speaking out against him: they probably only say it to get attention."	
13592,"The book : Bernie Sanders guide to political Karl Jewish Marxist revolution. ....yeah because the bolshevick revolution and the gulag archipelago by Alexander solzhenitzin needs to be repeated again!.....Ron Paul was way better. If he had been elected in 2012 we would still owe 13 trillion in debt instead of this 20 trillion that oblamo caused. Also we have 200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. Bernie is insane.....and I'm Mexican....Smh...😂"	
13593,"Sanders is lying in this interview, Trump scrapped the TPP which Sanders wanted to do as well. Also, Whoever the fuck was smashing his head on the piano in the last 5 seconds of this video needs to be fired"

13597,"Corpratists own America and the only hope right now lies in Bernie but there are all these crazy uneducated racists getting in the way. The people that really care about america are almost being drowned out by stupidty and ignorance fueled by the president."	
13598,"I will say something nice about Bernie.  He is better then Hillary.  But not by much."	
13599,"The way Bernie refused to attack Clinton in their debates, I wonder if he was in on the fix from day-1."	
13600,"I wanted to feel the Bernnnnn!!!!! Come back to us Bernie Sanders"	
13601,"I see a lot of hate in the comments for both parties, so I'm going to be really blunt here, both parties are massively corrupt and the only real difference between the Democratic and Republican parties is which specific industries purchased them.  Can't we all at least agree on that?"	
13602,"Raise minimum wage? I make 26 dollars an hour and bust my balls for every penny but McDonald's employees want 15 an hour so I can stand around for 22 minutes for a precooked burger fuck you!!!!!!"

13606,"Who left the door unlocked at the nut house, Bernie got out."	
13607,"I'm sorry Bernie but are attack helicopters covered by this medicare? Because if not I'm deeply offended and glad Clinton cheating and stole the candidacy to only lose to the easiest opponent."	
13608,"I love you, Larry David!"	
13609,"My list was \n1.)ben Carson\n2.) Donald Trump \n3.) Ted Cruz\n4.) Bernie Sanders\n5.)my own death\n6.) Hillary Clinton"

13618,"Islam is ful of bloodshed or have you not noticed stop maki no exxuses"	
13619,"lol... that awkward moment when the embodiment of hope in America points to you as a member of the filthy media obsessed with the drama instead of the important things in the world.\n\nColbert used to mean something and stood for issues, now he's no better than the very media he used to make fun of. \nJon Oliver is the only one still carrying the torch from the daily show. He informs the people, causes real world change even if its small, and is damn funny doing it.\nStephen Colbert is just covering garbage and making fun of trump. I don't usually use the term sold out but its the only thing that I think applies."	
13620,"The one that got away."	
13621,"I hope he runs again. I would vote for him😇"	
13622,"Healthcare is not a human right."	
13623,"He has good ideas but if he were real he would acknowledge the real problem in America and large swaths of the world is J$wish supremacy and their omnipotence. They are the banking and pharmaceutical giants exploiting America he talks about. And anyone with a brain knows that voting for this guy would mean controlled opposition and the anti-White bias going even more through the roof it broke through long ago. He wouldn't bite the hand that feeds him, his own tribe I you know that much. He would overtax working class and ultimately keep the ridiculous power imbalances the same or make them worse. The worst thing he would have done is open immigration as a genocidal divide and rule and Europeans as the eternal scapegoat. He would likely recruit directly from antifa and BLM for supreme court and other critical institutions. His own Black campaign Spokeswoman came on CNN and outrageously shouted a sarcastic boohoo poor White people at an old man getting dragged out of his car and beaten only for supposedly voting Trump. And then they are surprised these people DID vote for Trump and call them stupid for doing so. When Blacks attack White people in the streets 24/7 without the politicized, monopolized, J$w run anti-White media or politicians giving a crap rather jumping on any opportunity to brand White people racist and persecute them as if responsible for all that strife."	
13624,"I would love to see nationalized health care for all. However, what a lot of people may not realize is if nationalized health care went through everyone's taxes would sky rocket. Additionally, for those who are healthy and take care of their health through wise choices who don't need to see doctors their wages would be garnished tremendously for a service they would not even see. I used to live in Canada and let me tell you while we did have nationalized health all the rich left the country because of the stupid high taxes and it left the middle class picking up the poor. It doesn't work as well as you think it would unfortunately."

13627,"I like Hillary, but I can't understand how she blames everyone and everything but herself. you ran a crappy campaign!!!!!!!!!!!!"	
13628,"Bernie is a cuck that committed bank fraud. it'd be more interesting to see if Trump could think of anything Bernie has done that doesn't involve breaking the law or getting cucked. At least he'd be respectful and actually mean what he says 100%."	
13629,"Fuck You dictator Trump!! 2020 the year's of Bernie!!"	
13630,"He has nothing 'nice' to say, although I dont really believe that is anyone's focus. He continues to disparage Hillary while cloaking it in treacle. So glad he is relegated to a minor position now."	
13631,"How does it feel to be Trojan horsed by Bernie for Hilary votes???"	
13632,"Donated 1 mill of his own money to hurricane Harvey victims. Beat the entire political establishment with his first real bid for office. Oh, but he used the words Mexican and rapists in the same sentence, so I guess none of that matters. Also created 1 mill jobs, gave up his salary-but what's this? He used the word pussy 12 years ago? Clearly an irredeemable human being"	
13633,"Ah, two millionaires complaining about another millionaire and a billionaire. Interesting times."	
13634,"When people get old, do their necks just completely disappear?"	
13635,"I dont understand why he doenst just start his own party, then all the progrssives can join and get rit of the 2 party system. This way you have a real alternative."

13643,"...says the guy who built his campaign railing against Wall St. and the monied interests and then after being screwed over by \nHillary  (the wall street candidate who made hundreds of millions by selling out) quite docilely bends over and plants his lips firmly on her backside, giving her his endorsement.  And we are supposed to take him seriously?"	
13644,"Please fix America, we need help!!"	
13645,"please run again Bernie and save this nation from trump destruction !!"	
13646,"Does the Late Show pay for this spot on YouTube or do they advertised for free ?"	
13647,"You would think Bernie would have more sympathy for Trump, since both of them have been railroaded by the Democrats.  The DNC conspired to prevent him from winning the Democratic nomination, just like the Democrats in Congress have conspired to prevent Trump from enacting a single policy during his presidency in a successful attempt to convince idiotic liberals that he is a bumbling moron."	
13648,"Bernie Sanders is like that old crazy creepy uncle at Thanksgiving that is senile as fuck and just ends up sneezing in the mash potatoes and falling asleep in the chair"

13661,"Help me"	
13662,"Both Him & Colbert are total KIKES. Bernie never had a full time job, he ran for a political platform that would take care of a loser like him, & after selling out to Hillary he fully rooted for her. So he's no different. Fuck that socialist KIKE & all of his supporters. & isn't his wife under FBI investigation?"	
13663,"Love you Bernie!  Keep spreading your light & your truth! I'm a Canadian and enjoy free health care, and couldn't imagine it any other way! In fact, it's one of the reasons that some of Canadians I know will never move to the states. Free healthcare is not a socialist concept, it's a human right. I hope that more Bernies will be born from his leadership!! Sending my love to all my American friends :)"	
13664,"I feel like just explaining to Trump that health care should be a basic human right would be too much for him. As soon as he hears free health care, he'd make up his mind and stop listening."	
13665,"I used to like Bernie Sanders, but he sold out and got run down by Hillary.\n\nNow there's Trump....\n\nThere's some pros and cons about Trump, but I'll give him a chance regardless.\n\nAmerica needs a business man not a politician."	
13666,"I wasn't scared of the new movie IT cause he look like Bernie Sanders"	
13667,"Why isn't this man our president again?"

13674,"i dont get it why the USA is still not having healthcare for all\nits not lke the USA can not afford it\ni mean, come on\nits not to hard and it pays off\nit creates jobs, it makes people healthier\nwe have a system (i am from Belgium btw) where everyone over the age of 18 pays 70€ ($72) every year for the basic healthcare\nour doctor visits and hospital bills get paid for the biggest part by our healthcare (we pay €1-€4 per doctors visit), plus when we get sick our salary is paid by our healthcare to\nif we need more insurance then we are free to take an extra insurance\ni pay around 15€ per month for a 100% coverage including private room when i get in the hospital, even when you need expensive artificial replacements like a new hand, new knee...\nand to think we are not even a rich country, even we can afford it"

13899,": : I have an allergic reaction to anti-depressants so in order to sleep well I take gabapetin (seizure medicine) which doesn't effect hormone/chemical levels but more neurons to sleep well at night and reduce anxiety.

Hopefully after the year you won't need zanex anymore anyway. Remember to get your support systems going for when you're feeling down. I'm so glad to see you getting better all the time and figuring things out with a great attitude. 	)\nThe only time I ever felt like I was going slow was when I had a high fever as a child and I was delirious too. It was an awfully strange feeling and very scary."
13910,"Hey girl glad you're back to normal and your speech sounds great!!! Glad you got things sorted out! Xanax is super strong and does crazy things to a lot of people so don't feel bad! xo"	
13911,"Your speech is amazing in this video❤️it's come on so much and you speak so quickly it's so brilliant to hear!! If you're still feeling anxious maybe you could trying practicing CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) obviously just a suggestion and I definitely haven't gone through anything as traumatic as you but it has really helped me feel better and get my anxiety under control❤️"	
13912,"Hey just found your channel. Much respect for sharing your story. I wanted to extend myself as an outlet to answer any questions you may have about other people in similar situations being helped by medical grade tinctures derived from the cannabis plant. Sending positive vibes and a big hug! Keep fighting."	
13913,"Good luck to you.  It's a shame Xanax didn't work for you, but good you figured it out so quickly.  As you said, everyone handles meds differently.  I was on anxiety meds throughout chemo and found them helpful, but I guess I was lucky that the particular med I took didn't interact with the particular kind of chemo I received.\n\nI can't believe the jerks saying not to take chemo, or that whatever snake oil they read about on Facebook would cure cancer.  Nobody without an MD has any business telling someone how to treat their cancer."

Exercise , yoga and you still need light amount of sun , look into tinctures herbal to detox , juicing and raw fruit and veggie diet and you will beat this in a month or two believe these words I speak they are poisoning you and do not continue if you wish to live , this advice is with love , if you love to live quit the chemo on all levels it's not your fault they have tricked and manipulated the population it's a money making , that's it all it is they have killed my family members and dine my research and saved others , look Up DR.ROBERT MORSE ON YOU TUBE HE WILL SAVE YOU YOUR DREAMS ARE TELLING YOU WHAT YOU FEEL INSIDE IS NOT RIGHT GOD BLESS YOU AND PLEASE HEADE THIS WARNING AND THIS ADVICE IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE , PEACE AND LOVE TO YOU PLEASE GOD SAID TO TELL YOU THAT THING YOU KEEP THINKING ABOUT ,THAT IS BOTHERING YOU , YOU ARE RIGHT COME ALIVE AND BELIEVE IN YOURSELF NOT YOU AND CHEMO CHEMO IS EVIL ,GOOD LUCK YOU HAVE A NEW  PLAN NOW START  NOW  PLEASE .....!!!!!!!"	
13972,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT DO CHEMO OR RADIATION THE DOCTORS ARE WHAT THEY FIRST SUGGEST WHEN YOU HAVE CANCER WHEN THEY KNOW THE FRICKING TRUTH THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IS THE SOLUTION WHEN THE SOLUTION IS THAT CANCER IS NOT AS BAD AS WE THINK WE CAN GET RID OF IT NATURALLY BY JUST CHANGING YOUR DIET ONLY VEGGIES AND FRUIT AND NOO MEAT AT ALL THATS IT I HOPE YOU READ MY COMMENT GOD BLESS YOU ."	
13973,"chemo is mustard gas and was created by the Nazi's.  It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube."	
13974,"I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden."

14427,"Looks good Netflix. This means season two won't drop until 2021"	
14428,"I've read the book, its interesting but nowhere near as action packed and epic as the trailer. They kinda went full action movie to sell it to the crowds."

14435,"when can we see it?"	
14436,"Lol looks like netflix realized the mistake they made by rejecting handmaids tale, so they probably bought out rights to every margaret atwood books now."	
14437,"(Christ answers Judas.

14470,"so the competition begins with Disney..."	
14471,"Obviously Margaret Atwood likes to focus on class and societal structures, the divide between the wealthy and the servants etc. Not sure how people are struggling to understand that concept. As for the choice of music in the trailer, I think it works. Some people just have a lack of imagination 😘"

They join forces with a militant African-Chinese non-observant Jewish interior decorator 'Maurice' and travel Canada, distributing hypodermic needles & condoms to those in need."	
14488,"Trailer should've ended at 1:20. Netflix, you're trailers are waaaaay too long"

14494,"? You can't date me, that's the only advice I have.?"	
14495,"yassss, I like it.I love you now ❤️"	
14496,"I've had enough of females playing mind games, they're mostly sociopaths."

14498,"You can't be yourself if you haven't established to yourself, who you are, so. Who are you?"	
14499,"lol in the shower all naked and stuff"	
14500,"I mean I'm 14 so I definitely know everything about boys..."	
14501,"...another self professed know it all who thanks to easy access to social media can annoy and irritate way more people than her tiny circle of friends..."	
14502,"what if being yourself results in a guarantee you will not properly romantically connect with a person? i think 'be yourself' is terrible dating advice and needs more to go off. you need to change yourself and find yourself within that change. my bluntness will always be my downfall in dating, but i'm working on understanding how i should speak what i feel or think.\nside note, you're the prettiest person i've ever seen. you look like god shat you out personally from his asshole"	
14503,"I think the fear most people have, though they might never realize it, is What if I am myself and no one falls in love with me then...?"	
14504,"It's funny that you'd post this as well as peomoting Matt Husey. 🤔"	
14505,"Did she have surgery? If so, for someone who's very transparent, I thought she might mention her breast implants? I guess it's none of my business."	
14506,"Instead of being yourself, I like the idea of striving to become a better version of yourself everyday. I struggle to love and accept myself. So what I had to do was think about all the important people in my life.  I realized I want what's best for them.  If I want whats best for them, that means I should want what is best for myself because they want what is best for me.  Wanting what is best for myself = self love.  If someone is at the point where they haven't fully explored who they are, why wouldn't they want to hide who they are and compensate by following some strict guidelines to human interaction.  If someone takes on this kind of responsibility the self acceptance will come much more naturally."	
14507,"Guys, only one thing works. Doesn't matter if your're old, fat or ugly. Money. have tons of it and the girls will break your door down. Boom. Problem solved. Myth confirmed."	
14508,"The only dating advice...? So you haven't wondered why you fall for the wrong guys? And why you don't like the guys you should? \n\nI'm completely with you on finding someone that you connect with, but there's a bit more to it than that. If you want to understand why you choose the guys you do and how to find the right guy let me know. I bet I can do better than Matthew 	)\n\nOh yeah, and love your videos. Very funny. Great animation. Great style. Keep it up!"
14509,"Hey!  When will you be getting more sizes in the ghost and starts appeal??"	
14510,"Your sponsors are the only ones I don't skip, it's presented so nicely."	
14511,"You ever see the movie Hercules? Where he was so over powered that nobody wanted to play with him? I'm trapped, in human form."	
14512,"Anna. You need to tell us where you get you're awesome outfits you wear in these videos."	
14513,"Yeah then you keep being yourself, they fall in love with You, then all the sudden they say they don't love you anymore because of who you are. Maybe that means they never really loved you in the first place. Which is fucked up and horrible."	
14514,"Just Be Yourself is the Best and Worst advice at the same time. \n\nIts the best because it boosts your ego and helps you sleep better at night.\n\nIts the worst because you dont find a partner you actually want. You may find someone eventually, but it will feel like you settled. \n\nThe dating game is something your not entirely forced to play. But it is necessary if your standards are little more than just like me back."	
14515,"Very much agree Anna. You don't need to pretend to be someone in front of your date. He/she should like/love you for who you are."	
14516,"This would be applicable to me if dating was replaced with friendship"	
14517,"I tend to think Anna is right here but what about the abusers hiding behind people with fake reputations and lies that are designed to hurt people in the most unidentifiable way going.  Sneaky liars and deceivers.\n\nYou can try being yourself but if when you do others want to get back at you as they see that you're progressing somewhere and they hate it, they hate intensely.  They move to more covert methods and hide in groups.\n\nWhat then Anna?  How do you go against the masses that are designing your future around you and you don't know that they are destroying your life?\n\nWhy do they do it, I know that it is to hurt individuals they are scared of and others that they don't want around them anymore.  Money is a motivator and power is another but there are plenty of others also.\n\nThey picked off old families in posh expensive schools. rich in old lives, rich in the pre-adolescence and plenty of others.  They drive them mad in other ways in a end effort to make them strike there pain in some bloody way, can you register the blood baths at schools here?  Do you see now why you might be having dreams of death, there is a negative power working around you Anna.  Thankfully, you have a lot going for you and your offsetting it.  Am I wrong I do wonder all the time about this, do I see the signs or not?People do not see these types as they come across credible and have power, or neither.Where does being yourself go then?"	
14518,"What's up chicken butt? I don't know you but I love you, Anna."	
14519,"So do you agree with Matthew hussey or nah"	
14520,"That is very bad advice if you happen to be a lazy, fat, dirty slob. If you don't make an effort, you deserve what you get."	
14521,"This is why im still single"	
14522,"Anna, in a non perverted way, and more so in a, Hey, I noticed that kind of way, the rainbow colored shirt you're wearing does a really good job of showcasing your breasts. Way to go."	
14523,"Thanks Anna! Keep up the good work! :)"	
14524,"i love the self call-out at 0:35 lol"	
14525,"damn girl your views are going down"	
14526,"Don't date a worthless liberal don't date a college student don't date someone with a nose ring don't date someone with tattoos specialy a woman YUKE."	
14527,"Anna K would you ever date an Australian man"	
14528,"This would be really great advice if you explain how one is to be themselves when we've spent our entire lives hiding who we really are from strangers."	
14529,"I don't know how to be other people. Also I am married. :D"	
14530,"Ironic that Anna is talking about falling in love based on who people really are and to just be yourself, but that clearly must not have been good enough for someone or she wouldn't have felt the need or desire for the boob job. That's not a judgement, she can do as wants as it is her body, but the message and the actions are not consistent with eachother."	
14531,"Being asexual, why am I watching this? At midnight?"	
14532,"Great advice, I think, the only problem is I've pretended to be so many different people I don't know who I am anymore."	
14533,"Dam I clicked this accidentally and now I'ma prob gonna like make up tutorials and garbage like that"	
14534,"Tip #1 don't date this head case."	
14535,"Best dating advice: Be yourself*\n\n*and don't be an asshole"	
14536,"I don't date, im ugly , i dont have a single chance, im probably gonna suicide"	
14537,"Or they'll like you for your boobs. Boobs are awesome. I like boobs. I am a boob."	
14538,"What if I just want to have sex with a woman and have absolutely zero interest in hearing about her vapid, uninteresting life?"	
14539,"the only advice I can give you is stay away from American women I married a Ukrainian lady best move I ever made. I provide for her she takes care of me. plus she's a very hard worker and helps me with all the chores inside and outside all with a smile"	
14540,"Would follow this advice, but I don't really know (or remember) how my true self is. lolol."	
14541,"Her dad was my sub at victor valley high school on Friday"	
14542,"I got the only dating advice you'll ever need.....date a clown...BOOM. You're Welcome."	
14543,"Well there's phycology behind some of those dating tips"

14561,"I agree with her. If all you put out there is a false representation of yourself, all you're gonna get is people who are drawn to that fake person. But if you be yourself, you know you're getting true friends/relationships because they're attracted to you for being you."

14572,"I mean if I show women my actual personality they just think I'm super weird and don't like me. So I pretty much have to hide and put up a farce."	
14573,"Even I have come to realize myself if kinda depressing. Of course being in a state of depression doesn't help but trying to find the light in every tunnel makes it seem darker for every wrong turn I make. Also I was thinking I should just go to a bar by myself just to sit there with a beer and observe people without looking as creepy as possible, but I get so nervous just thinking about going to bar by myself, or even with a friend. If my friend gets a date, will I just go back home being more depressed, and how will I over come something like that, also if I happen to get someone to like me, how will I contact them, should it be the next day, or should I wait a few days for them to remember what they did, and maybe call me first. If I call with I seem clingly or will she be waiting for me, also if I did call first, I have the thought of will she remember me? Was she too drunk at the bar and gave me her number by accident? Thinking I was better than I was and being drunk only made me seem better than I was. \nI know I just need to have the courage to take that first step but because I have so many doubts and have been rejected so many times in the harshest ways before, how will I over come that fear of being rejected over and over?"	
14574,"Do people not know all of this already in the first place...?  This is common sense right?"

Jesus loved us so much, that He died for us! His Love is clear! \n\nTime is so short, friends. These storms, earthquakes and all the wars and rumor of wars are signs Jesus taught us that will happen before that Day. \n\nPlease call upon Him today if you have not already. Tomorrow is not promised to any of us, however, salvation in Christ Jesus IS Promised. He will save you from your sins! Hallelujah!\n\nShalom! :)"

14648,"This looked like a shitty movie"	
14649,"The dialogue bits sounds a little stupid, but I have to go with what Max Landis said in an RLM video. He basically said, if the actors are great and the scene is set up well, you can sell any stupid line of dialogue and maybe even make it iconic. Just read out StarWars Han Solo this way. Anyway, the movie still looks bland and boring. Thanks for the review."

15361,"Omfg people stop complaining about Kelly's weight ...\n1.she just had 2 kids within the last few years and it might take her longer to get that off. \n2.she is a singer /songwriter not a fucking model. \n3.just because she's not a size 0 does not mean she does not have issues Kelly has even spoken in the past that she has had weight problems and its always been an up and down thing with her .\nStop acting like you are perfect , if you don't like it then go watch someone's else's video , Kelly has many fans who care about her and does not need judgemental people."

15365,"She is the only current successful artist that has come out of american idol it is amazing n she was season one winner. she had two kids bac to bac n Reba is her step mother in law. She is happy n thats all that matters not her weight! She is very talented!"	
15366,"I love how the backup singers actually have representation in the video."	
15367,"Its saddens me to once again see so much negativity towards Kelly and her weight.  She's so beautiful inside and out.  Why does anyone feel the need to say such things???  When Kelly looks back on her life she will see nothing but love despite her father.  What will you see?  Someone that leads a negative life with judgement,"	
15368,"WOW! \nAmazing and beautiful... I Love it! 👏👏👏💖💖💖👸"

15433,"i bet newt is hagrid's father"	
15434,"I always wondered\nWhat was hagrid's house when he was a student"	
15435,"YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR INTRO"	
15436,"Caffeine. His shirt is the molecular structure of caffeine."	
15437,"Answer. He got another wand....... Harry's wand broke. He just used another wand. I'm sure Dumbledore was able to pull some strings and get him and somewhat ok wand."	
15438,"Try connect all HP theories in one vid. Do they line up? I have no idea 😂"	
15439,"Wait wasn't Hagrid in his third year when he was expelled? Shouldn't that have made him 13, not 15? Or did he start school at a later age?"	
15440,"personally i like the thought that Hagrid is just accidentally amazing at wandless magic.\n\nMagic is all about intent. Because Hagrid THINKS he wand still works, it does.\n\nBit silly yeah but i find it amusing"	
15441,"why was hagrids wand snapped in the first place? newt was expelled for basically the same reason, and his wand is fine."	
15442,"So I haven't read the books and I was wondering, can magic users do magic without wands?"	
15443,"What I always wondered	 what did Lilly see in Severus?"
15444,"Newt should have been Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts ❤"	
15445,"This is an amazing theory and I really hope you're right. I would love to see Hagrid under Newt's tutelage. It would create a perfect connection to everything."	
15446,"Yea, right... But damn, I need that Slotherin pillow so bad!!"	
15447,"The books tell you what happened this isn't necessary"	
15448,"I literally didn't even notice the umbrella was pink..."	
15449,"Ben, caffeine belongs in your coffee not on your shirt. Lol"	
15450,"Hey! Did you guys know that sir Cadogan (or whatever) CAN actually be spotted in the prisoners of azkaban(movie) when the fat lady portrait is broken. You guys should make a video about it!"	
15451,"My question is why do they even have umbrellas in the wizarding world in the first place. In fantastic beasts we see them use a spell to produce an ubrella and fantastic beasts is a PREquel. So the fact that his umbrella does nothing and that his umbrella can produce an umbrella baffles me."	
15452,"💥💥💥 *mind blown*💥💥💥\nYou have No idea how happy watching this video made me. It filled in so many blanks n got me super pumped for Fantastic beasts!!! 😄😄😄\nUr awesome!"	
15453,"Please tell me the truth about OLAF in FROZEN"	
15454,"in case you didn't know there is a place in Switzerland called Grindelwald. just if you wanted that, then your welcome. however if you already knew it then... just checking."	
15455,"How is Hagrid fifteen when he is in his third year? 3:54"	
15456,"Why do we never see any magical patronus animals throughout the series? We see a phoenix from Dumbledore, but how come no students or teachers have magical creature patroni?"	
15457,"This is a great theory and I definitely hope we will get to see the duel in the movies, hopefully in the last one, but you have made one mistake, or rather not explained an apearent mistake by the books. If Grindelwald was not the master of the elder wand because he was defeated before his duel with Dumbledore, how come Dumbledore became the master of the elder wand after he beat Grindelwald. I wouldn´t even mind this plothole so much, except it is almost the same idea THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS RESULTED BY!"	
15458,"You just really destroyed my fantastic beasts experience...as if this theory is happens to be true..then I have already got the spoilers😔😔"	
15459,"Before I watch the video... Dumbledore is the owner of the elder wand. Having suspicions about tom riddle...dumbledore simply repairs the wand for Hagrid and continues to teach him magic in spare time over the years (we all know Dumbledore doesn't really value the ministry of magic's laws)...he could have easily aided Hagrid in concealing his wand and repairing it."	
15460,"If anything remotely close to this makes it's way into the fantastic beasts franchise, you should get paid."	
15461,"Cool theory, but unfortunately you don't know transfiguration. First of all, no matter how good the transfigurator is, the transfigured object can't stay in the new form forever, sooner or later it'll change back. Second of all, magic objects are non-transfigurable."	
15462,"Am I the only one who says duel like dew-e-l not dool"	
15463,"This is a great theory!!!!"	
15464,"thats truly a great and exciting theory !!!"	
15465,"I got a cherry wood wand, 14 and a half inches, phoenix core. I'm quite happy with it. =)"	
15466,"Assuming that it is Rex, can you do a video about how he ended up in Wall-E's collection? It could make quite the sad story."	
15467,"Have you ever thought that your theories are correct until you post a video out the theory? Exec producer: Well we can't use that idea any more because someone just figured it out."	
15468,"can you please please please do a video about how tom riddle wasn't an obscurial!!!!!!!"	
15469,"I was wondering do you reckon a basilisk would make an appearance in fantastic beasts and where to find them"	
15470,"I want this to be true so bad"	
15471,"Also a friend of mine ask me this how is cars born  after watching cars3"	
15472,"I used to really like these videos and then realised then I that you just use the material right off pottermore...."	
15473,"I love this theory!!!"	
15474,"You make it too difficult... Dumbledore knows due to legilimency that Hagrid didn't release the basalisk.  He knows Hagrid is being blamed for something he didn't do but can't change people's minds due to anti-giant bias.  So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states... He says that he still has the pieces to which Ollivander says he hopes he doesn't use them, to which Hagrid fumbles at the umbrella."	
15475,"I remember the yellow ball with the star on it, I remember seeing it in a show I used to watch. I just can't pinpoint which episode it is. Which show is it from?"	
15476,"To SCB's defense, i saw Seamus' video 2 weeks ago and the theories are not exactly the same. I think it's a coincidence that they made videos about similar topics and I seriously doubt they would watch Seamus' video and purposely take the idea. Seamus talked more about how Dumbledore might have mentored Hagrid and SCB talked more about his wand and how it would've been fixed and predicting his role in the next Fantastic Beasts movie. Y'all are getting upset over something that's not a huge issue. I hope they come out and say something."	
15477,"Maybe Newt is a relative of Hagrid somehow?"	
15478,"the real question is who should play Hagrid\npersonally i say The Mountain from Game of Thrones"	
15479,"Do you hear that? I think it's the sound of all of your viewers minds simultaneously\nexploding!"	
15480,"Hey Brother ! I need to presentate myself for my class. I'm a nerd and I think the most of us here (what is awesome). I was searching on YouTube, but I couldn't find a really good clip of it. So I thought that you could explain in a clip how awesome and cool it is to be a nerd.thumbs if you want to see this happen.And please comment on this."	
15481,"Ok. Ready. Harry didn't get the elder wand from Draco. But he got it in the cave from the half blood prince. When Harry makes dumbledore drink the potion that makes him relive his worst memory. He drop his wand"	
15482,"When I was young I thought Hagrid was weird for hanging out with little kids but now that I'm older he has become my favorite character. I wish he was my friend lol"	
15483,"i wish the cc did not fill the whole screen."	
15484,"Love this theory guys, I hope the theory appears to be true in the upcoming FB movies."	
15485,"Hi Love this video 💖 I have an amazing idea for a new series that you should both watch Once Upon A Time which is on Netflix ❤️"	
15486,"Hagrid was 13/14 when expelled. Not 15. He was a third year. So unless he was held back..."	
15487,"Harry didn't win elder wand from voldemort... he won from draco malfoy"	
15488,"If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^"	
15489,"It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand."	
15490,"Loving the Woody and Buzz toys in the background by the way"	
15491,"I just thought that Dumbledore secretly fixed Hagrid's wand with the elder wand because he knew that Hagrid had nothing to do with the incidents."	
15492,"I just realized Quidditch teams could just go to the room of requirement and get a bunch of steroids and firebolts."	
15493,"If your names not j k Rowling hen your theory is bs! And her and warner bros sue any one who tries to monetise off of Harry Potter"	
15494,"What a cool theory I hope this is right"	
15495,"Fantastic theory! I really hope it's right"	
15496,"Are you guys Christians"	
15497,"omg this my first vid watching a vid of yours in 2017"	
15498,"I've thought Dumbledore repaired hayride wand for a long time"	
15499,"what house was Hagrid in?"	
15500,"3:58 Wasn't Hagrid expelled in his 3rd year? I'm pretty sure he stated in the first book that he was expelled in his third year."	
15501,"I would absolutely love to see a young Hagrid. And a scenario like this would be great. It would explain so much and add such depth to Hagrid's character."	
15502,"As much as I like Hagrid, and as horrible as it was that Hagrid got blamed for Myrtle Warren's death, I agree with his expulsion because he did have a dangerous monster in the castle, even if it wasn't the one causing the attacks. Acromantulas eat humans, and having one in a school... yeah, Hagrid deserved to be expelled and should never have been a teacher."	
15503,"Harry did not win it from Voldemort. He won it from Draco Malfoy"	
15504,"That would make so much sense"	
15505,"Pausing at 42 seconds.\n\nDumbledore it's alwayse deus ex dumbledore.\n\nI so hope I right making this WAG."	
15506,"I came up with this theory like 2 years ago I mean you just had to connect the dots in the books."	
15507,"But if newt has already beaten grindlewald with his beasts could that mean newt is the master of the elder wand and neither Harry or dumbledore have ever been the masters"

15569,"Alan Sealls is his name! What a great, informative piece of weather reporting! Really like this guy!"	
15570,"Alan Sealls, You Could Sell a Pot of Steam Babay  Highly Knowledgeable and Well Spoken,\n#TheGreatElucidator"

15574,"this was incredible!!! I learned a lot, it was well detailed and now I understand why hurricanes can change course over time ❤️👏🏼"	
15575,"I hope he becomes the next Al Roker, because Al was always a bit of a putz and this guy is an incredible science communicator. So many people need to hear the news like this again. Maybe then, people would stop thinking every damn thing is a conspiracy, but I doubt it."	
15576,"This reminds me of watching the news when I was a little kid. Before everyone had cable, internet and phones we were much more pragmatic as a whole."	
15577,"1:08 Now, the models don't control the weather. Only an American weather forecaster would have to explain that to his audience."	
15578,"Incredible, simply one of th easiest and best foecasts"	
15579,"I love how he assumes that we might think his weather models could control the weather. He says it multiple times. That's why this vid went viral."	
15580,"THE best explanation of the current hurricane situation I've yet seen. Thanks to Mr. Sealls for a sober, clearly-articulated presentation."	
15581,"OMG what a fabulous forecaster!  Mr. Sealls is the 'only' weather forecaster in my 73 years of life who has not used severe weather to spread unnecessary fear and anxiety throughout the land only so that he accumulates ratings.  He is extremely factual and informative with the calmness necessary to assure viewers that they need to be aware and take his information seriously due to the fact that this hurricane is very destructive.  He should be made a national forecaster immediately because of his calm demeanor and factual content without scaring the bejesus out of people, especially old people such as myself.  I want to thank him for being the BEST WEATHER FORECASTER - BAR NONE."	
15582,"ALAN SEALLS IS A LEGEND"	
15583,"i like how this is basically a weather lesson ... \nand the fact that he has to emphasize the projection doesn't control the weather is just hilarious cus it shows how many people think the forecast is THE route the hurricane will take LOL"

15765,"what is the brand of m.shadows cap that appears at the beginning of the video?"	
15766,"Nice to see them continually evolving and growing. That's something that The Rev would have loved. He was always trying/doing new things and helped pushed them in a lot of new directions.  For the people complaining about this, this is what AV7X has always done. It's not all always metal. You haven't been paying attention if you're just realizing this now. Brooks Wackerman seems to be a big help in their continued growth. No disrespect to Arin Ilejay, a monster drummer who stepped in when they needed him most but I was worried it wouldn't last. His inexperience and lack of a broad musical background would make it hard.  Plus that was a very hard and trying time for Avenged. This too is probably part of the healing process."

15792,"Awesome! imo syn sounds great acapella at the end but during the song (especially last chorus) he is overpowered by shadows to the point of sounding flat. Just my 2cents. Incredible band nonetheless and I would watch ANY cover ANY day! \n\nWhile we're on the topic of covers, it would absolutely blow my mind if a7x/m.shadows did a cover of Geoff Tate/Queensryche. Their voices are 2 of my favorites and I feel they would compliment each other beautifully. More specifically, to hear Geoff Tate cover Brompton Cocktail...no words 😍"

16120,"God is Dope!!!!....ayeee"	
16121,"I really hate this style of hip hop that has become popular in the last couple years and I resent that my favorite Christian artists seem to have fallen into this hole as well.  When rap legends are coming out being vocal about how AWFUL this style of hip hop is, perhaps artists should listen instead of mass-producing this boring auto-tuned garbage."

16158,"I'm Christian, but I can easily say that about 99.9% of Christians who listen to music are trippin. If music boring, then it isn't Christian according to most Christians. People like to say lecrae sold out and that he isn't Christian anymore just because he's starting to make fun music. I honestly don't get why ya'll cant just enjoy the music."	
16159,"DOPE!!! Thank you Lecrae for looking out for the dance artists too!!!\ncheck out our Jr Squad video to Hammer Time on our page. let us know what yaw think\nhttps://youtu.be/4PR3D2QiJHk"

16167,"wait a min.. you have kids?"	
16168,"The music you put in this video is aids. The volume is just quiet enough to make it obnoxious."	
16169,"Still, if you don't need the S-pen easy pick, S8+ is 350 euro's cheaper"	
16170,"I'll just stay here with my c9 pro"	
16171,"chinese fans want to see xiaomi mix2！"	
16172,"still love my note 4... upgrading time might take the S8 plus. really dont use the pen that much."	
16173,"Now what? Even this clown is reviewing phones? He basically collected all negative side of it and made a video.\nListen, S-Pen has more precision then a finger. Ask people who used it since the original Note. People do a lot other stuff with it, not just to open apps.\nIf your finger is so small that you don't need an S-Pen. Most of us find it useful. \nFunny when a pc builder review phones. He hated the phone before he even put one on his hand. Just search the August 23rd video when he's with other reviewers."	
16174,"I am not going to pay over 500 $ for that tho..."	
16175,"5:09 I just realized that I might be racist."	
16176,"i have a note 4 and its still the best one they made, 4k pictures, never lags, removable battery, 64gb sd card + 32gb hdd, no bixby and some come pre-rooted, its great :P"	
16177,"I love this new style of review video you put out, Linus. :D"	
16178,"It has a smaller battery but many people have uploaded videos showing the Note 8 out performing many other phones including the S8+. \nEveryone has been hating on Bixby but I was blown away after seeing a Siri, Google and Bixby comparison. Bixby is smart and is growing more intelligent every day."	
16179,"you should stick to computer/it tech rather than phones,,,\nps:dislike for using you friend unfortunate event Austin Evans as a joke or what you thought would be funny...."	
16180,"bxActions still works to remap really well. I have it set as a flashlight button."	
16181,"Thank you for the honest review, instead of just jumping on the band wagon and saying it's awesome. I have a Note 5 and much prefer it over the Note 8. Samsung also downgraded the camera by 4MP. Note 5 has a 16MP camera! That curved displays are just plain stupid, makes it way easier to break."	
16182,"OLED, AMOLED, Super AMOLED, Super AMOLED HD - I just wish they had a universal language - this is the first time in years I have heard a Samsung screen be called OLED - most recently the LG V30 - if its AMOLED just say AMOLED why confuse the words jezzus"	
16183,"Well, the Dual Sim is a pretty big deal for some people :)"	
16184,"Soon you'll praise the iphone 8 for no reason ..."	
16185,"They are not gonna change everything for you. At the end of the day it's their phone.  They keep the s pen cause that's the main purpose of the phone and to have big specs..not battery. What do you expect if it does it almost all? And they aren't gonna do everything right away. They did pretty damn good, you aren't getting good speakers right away so calm down, they had other things that were needed more."	
16186,"Wow this sad af just buy a s8"	
16187,"Nice implimentation of Austin's burned flat :'D"	
16188,"I want this phone just to make masterpieces in snapchat"	
16189,"Something about this review doesn't feel genuine..."	
16190,"I have hands as small as Donald Trump"	
16191,"Did you just wink at me sir?"	
16192,"Now I dnt find something unique in ur videos bro ,,,, 😒 use to be fun to watch ur video"	
16193,"Almost $1000?  I could buy like 500 Amazon Fire Phones for that."	
16194,"Love your work sir.. been watching you for years now."	
16195,"Dam was this a note 8 bashing I'm glad when I received mine I love it, and didn't listen to some of yall reviewer's"	
16196,"I'm confused... what wouldn't you give up 200mA hours of battery life for, the S-PEN?   That's nuts.   200mA is insignificant compared to the value the S-PEN brings to the device."	
16197,"You are tooo harsh on Note 8 \nSpecially when it has all the features which even Flagship phones don't \n. \nThat way you should roast normal phones \nI don't see you harsh on normal phones"	
16198,"Adjust my grip and start writing? What? Dude you sound like a female OMG! Just whining and whining and whining WTF dude! I dont care about Apple or Samsung I'm just saying you nip picked your ass off on this one brother! Oh & there was no Note 7 recall remember?? Soooooo???? Just saying man."	
16199,"I fucking want it"	
16200,"Wait what?! Linus can 540 kick? O.o well done sir!"	
16201,"Too much knit picking dude. As an all in one gadget. I think this one tops it !"	
16202,"I'm sick of dbrand ads"	
16203,"Note 8 has long lasting battery due to its software optimization"	
16204,"Is that a set or green screen?"	
16205,"Not an impressive review, but then again opinions are what makes the world go-around I guess. If you can replace the s pen with your finger, boy I would love to see that one...lol. The dual camera is a plus for me, IMO. Too much clownish batter Linus,  but then again some people like to be entertained....You missed this one Linus, thumbs down!"	
16206,"Hahaha you are very funny... very bad video... you tried to much to make this video... dislike of course"	
16207,"I like the Note line but this #8. Way crazy over priced IMHO. I also think the S8 is over priced as well. These phones have just gotten too expensive over the years."	
16208,"Holy cow your entire staff has tiny hands. I'm a 17 year old Asian kid. I'm average height and weigh under 130. My note 8 (got it a week early thanks Best Buy) is perfectly sized for fingerprint. So either I have big hands or you have Trump hands."	
16209,"Linus, you are like the morning dosage of caffeine I can't get through my day without it. We love you, we need you, we are addicted, don't you dare quitting on us! :)"	
16210,"Wait....Squeeze input? You've held the U11 then!"	
16211,"Fuck. The price fucked this up. This video ALMOST made me buy this phone."	
16212,"What's with the two sexually ambivalent Asian dudes?"	
16213,"Linus....I personally respect your unbiased option.  I appreciate the review and I wont be upgrading for a few gimmicks"	
16214,"Small penis"	
16215,"Trash talker!!!!"

16222,"shut the fuck up!"	
16223,"Don't you think holding a movie in your hand is a bit of a stretch?"	
16224,"The part when the note 7 was a sticky bomb in gta was funny"	
16225,"Your reviews suck !  did not even heard any tech specs"	
16226,"Mmm galaxy note pro 12.3 or something like that.... not that good at maths but I think that means that the screen is bigger"	
16227,"0:07 wth, i did not know that Linus could do crap like this"	
16228,"My mom has a s8 and the finger print was weird  at first but after 2 days it was normal and weird for me when I use my s7 egde"	
16229,"I was told that if you play a YouTube video on note 8, it won't be in the full screen! It will be the same size as Iphone plus. Is that true?!!"	
16230,"I prefer the Note 8 because i don't really like the curved screen on the S8+. Otherwise it's basically the same as the S8+. Think i wasted my money but whatever"	
16231,"Remember IPhone Users... if it wasn't for Samsung deleting the home button, there wouldn't be a Iphone 8"	
16232,"can't ask for more, this phone is perfect\nfor the artist, jot an idea or painting everywhere or even serious work with a smartphone are great,\nbut other manufacturer didn't even take a glimpse on bringing the digitizer stylus to smartphone\n\nI didn't even ask for that dual camera and that zoom\nbut the idea of jot some semi-professional photography idea straight from the phone are like a Christmas gift\n\npeople are bullying the idea of having an active digitizer on a smartphone,\nbut just respect it, many people are willing to pay 1000$ and more just because the idea of getting productive everywhere,"	
16233,"Still can't wait for the Pixel 2"	
16234,"I agree with Linus!  I have the s8 .I say Samsung should just add an s pen and dual camera to it. And put some stereo speakers too! There's  nothing special about the note 8 except that's it's as big as a buiding. I need to also say Bixby sucks ."

Linus just sounds confused. Why is everyone in comparing the note 8 To a phone which most people do not have because they were waiting for the note 8? nobody's going to basically downgrade just for a little bit of battery life.

Two when they were kittens (12+ years ago) and a rehomed cat, 1-2 years old (the previous owner couldn't remember exactly how old he was...)\n\nI remember getting my kittens. My other cat had died a year earlier and I missed having a cat so much. My mom would drive us to the Humane Society every week to check for kittens. The third week they were there! A little older than I was expecting (12-14 weeks), but the Humane Society probably waited to put them up for adoption until they were a little older.\nI'm definitely a cat person. They're awesome."

16604,"You should also tell people about the juvenile stage"	
16605,"Lactose free milk is an ok treat, but remember it should be a treat only! it should not be given every day for meals, and DO NOT REPLACE KITTEN FOOD WITH IT!!! If you find an stray and hungry cat(kitten) meats like bologna and tuna can be a good temporary meal, remember that KITTENS need specialized food because they are still growing"	
16606,"Ok so you guys live somewhere because your all British"

16608,"My kitten was weaned young. If you have a kitten like this buy it a bottle (even though it doesn't need it) and every few day give them about a 1\2 tablespoon of milk. This will make the kitten feel more at ease with not being around mum. I did this with my baby boy until he bit through his bottle. It really helped him relax and he quit crying."

16610,"In Pawtrait, there was a cute pic of the baby Simon's cat on the wall. :)"	
16611,"I absolutely love kittens.  After the kitten is... 'dispatched' and skinned, remove the head and tail, trim out the larger meat fillets, dip into a mixture of beaten egg and basil, coat lightly with breadcrumbs, and bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  Serve with mini red potatoes, asparagus with a drizzle of lemon-butter.  The me - yow factor is off the charts!"	
16612,"I hear everytime that appartment cats have to have another cat as a playmate. Because as i was young we had a cat and he didnt had a playmate. And my cat doesnt have one either. Just me and my family. But a friend says everytime that my cat needs another cat as a playmate. Is that true?"	
16613,"Adult cats are pretty awesome choices too if you are looking for a cat. No potty training, they still bond to you, they are chill (most of the time). Even when I adopted the really mean older cats, they turned into cuddle bugs after a few days because they are out of a stressful environment. :)"	
16614,"and this is why you set up the camera first. Simon never learns."	
16615,"Oh you quickly learn not to give your cat milk even if he loves it so much and meows so desperately when you have milk in your hands - cleaning the litter box of cat diarrhea is not my favorite."	
16616,"Nicky gives so much of wrong information away. No good for anyone who really relies on that information. Many people have already written about the information:\n- no milk (kittens and cats are lactose intolerant)\n- leave the kitten alone when it just arrived and allow it to settle\n- adopt at least two kittens, not only one\nWhat I haven't read yet is about the age. Adopting a kitten when it's only 6 or 8 weeks old, is way too early. Kittens must not be separated from their mother until they're at least 12 weeks old! And please make sure that neither you or a family member has an allergy against cat hair before adopting."	
16617,"Flagged and reported this video as hate speech."	
16618,"Where are all the black and white cute vids and higinks"	
16619,"What about don't tickle a cats belly unless it's learning as it's not really something a cat wants nor accepts most of the time. It shows its belly as trust not as a sign for a belly rub."	
16620,"You can give a kitten goats milk it doesn't have as much sugar in it to upset the kittens tummy. All your vet. I use it when many cat isn't feeling good. I warm it before feeding it to him. He's 19 yrs old."

16624,"2 me there are 2 things about kittens to know. I love kittens.(adopted a blind on that was weeks from birth. Sadly died falling from a high spot. Sad sad moment.) 2 my landlord is antipets and he is evil....(it makes sense though pets can cause some issues.)"	
16625,"There are 2 cats in my neighborhood that I feed.  The boy enjoys leftover milk from my morning cereal.  The girl will generally leave it alone- unless the boy is around to drink it."	
16626,"I like the way she says Kitten!"	
16627,"Milk no no cuddles, love,  playtime, and sleep ( with or without human) excuse me, my kitten is halfway up my curtains!!!"	
16628,"what pisses me off is people dumping kittens on the side of roads when shelters cant keep kittens there always adapted out. its fully grown cats and dogs that they have issues finding new homes for."	
16629,"Good points. I like the presentations with Nicky. Lots of good information for cat parents or people thinking about becoming cat parents."	
16630,"Good job recommending the shelters and rescue facilities.  They have so many cats both kitten and senior that need good homes!"	
16631,"I love Simon's Cat videos.  They remind me so much about my own four mystic moggies who, sadly, are no longer with us."	
16632,"so are nicky and simon hooked up??    she's a diamond.........and she has an engagement ring on"	
16633,"Can you do What Things You Need To Know About Adult (or Senior) Cats?"	
16634,"You should probably say another animal's milk or cow's milk. It's strange and unhealthy for any being to drink the milk of a different species 💙 Not to mention the cruelty involved in obtaining milk from the mother."	
16635,"can you do a video on feral cats?"	
16636,"I prefer 1+-year-old cats over kittens.  Sure, kittens are cute, but older cats are more level and easier to train (*less* distracted).  Also, you should point-out the importance of teaching basic commands (sit,  stay, down).  Many people let their cats get away with little/no training without seeing the complete joy of having a properly-trained cat.\nNeither of my cats had issues with milk.  They never got a lot, but a tiny bowl one or twice a month was a special treat.  Fluffy (20) even liked a little melted ice cream…when we had room in the freezer.  Tony (14) just liked a little milk, especially when he'd try to steal it from my Coonhound, Lilly.  You could tell that it was a power issue because he NEVER did that with Sue (15), our late Heeler mix."	
16637,"That was very informative and very entertaining to watch good job Simon"	
16638,"I do find some of the narratives helpful and I learn something new everytime I see an episode!!"	
16639,"She's a cutie."	
16640,"Loving this! I am the proud foster mommy of 5 tiny tumbling tigers.  It's so much fun to watch them learn and relate to my 4 adult cats, who have stepped in to help care for them by disciplining them, washing them and of course, playing. Trying to get staged photos of them is exactly like this, the minute one poses beautifully, one of their siblings or an adult cat steps right in."	
16641,"Dear Simon's Cat friends. This is a public forum that kids looks at. Dropping F bombs arguing about cat food is ridiculous and juvenile. Remember, yours is just an opinion, not fact. Everyone is entitled to theirs. My cats are 14 ,15 and 17, are super healthy and have eaten Purina dry for half of their lives. Now they have Iams dry food. NO wet food. They have great teeth and seem really happy and playful. That works for me and them, but maybe not you. Be happy your pet is healthy and stick with what works for you. Try being nice to other people, and your pets will think you're pretty cool for acting like them."	
16642,"My cat would follow my mum around every morning meowing what sounded like milk until she gave it to him. It wasn't until he got older that he had trouble with milk. He couldn't tell rice milk apart from cow milk. Either that or he didn't care. Later both he and his sister lost the ability to digest any kind of cat treat. We still wanted to reward good behavior. They had no problems with their kibble. So I simply put some kibble in a separate container. When they earned a treat, I got some from the special container. They were just as excited as if it were something other than what they always eat. So presentation was all that mattered. Cheaper too."	
16643,"The end was Savage as fuk"	
16644,"i love the cats 😻😻😻😻"	
16645,"My cat is highly lactose intolerant lol when she was a baby she used to get sick from her mums milk but she's healthy strong and beautiful"	
16646,"I just said goodbye to my senior kitty. The last thing I really wanted to do was bring kittens into the house but I was alerted to 16 kittens desperately needing homes. I took 2 home. I  am nursing an injured leg and need to rest it a lot.  The kittens insist that my face is the best place to lay down and sleep. I realize how bored I woul be without these 2 kittens!  Figaro and Octavia."	
16647,"Is it true that, for a kitten, playtime is just as important as a good diet? I don't remember where I got this information from. The kittens that I've ever had, when they wanted to play I did my best to provide play time. When they wanted to rest, they were allowed to rest. They grew up to be fine cats."	
16648,"I have a kitten named Zeus and each time you cuddle with him he'll start sucking on a blanket or Whatever he can reach, i know this is from him being away from his mother too early, but i was was wondering if there is anything i should do?"	
16649,"We recently got a beautiful black kitten from a rescue shelter. If anybody wants to see her then there's a video on my channel!"	
16650,"You can buy Cat milk :)))"	
16651,"Cats are lactose intolerant, like me. My cat loves yogurt and ice cream, like me. We fart together"	
16652,"Do yourself a favor and get an older cat from the shelter. Kittens are super cute but older cats are less likely to get adopted so they need you more. Plus they are much calmer and you will know exactly what kind of character they have. If you have ever experienced the havoc a kitten can wreak on your home, you know what I'm talking about."	
16653,"my cat sometimes goes on the couch, stick her paws into the cushions, then whips her head around meowing before doing flips and turns. If anybody is wondering she's a tortie calico mix."	
16654,"It's a common misconception, that cats need milk. Is it? I always thought everyone knows, that cats WANT and LIKE milk but as all mammals they don't really need it. I was mislead by my brain... O.o"

Everyone borrows from everyone.The end result of any new endeavor, however, results in that project being unique in its own way (unless you've blatantly ripped off another's work with word-for-word dialogue, etc).\n\nPixar's Toy Story? Similar to the novel The Brave Little Toaster. A Bug's Life ? Based on the 1954 movie The Seven Samurai. Frozen ? Based on the Danish book The Snow Queen.\n\nThis movie being similar to The Book of Life would just be a continuation of the tradition, although this seems to borrow a little too heavily, visual-wise..."

17501,"Why do all the Mexican pixar films involve guitars?"	
17502,"The Book of Life didn't live up to my expectations, the animation style wasn't my favorite and there were some scenes that didn't sit well with me. I hope Coco is different, the animation looks worlds beyond BOF at least, and I like the idea that it follows a young boys adventure in order to follow his dreams without the romance plot."

S7 edge has wqhd 2560 x 1440p and 538 PPi density STILL better quality screen than apple. Apple os? Still shitty. No customization everyone has the same looking home screen. It's just trash dude. Only reason iPhones are fast is because of the simple Operating system. And it's still not that much faster. Just now catching up with wireless charging,just now catching up with fast Charging, just now getting an OLED, doesn't even have a headphone jack and they couldn't make it ip68 water resistant? Pathetic. Worth $1000? Absolutely not. Forced to use face id? Trash.they force you to use their ecosystem, stupid. Still no external storage? Ridiculous.  Simple phone for simple people. Just my opinion but I don't get how people can pay that much for a you can't use to its full potential"

17571,"I have the iPhone 7 plus but I'm going on have to wait until next year for to get an upgrade. I'm leaning towards the iPhone X. I saw the presentation in the Apple Store yesterday online"

17606,"I have an iPhone 6s Plus. This is my first iPhone from being an android user. Had the phone for about over a year. This phone has actually lasted a bit longer (as far as malfunctions or any serious damage) than I was expecting. Glad to see people get excited about something and yes the price tag sounds expensive but if you think about these phones are pretty much miniaturized computers that allow us to do business and personal things. Some people have started their careers on YouTube or other media. And also you look familiar like you been on tv?"	
17607,"The new design and colors are the only things I'm interested"	
17608,"I'm happy people are excited, but I will keep my compact, inexpensive, headphone-compatible iPhone SE, thank you very much. 	)"
17609,"The iPhone X is a rip off. It doesn't offer IP68 water resistance like the Note 8, or Galaxy S8, or heck even the Galaxy S7 for that matter. It doesn't have a headphone jack and instead requires an easy to lose dongle and gives you yet more stuff to carry around that a $1,000 phone should not require. Yeah that dongle screams premium. /)_<\n\nThe iPhone X does not support fast charging out of the box and requires you to buy two more adapters to carry around in addition to your headphone dongle just to get it to work and yet even more money spent. \n\nThe iPhone X now supports wireless charging! Yea! But unlike the Galaxy S8/Note 8 does not support fast wireless charging. \n\niPhone X starts out at $999.99 before tax and offers no MicroSD card slot for expansion, instead forcing you to spend $150.00 more for 256GB, which is still less memory than what you would get had the 64GB iPhone X just supported MicroSD cards. You could have popped in a 256GB card and had 320GB of storage for that same $150 upgrade. And it would be removable! Just pop it into your desktop for simple copy and paste file transfer to a hard drive and your done. But nope, you need to wire up to your PC and use the cluttered iTunes program, or the incredibly slow data munching cloud service to transfer files. \n\nSo who wants to take bets that the new improved camera on the iPhone X will still record all audio in mono sound when shooting a video, instead of Stereo like every other phone. (In 2017 the iPhone 7 still records in mono.) \n\nAnd so much for that OLED screen. I said that Samsung doesn't sell their best AMOLED screens to competitors, as the Galaxy gets the best of the best. I was right.  \n\nThe Note 8 has a Super AMOLED display that produces over 1,200 nits of brightness and has a 2,960 x 1,440P, 6.3 inch display, with a pixel density of 522. The Galaxy Note8 is certified by the UHD Alliance for Mobile HDR Premium. And it has full 100% DCI-P3 Color Gamut. \n\nThe iPhone X has a 5.8 inch display (5.15 usable) with a resolution of 2,436 x 1,135 (Apple calls this a Super Retina display.)\nThe display has a nit brightness of 625. (It won't be as viewable on sunny days in comparison to the Note 8 which is 2X brighter.) \n\nThe iPhone X screen has a pixel density of 458 PPI. \n\nThe iPhone X uses very cumbersome and likely not truly reliable face unlock tech for mobile payments and access to your phone. It also has support for traditional pass words which would be the wiser of the two main options. \n\nThe Galaxy S8/Note 8 also have face unlock, in addition to Retina unlocking and passwords. Plus they have very reliable fingerprint scanners unlike the iPhone X for access to the phone and for mobile payments.   \n\nAnd finally the Note 8 and the iPhone X both support Augmented Reality tech. However only the Galaxy S8/Note 8 support proper VR.\n\nSo is the iPhone X worth a $1,000.00??? Not in my opinion. Especially since the iPhone X isn't a $1,000.00 when purchased. You have to figure this → $999.99 + say Wisconsin sales tax of 5.1% for example if you just happen to live in that state. Now the phone costs $1,050.99 + those spiffy adapters that you need to purchase for your fast charging, which brings you up to another $75.00 or so. Plus now add $200.00 for Apple Care+ and finally you may need a case, so there 's another $35.00 ~ $75.00 for you. So realistically your spending about $1,400 for the phone. \n\nSo should you buy the iPhone X? That's up to you. It's your money. To each their own. \nShow less\nREPLY"	
17610,"The real question and I hope you make a video of is Face ID vs Touch ID. A lot of people such as myself feel like they should've made Touch ID an option and implemented either on the back or power button (which is no longer the name of it.) how can people like myself look pass Touch ID and learn to adapt to Face ID. I like being able to go to the bank or shopping to use Apple Pay and not worrying bout looking at my iPhone and swiping up to active Apple Pay."	
17611,"I don't know, I am honestly still deeply thinking about whether I should get the iPhone 8 plus or the iPhone X. I mean I like how the 8 plus has a big screen which I'm used to but at the same time I love the design and concept of the X."	
17612,"Thoroughly unimpressed as I type this from my S8 plus. I wanted to be excited for the new iPhone too. The fact that they are asking $1k+ for it when you can pick up an S8 for under $600 now is also laughable. Sorry to say but Samsung has had the smartphone game on lock the past 2 years and it doesn't look like that's about to change anytime soon."	
17613,"I'm going to wait next years iphone, and next year iphone x will be cheaper...."	
17614,"Why isn't the iPhone 8 named iPhone VIII when the iPhone X is called iPhone 10 if that's the case.  Was OSX called OS 10?  Apple makes good products, but they take the naming and terminology used for marketing of their products too far."

The word should not be publicised by rappers or anyone, it's the reason why people don't think twice when the word comes to mouth. 95% of the time when people say the word it isn't to cause offence, so can we ban the word all together or make it not an offensive word."	
17645,"Felix control your crazy fans instead of having them childish tear down a beautiful game like Firewatch"	
17646,"You are part of the problem."	
17647,"This clip was just on the news here:\n\nJust a one and a half minute video, you can really tell he does'nt mean a thing, he does this time to time"	
17648,"Felix is such a sound guy he the type of guy to borrow a COD game and give it back no scratches 100% condition"	
17649,"Out of all the horrible shit going on in this world, y'all gotta hop on Pewds for saying a single word that most of y'all have said at least once in your life time"	
17650,"Hi pewpeipie: You make a lot of money on youtube. Your apology was awful. There are several instances where you failed to acknowledge the severity of you behavior. If you cannot, on your own, address your public presence and your own actions, you need to employ someone who can. The next time you fuck up, find someone with more sincerity than you to write your copy. I will do it, for money. I am more sincere and apologetic when I don't do the dishes. It is not hard to express real shame and ownership of your actions. If you need help, I can help you. For money."	
17651,"I personally forgive you I have been there before but with only one person who knew for you to take ownership for something like this in front of almost 7mill ppl is amazing and keep up the good work :)"	
17652,"Words are neutral, it's the intent that matters.  People get more offended over words than they do actions these days. If this is what causes the world to standstill for a day then people are going to be in for a rough time in the coming decades."	
17653,"Damn it sucks when you're white"	
17654,"Come on pewds we all make mistakes, you are a good guy , see ya bro 	)"
17655,"Thanks Pewds for Making this video. We keep support on you bro! Brofist 👊 #BroArmy"

17659,"Why is the n word held to such a high stander  no, no one should be saying the n word and being black does not give you the right to say it and quit acting like all whites are racist, it's more racist marching around calling whites racist cracks that need to be burned"	
17660,"I'm behind you 100% pewdie. I'll admit I didn't like you very much back when you were just a let's play channel, but since you've opened up more, I find myself clicking on all of your videos. What drew me to you is your decision to just be yourself, rather than trying to be what you thought everyone wanted. I know it gets tricky when it comes to the n-word, but I personally prefer the uncensored pewdiepie. Don't let it get you down, you do you man."	
17661,"Apology & acknowledgement of accountability aside, you have to face the music buddy. The racist accusations prior to this blunder is why it is being blown out of proportion as per how your loyal subs are putting it. I don't think ppl are butt hurt at the fact that you used the word. I believe the resentment lies in the fact that you have been rebutting claims of racial bigotry for some time now & your use of the word, more importantly, the context in which it was used, has legitimized said allegations & has discredited your defense in the entire situation. A person who feels lied to will look at you sideways. Good luck Pewdie."	
17662,"We live in a world where 'literally' can literally mean the opposite of literally. Words means nothing, it's all about the intent. He was angry at a person and chose the worst word he could think of on a whim. It wasn't meant in a racist way, obviously, so people making this about race are just being stupid. But that's not what some people are freaking out over, most of this hate is from people who want to live off of youtube money, because it's easy and fast money. God forbid they have to get a real job."	
17663,"It takes a man to apologize for something that big. It was just an accident and he regrets it."	
17664,"Honestly, we all know he didn't mean it in a bad way. It's not like he poked fun at the history linked to it, he just said it as a curse word. like fuck and everything else. Why are people getting butthurt over this? Seriously. People just wanna make drama out of nothing."	
17665,"You wouldn't of said it in anger if you dont regularly say it. It rolled of your tongue like nothing."	
17666,"people is making a big deal about felix accidentally saying the n word we all make mistakes and try fixing it thats what makes us human"	
17667,"What is sad, more than anything is the amount of young black suburban kids defending you. So low in self worth they would accept your bs apology."	
17668,"90% of people hating on pewds probably say the n word more than he has. It's all about money and exposure, sparking up any drama to bring in traffic and revenue. Don't let the media get to you, which I know can be hard since you're always a target. Great people have slip ups, doesn't tarnish your amazing legacy and charity work. You raise millions of dollars for charity but news outlets are too worried about a word that mostly white people get offended about."	
17669,"Nice one Felix, anyone who watches your videos regularly would know you're not the racist asshole the media perceives you as. Everybody makes mistakes in the heat of the moment, I know I have. It's not like I didn't think you would respond with a formal apology, but I'm glad you did all the same. Watching that live stream, I knew the moment you said it that it had no meaning behind it, not to you. At the end of the day, you can take this as a learning experience and so can every other youtuber x"

17672,"I have been a fan for a long time and still am, you have helped me through some tough times and i like most of you comedy.\nthis was disappointing:("	
17673,"I like how everyone is like “ITS THE MEDIA’S FAULT” when Pewdiepie isn’t even blaming the media... he said a word that he probably shouldn’t have said and he claimed responsibility and apologized and people are saying that it’s not a big deal and even though that might be true to you it might not be true to other people and pewdiepie knows how people look up to him and he just wanted to say to his fans he is sorry if anyone was offended, that’s it. everyone acting like the world is out to fucking get them... get the fuck over yourselves... (90% of people who dislike this comment are probably hypocritical 10-22 year old people who talk about how “media” is out to get them and watch Angry Feminist Complications or some bullshit like that... get a fucking life)😤"	
17674,"Biggest problem with the word is it wont stop beeing used aslong as it's accepted beeing used by African Americans,   Especially in situations like PewDiePie's,   he Blurted out a Negative Word to release his anger and in those momments you don't really think through what you are / were gonna say you just  react more or less and use something from your vocabulary, and aslong as you keep hearing the N word in movies / tv series and african american youtubers using it and music,  it's gonna be in our minds, and vocabulary and it will keep comming up.\n\nso chose,  either make the word less of a deal,  just ignore the negative sides of it and let it pass into history eventually..\nOR make it just as bad to use for everyone and unaccaptable in any video / movie / Tv series / Music, by any actor / host / famous person,  no matter the background."	
17675,"You have racists defending your use of a racial epithet	 you don't deserve to have any sponsors. You don't deserve to be a public figure in the gaming industry. This guy is viewed by millions of impressionable children and he is an influence. You are way too irresponsible."
17676,"Roses are red..\nTrees are way bigger....\n\nAll this fuss, over a gamer saying *igger."	
17677,"Pewdiepie your such a good person 🙂"

17681,"People make mistakes pewds, we love you and i hope people respect your apology and see you as who you are and what you try to be. Always a fan, always behind you! Im glad you owned up to your mistake. 💕💕💕"	
17682,"LOL! No, no, no. I'm sick of y'all tryna smooth it out for being racist. You said so own it, Felix. Don't throw rocks and then hide yo' hand. You're lucky that this is only an Internet thing. Again, own it. No excuses. *Ownership.* And quit speakin' through yo' nose. Nasally self. I'm done. Witcho lil' ugly ass..."	
17683,"omfg it's just a word, what da hell happens with world in 2017"	
17684,"Personally for PewdiePie to say a word IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT and being accused by so many people out there of him saying it... I think it was being dragged. Yes I know the N word is not a common word to say at all but he could have also said Bi*ch or Bas*ard or anything else that would have targeted others still... \n\nShould not have said it, but hey it’s not the end of the world either. We should focus on more things in life"	
17685,"It takes a real man to admit to their mistakes"	
17686,"did he say the n word?"	
17687,"Those saying get over it and it's just a word or he slipped up. Nigger is not a word you blurt out 1 time. The history behind that word makes all the worse and those who are saying get over it are not affected by it and for him to say it in that context with that energy tells me he says it in everyday day life off camera. Can't respect that, he showed his true colors"	
17688,"I have never subscribed to your channel even since you first made me laugh a while back...  I think its finally time..."	
17689,"Everybody is racist at some point. I forgive you Felix."	
17690,"The next keem 😂😂😂😂 \n\nIt's a joke. I got heated in the moment '-' lol no really it's a joke."	
17691,"To quote Ian Carter	\nEither everything's okay, or nothing is."
17692,"I was upset and disappointed at what he said, but he apologized and it seems really sincere so I'm going to forgive him and move on."	
17693,"Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. Enacted by white Democratic-dominated state legislatures in the late 19th century after the Reconstruction period, these laws continued to be enforced until 1965. They mandated de jure racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America, starting in 1896 with a separate but equal status for African Americans in railroad cars. Public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War. This principle was extended to public facilities and transportation, including segregated cars on interstate trains and, later, buses. Facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to those which were then available to European Americans	 sometimes they did not exist at all. This body of law institutionalized a number of economic, educational, and social disadvantages. De jure segregation existed mainly in the Southern states, while Northern segregation was generally de facto—patterns of housing segregation enforced by private covenants, bank lending practices, and job discrimination, including discriminatory labor union practices. Jim Crow was a pejorative expression meaning Negro.\n\n\n\n\nJim Crow laws—sometimes, as in Florida, part of state constitutions—mandated the segregation of public schools, public places, and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms, restaurants, and drinking fountains for whites and blacks. The U.S. military was already segregated. President Woodrow Wilson, a Southerner, initiated segregation of federal workplaces at the request of southern Cabinet members in 1913.\n\n\n\n\nThese Jim Crow laws revived principles of the 1865 and 1866 Black Codes, which had previously restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans. Segregation of public (state-sponsored) schools was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education. In some states it took years to implement this decision. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but years of action and court challenges have been needed to unravel the many means of institutional discrimination."
17694,"I thought it was hilarious😆"	
17695,"Sorry just because your ass in under fire..."	
17696,"Pewdiepie, you are so down to earth and reasonable dude. I can't think of any other famous person that I feel like I could sit down for a drink and speak to like I speak to any friend. I'm sure if someone doesn't recognise you out there you wouldn't feel any weird to talk to and you surely wouldn't ever go out screaming it at their face that your famous. That's just not the image I get from watching your videos. Keep being cool."	
17697,"Don't say the N word. Please."	
17698,"You seem pretty right wing and unhinged these days...  Dude, just chill and stop watching FOX news for a while.  Sure PC is annoying.  But going all right wing is going to fuck up your life.  Pretty soon you'll be extolling the virtues of the Aryan race, denying climate science, jumping off the deep end.  In 20 years when even the retards accept climate science and the pretty consistent trend towards increasing empathy towards people different than you plays forwards you'll seem like you were on the wrong side of history."

The extremely well-paid clown goes out and makes fun of hard working Americans, most of whom are poor and uneducated, simply because of their political beliefs? And then he tries to makes it seem like THEY are the ones who are messed up in the head? I mean, not everybody can have daddy pay their way through college and for study abroad trips in Europe like Jordan Klepper had growing up. Some people had to quit high school at 16 and work the family business, scraping by only to have their entire world crumble because their insurance went up 60% from Obamacare. \n\nBut that's okay. Rich little clown boy can just go on making fun of everyday Americans. Enjoy another 4 years of Trump in 2020, morons. Keep mocking the blue collar people and make all your rich socialite friends giggle. The rest of the country will keep on rejecting you. Seriously, what utter rubbish this is.

No but actually if we actually stopped yelling at each other we might be able to start repairing things and maybe by some miracle start figuring what are the actual 'plain facts'\n\nBut everyone knows that WE'RE right!!!1!!!\nThats what the other side says too\n\nBut haven't you seen videos of (Insert generic group) on (insert non sponsered video site here), they are just morons who don't even know politics, all of them!!\nA real answer to this one. After being through more than my share of counseling and therapy I can say this is one of what they call a Cognitive distortions. It's what happens when someone has a bad experience with one person, interaction or thing and associates that bad thing with the entire population. This can cause major problems if lets say someone gets rescued from the sex slave after being abused by a bunch of men, and after that they are deathly afraid of any grown man because they associate grown men with fear. Oh wait you don't struggle with trauma after one bad experience from a person of a political party! WELL THEN WHY ARE YOU MAKING GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT ONE ENTIRE POLITICAL PARTY BASED ON ONE MORONS WORDS OR ACTION"

Until now, so without the button we have swipe down from the top, swipe up, swipe down from the right, swipe down from the middle, and swipe halfway up.

18345,"You ignored Boo Radley. That's why."	
18346,"To be honest all i got out of this vid was a newfound appreciation for paperback books."	
18347,"I disagree. To Kill a Mockingbird was the first book in my 20s. I didn't read in high school and picked up the book while wondering an airport bookstore. Much to my surprise the imagery created in the book got me hooked to reading. I try to read everyday and I'd like to think TKAM had a lot to do with it. Kind of like if you try something for the first time and you like it, you're more likely to do it again. Great story, holds over time. I'll have to read it again to see if the meaning has changed for me."

18349,"the book is NOT overrated."	
18350,"I hated this book. It is overrated."	
18351,"What a cheap stunt by Vox to take an american masterpiece like Mockingbird and call it overrated. My guess is all the people agreeing with the sentiment probably haven't read it since school.

18357,"the book is so popular that i'm pretty sure there is two copies of it in my family house and no one in that house reads, on top of that it was the one school assignment i missed but seen the movie for :D"	
18358,"...600% better than [the books you read zero times]? What's 600% of 0? Smh.. If you read the books proportionately to how good they are then TKAM would have been infinitely better than the others (even at 1 read). Prob should have mixed in an algebra book"	
18359,"So it's so famous bc of paperbacks???!"

18375,"Yeah, i never *had* to read it for school, but I read it for fun in 5th grade, but I had to read a bunch of other books that perhaps don't have as much social importance/literary quality. So for me, is the book 1000%+ underrated? I'm just saying the logic in the beginning of this video doesn't really make sense."	
18376,"I only read it because I had the chance."	
18377,"And it was certainly not a new theme. A better story was Daniel White, For the Greater Good, by Harlan Ellison. A black kid rapes a white girl, has no remorse, and the black civil rights leaders give him over to a lynch mob to become a martyr for the Greater good of their cause."

18385,"Eh... perhaps Penguim books contributed to part of it's success, but the argument simply doesn't hold water by itself.\nThere are some key factors in To Kill a Mocking Bird that several literary staples and cases of explosive success and endurance also usually have:\n\nA somewhat subversive style for the time. As in, uncommon type of literature that took some by surprise.\nAlso subversive ideas. Exploration of taboo and controversial themes.\nUsually a fresh take on a theme.\nPortrait of a given era that people might not be quite familiar with - microcosm exploration.\nCloseness to the authors' own raw, potential scandalous stories, sometimes drawing controversies after publication, sometimes not so much.\nSimple writting, easy to follow, easy to understand.\nA somewhat realistic style, often coming with a bit of grittiness to it.\nNot following a mainstream or conventional structure - monomyth, clear moral lessons, etc.\n(optional) Realistic and raw coming of age story, reality crash, or a complete change of perspective and opinion. Critical reasoning put to test.\nThe common people in extraordinary circunstances thing.\nAll of those might be realized right after publication, up to years after the author has already died... matter of perception of the time it exploded in popularity.\n\nA whole bunch of literary classics follow some of these, when not all of these. Kerouac's On the Road, Sallinger's Catcher in the Rye, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Palahniuk's Fight Club, Capote's In Cold Blood... to name a few.\n\nSee that I'm not criticising the works for following a certain structure nor trying to diminish the works because they have common characteristics... rather, I love them all and think they deserve the success."	
18386,"Back in the day they really liked to emphasize women's nipples, didn't they?"	
18387,"Thought this book was gonna be about Go Set a Watchman and how that book was the original draft of To Kill A Mockingbird. GSAW takes the story of TKAM and flips it on its head, and it is so very underrated compared to TKAM."	
18388,"fantastic. so ready for more."	
18389,"If you're going to cover an overrated mid-century American paperback ubiquitous in public schools, cover _The Catcher in the Rye_ .\nI mean, it was good, but geez."	
18390,"To be honest I think The Secret Life of Bees was a much better book that touched all the same values. This book just made me cry. Not that TSLOB didn't, but...I found it more relatable and I feel like I really learned something from it."	
18391,"TBH, I'd rather to kill a mockingbird rather than read bless me ultima again for English class"	
18392,"I actually never read how to kill a mocking bird..."

18394,"If you are not hypnotized by the awesome graphics, skip to the reason, somewhere around 3:22."	
18395,"I think it's because teachers are lazy and fail to update their curriculums and lesson plans. There are countless worksheets and assignments from my high school dated from the 80s and 90s"

18410,"guess im not the only one that thought it was overrated."	
18411,"If your looking for a interesting and (I guess) grounded explanation for how books such as To Kill a Mockingbird become a sensation I recommend the The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell."	
18412,"Never read this in school. Found it at my grandparents house when I was 9. This IS my favorite book. It's well written and takes you to that time and that place like no other story I've read. Sorry, in my mind your just slightly over rated. Like love, it's all in the eyes of the beholder."	
18413,"no... the catcher in the rye is the worst book thought in school"	
18414,"This video explains how it was lucky to get popular, but that doesn't make it overrated"

18576,"Honestly... I am. Well, I am kind of skeptical. The Disaster Artist is probably my favourite book of the 2010's thus far, however I find Seth Rogen and James Franco to be lack lister actors with the exception of Freaks & Geeks. Franco's inflections and mannerism (from this admittedly short preview) are at times very Wiseau-like while others seem so far removed from Tommy it is off-putting. However, I am usually skeptical regarding things I am very fond of, so I am still excited despite my concerns.\n\nI will say I am more excited for Best F(r)iends and the possible small part Tommy plays in this movie. 😉"

18583,"This film is going to bring Tommy Wiseau full circle.  A man with a vision of being famous and recognized for his craft.  Fails miserably in his own movie.  Movie becomes cult phenomenon.  Cult film inspires real Hollywood film.  Actor portraying Tommy wins oscar for his role in a memorable performance of ineptitude.  Man is therefore recognized for his craft."

18600,"James Franco was BORN to play Tommy Wiseau"	
18601,"Man... I'm speechless, Dave's performance as Tommy Wiseau is really making me feel for the guy.\nThat scene in the trailer where they are in the movie theater and everybody is laughing at his movie like it's a comedy even though its supposed to be a serious drama, hits you right in the feels."

18629,"Love the concept, but honestly James Franco doesn't do a good Tommy impression at all (Granted TW in real has a fucked voice so you can only get so close, but this guy sounds nothing like him). Also Seth Rogen hasn't been funny since Pineapple Express. It'll still be good, but I guess we still have to just watch The Room to get the full Tommy Wiseau experience haha.\n\nEdit: Spelling"

Im currently on my way back to Florida, I don't know what to expect. I tried to contact neighbors to see what's going on in my region but had no luck reaching them. Im scared of going back to a completely destroyed home. Not to mention that power is still off for millions of people.

Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others don’t? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities?"

I feel bad for the world but today I especially feel bad for those victims. God bless them and protect them."

Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues."

It doesn't matter what they do, people will always say they do it for free promotion or some sht, but maybe they geniunly wanted to help.

18771,"He deserved it to be in the finals but he didnt come through :("	
18772,"This guy is just the kind of person that I liked the most"	
18773,"I love how everyone's trying to expose this guy but it really doesn't matter lol."	
18774,"i feel he had a rigged tweet card, and used some slight of hand to switch them. As of getting her to pick that tweet is easy."	
18775,"The part that convinces me is his undercover work when nobody recognizes him--except everyone in the audience. This is the phoniest mentalist routine I have ever seen on television."	
18776,"I must say the way of Colin's presentation is not that good. That must be the reason for which he couldn't be finalist. I personally expected much better from him.\nBtw he can watch Lior Suchard videos on youtube :)"	
18777,"I really don't understand why people like this guy. Nothing about him interests me."	
18778,"Nobody will EVER top this. This is enough to win AGT"	
18779,"His math is wrong though. It wouldn't be 43 quadrillion combinations it'd be more like 1 quadrillion or 900 billion"	
18780,"3:06 he distracts her by asking her to stand, and puts the tweet sticker on the paper. Then forces the choice of tweet stopping his finger on the right one, then switches the entire sheet of paper over afterwards to allowed scrutiny"	
18781,"I'm so sad he got eliminated but I'm happy that this was his last performance. What an Exit"	
18782,"Heidi looks absolutely amazing. Mel on the other hand... is looks like Guy Diamond farted on her."	
18783,"How did he lose?"	
18784,"That reminds me of now you see me, the part of the bank"	
18785,"The dog act though"	
18786,"you all have it wrong.  when mel b hands him the card he takes it with his left hand and places a sticker on the card with his right hand. watch closely 3:00"	
18787,"Ha..how...how you doing that? *peter griffin voice*"	
18788,"He is the best"	
18789,"HE HAS TO WIN."	
18790,"Since he is so good at predicting what will happen, why was he asking for support on Twitter?  He should have known that none of the judges would be on his side.  \nRegardless, he should have been in the finals."	
18791,"I always don't like Say Stop things"	
18792,"He's wearing a Steve ricks tailored Matt smith coat😂"	
18793,"I think people needed to stop and think. LOOK AT WHAT THIS GUY CAN DO! I love Kechi I think she's sweet but there are better singers. Colin on the other hand is crazy!!! He definitely should've gotten through."	
18794,"Jesus Effing Christ, how can people be so predictable with naming a city? Can't it be Krakow, Sarajevo, Sofia, or Belgrade or something."	
18795,"Did he predict that he is KO."	
18796,"It works like this \n1. Show off the phrase, numbers, or words without the victim or audience realizing\n2. Have the card with the thing from part 1 close by so it has a higher chance to be picked\n3. Now that it has subliminally been put into their minds they will be even more likely to pick that tweet or whatever it would be.\n4. Realize this is a old trick Redon, but still is amazing because it will not always work"	
18797,"I swear on everything this nigga is a legend"	
18798,"Everyone knows there is no such thing as magic, so this was purely meant to astonish and entertain. I'm pretty sure I know how he pulled this off, but more impressive is how he involved not only the audience, but even the judges. And he managed to pull it off where, without the magic of being able to play this over and over on YouTube, everyone was in awe.\nEnjoy it for what it was."	
18799,"Too bad a singer with a tragic backstory is gonna win because that's what people vote for these days"	
18800,"Wtf is happening with Mel's hair"	
18801,"I don't know if this is cool or creepy.  Either way,  I'm amazingly impressed!"	
18802,"Can someone tell me why both America and the judges were so stupid? The 5 should've been Mandy, Christian, Merrick, Colin, and Kechi. And if not one of those then Angelica. But nope they voted for a light show act instead and the judges chose a weird dance play thing over Colin. I'm just done."	
18803,"when he asked for a city, I would have expected everyone to put England."	
18804,"The only thing amazing about this guy is that he would leave the house with that embarrassing of a haircut."	
18805,"Is it just me or does Mel B always look perfect"	
18806,"The guy below me is stupid as hell"	
18807,"GOOD EVENING AMERICA ARE YOU WELL?\nYEAHHH!!\nGatis Kandis: No they're not a well, they're a PEOPLE!"	
18808,"NO RIP COLIN IN THE FINALS CRI"	
18809,"I am so mad that he didn't make it threw! America wanted him more. The votes were high for him during the dunkin save. Divalo was good, but Colin was amazing!"	
18810,"Dear Colin's,I am so sorry you didn't get through I was really upset when I saw the results. And I think you should have gone on instead of Diavalo.. Magic like yours doesn't come very often. You are a AMAZING person with so many great personalitys. I ❤️ You!"	
18811,"This was amazing! how did he not go through"	
18812,"So he saw movie FOCUS .\nSo did we."	
18813,"his trick seems like what will smith did in the movie focus !"	
18814,"Pause at 1:43 read upside down"	
18815,"OMG"	
18816,"omg he's a real live horseman.. #nowyouseeme"	
18817,"Stupid hair"	
18818,"Fake"

18821,"Colin was robbed. 🤨"	
18822,"This is insane"	
18823,"HOW SWAY?!?"	
18824,"Demonic"	
18825,"Hey guys Ali-A here"	
18826,"Colin Clout*"

18828,"Tweets on Sheets.\nRhyme time."	
18829,"fantastic"	
18830,"EVILLLLL"	
18831,"Holy dickballs"	
18832,"FAKE FAKE FAKE, when he asked Heidi to say stop, he put the choices on the card that he wanted. Check the video in slow motion and you can see him move his left thumb to put the right tweets on the card.  WATCH IT IN SLOW MOTION, REALLY"	
18833,"Riverdale has become the biggest and best thing CW has done!! 😍👏\n\n\nP.s. YES I WATCH ARROW, FLASH, THE ORIGINALS, THE 100, ETC.... I love alllllll of them.... just expressing my love for this show...."	
18834,"DID BUGHEAD JUST HAVE A FUCKING RAIN KISS COS BITCH IM"	
18835,"I SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO can't wait!!! I love 'Riverdale' to the core."	
18836,"Bughead!! \nCan't wait anymore"	
18837,"The song used in the promo is Lykke Li - Window Blues. You're welcome! :)"	
18838,"VARCHIE IN THE SHOWER IM SHOCKED EVEN THOUGH IM A BARCHIE SHIPPER"	
18839,"WE GOT A FUCKING RAIN KISS SJSKJSKJSD"	
18840,"None of Y'all seem to have noticed Hiram looking sinister as fuck... fuck all the ships we got Hispanic Tony Montana and a bleeding Joaquin. \nWhy none of you care about my boy Joaquin???"	
18841,"Riverdale is one of my favorite shows of all time!!"	
18842,"OMG VARCHIE SHOWER SCENEE!!!"	
18843,"I don't know if I'm the only one who thinks that way but I feel that the trailers are getting better and better. Like the first one they showed at Comic Con was a bit meh and veeeeery dramatic. This one, on the other hand, is a lot more interesting and brings more depth to what we could expect out of this season. And the cinematography seems to have changed (maybe because the writers have been saying that this season is going to be darker).\nI hope Hiram's character will be as interesting as the trailer shows, and that the main characters will grow in depth. So far, looks positive!"	
18844,"If Fred Andrews dies we riot"	
18845,"Bughead is endgame, bye :)"

18863,"At 0:18 I think it might be the coopers going to see fp"	
18864,"The wedding is a dream because people saw the shooter pull a gun out on set or maybe he wants to shoot Archie but I think it's the former"

18932,"HES BRITISH ??!!??!!??"	
18933,"Nicki's a tired act now. Should've got *Amber Rose.* For just the video I mean. Amber behind the wheel of a slick ride should be the expected sort of scantily clad female eye candy in these sexy types of music videos."	
18934,"Did she name drop Seth rogan as Seth ro?"	
18935,"Hello guys I just wanted to say that I do song covers on my channel, in case you're interested…I'm having some issues right now, but I will get back on track soon, hopefully…Sorry for the self-promotion, when you're a small channel it's pretty hard getting your content out there…Thank you from Italy :) <3"

18940,"nicki's verse should put in when the song is about to end like 2 verse before so this song is not boring eitherway, well done tho"	
18941,"I'll be honest, though I love both artists, this song has some weird pacing issues and doesn't seem that radio friendly"	
18942,"This song makes me feel like I’m a somebody"	
18943,"Is there a song where nicki is not featuring?"	
18944,"Love it. Fergie gets down like herself. She isn't TRYING TO BE BLACK when she raps. She always had a funky flow."	
18945,"Can I get some likes for no reason"

18958,"I see this song in the background of tv commercials like target/jcpenny"	
18959,"Probably the most appropriate thing Nikki has everrr worn 😂"	
18960,"That little pat she did at 1:51 with that face KILLED me"	
18961,"GARBAGE!!!!! another mid 2000 artist that flops nasty....Internet wins again ur industry is dying"

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to see *a* puppetry channel get some mass exposure, but I *have* seen better channels with better puppetry (some of them even lip sync properly)."

19234,"as chris smoove would say: melo got hit with the cheese XD or i would expect stephen a to say whoever made this list had to be drug tested or so high or something XD and no wonder y i enjoyed watching tnt nba games over espn because of that X("	
19235,"i would not take carmelo anthony on any team.. HE IS NOT A TEAM PLAYER! can he score, yes. does he play defense, kinda. but when you pass the ball to melo its a black hole, you're never getting the ball back, he doesn't make ANY team better by being on the starting roster....the bench yes...starting, no"	
19236,"What do you expect?  These casual fans think one demonsional players are MVP candidates."	
19237,"ESPN is high again."	
19238,"I agree with ESPN's list and yes, I don't know shit about basketball."	
19239,"hes speaking facts but is it only me or he reminds you of lavar ball"	
19240,"Melo top 20 I'll give him 15"	
19241,"Glad Stephen A got onto something that is absolute crud."	
19242,"Tell me what the 63 people ahead of Melo can do with THESE Knicks? I'll wait....and don't tell me the obvious we know that Westbrook, LeBron, Harden, etc can do wonders but Eric Gordon? Danny Green? Harrison Barnes? If they are better than Melo what can they do with THESE Knicks? I just wanna know"	
19243,"First of all wade ain't even in the top 100 mf averaged almost 20 a game n demar 38 headscratcher"	
19244,"Stephen A. Smith a GOD"	
19245,"Lol..one is an all star and one averages 7 points per game.....i have no idea who is better someone tell me"	
19246,"Carmelo is in the top 25 I can say that with confidence. Put some RESPEK on that man name lol"	
19247,"How the fuck is DeRozan ranked 36th after averaging 27, 5, and 4? This shit is a joke and everyone who made and let this article come through should be immediately fired."	
19248,"Kobe my nigga. He said the same about him and look how it turn out"	
19249,"Caermello is not elite Stephen a has to admit that now that being said carmello ain't no 64th lmao that's blasphemy he's probably 15 or 16 in my mind but that's his fault nobody respects him because we know he don't care about the game he just about money so oh well"	
19250,"Myles Turner got a better ranking than Carmelo AND Demar DeRozan. LIKE WHAT?"	
19251,"I know 1 thing the HOF is b.s Reggie Mitch t Mac B . king yao.  the list goes on . if u don't a mvp or a chip rookie year award or any award u should be in the HOF .its disrespectful to Mj bird wilt many other player that give a 100% every nite . \nDon't tell no gold metal that a give way .we all know a all star team playing again the world . BS"	
19252,"Carmelo has to go play with a true point guard or LeBron James ."	
19253,"+50 points for using the word Moribund"	
19254,"how come no one talking about the slight possibility that ESPN does this shit for content? not taking credit but i forget where i read it, but it makes somewhat sense. ESPN comes up with bs list which then creates reactions from the channel itself thus creating content to talk about. rinse and repeat"	
19255,"Claims to be a prolific scorer but is in the low 20s...  That's good but to say omg he is a prolific scorer?  Gtfo"	
19256,"Melon is still a top 20 player easy!!"	
19257,"Carmelo is garbage and has been garbage"	
19258,"Melo is top 10 wtf are they talking about? Lol 😂"	
19259,"Lonzo hasn't played a fucking min. In the regular season of the NBA 😂😂😂 that shit is hilarious"	
19260,"I must say this is the only thing i agree strongly with sas."	
19261,"Stephen A gets all ass hurt when people go after his butt buddies but then talk all the shit he wants about Dez and other guys who are far more talented than Carmelo fuckin Anthony.  That Puerto Rican trash is trash"	
19262,"It's time to give up the ghost. Shave that head."	
19263,"This might be the first time where i totally, 100%, without a doubt, absolutely agree with him.  right on SAS"	
19264,"ESPN has become garbage. This poll accurately represents them.  They just all political and about popularity now."	
19265,"definitely top 20. Whoever did the ranking at ESPN is stupid"	
19266,"Stephen A made the same mistake he blasted them for ranking Kobe lower at the end of his career, which they turned out to be right about.  People like Stephen A continue to think of these guys like they were in their prime. Carmelo has been in a steady decline the past 4 years, having his worst year last year since he came into the league.   While putting Lonzo Ball ahead of him is a joke, there's little argument he is outside the top 50 now."	
19267,"Stop making excuses for Carmelo SAS!! Now I get he doesn't play defense, fair enough. But when you carry all the weight on offense you tend to slack off on defense. That's why Carmelo should not be considered a superstar. Somewhere along the lines he fell into the superstar category awhile back. He's great on offense. Maybe that's why? But he is the Jay Cutler of the NBA by SAS standards. All the talent, weapon on offense, but doesn't make anyone better and can't lead a team. Carmelo should be a solid #3 option to depend. A kevin love all star. He shines in Olympic competition because he has other superstars that need to be guarded and competition is weaker. \n\nI don't care about the ranking. Let's talk about the player."	
19268,"There are not 20 players i would take  before Melo."	
19269,"At least top 20 come on 64?"	
19270,"ESPN be covering to much politics to give a damn about sports!"	
19271,"Shut up Stephen A, you're the one who knows nothing about basketball. Your last 6 NBA championship predictions ended with you picking the wrong winner. You are biased. Carmelo is not great, he destroys team chemistry, he fires coaches, and he is a ballhog who can't win."	
19272,"The only reason Melo is being rank so low is because he black."	
19273,"Lonzo tho?not hating but lonzo is not even the best in his draft class but he's better than melo smh espn"	
19274,"I was tryna hear what max was gonna say smh"	
19275,"64 😂 disrespectful , do y'all  even watch him play ball !?"	
19276,"Add Lebron James to that list of players who will average +20 PPG for 15 straight seasons."	
19277,"Steve you a 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000% Right......."	
19278,"This is why y'all are losing ratings...dummies"	
19279,"Carmelo fucking sucks. He's only relevant because he's tied to LeBron. He has literally had an average career, never led his team to anywhere remotely decent as in early playoff rounds. Fact is he sucks."	
19280,"carmelo anthony should be in the low 300's"	
19281,"Lonzo Ball going be a Bum An the NBA"	
19282,"Top 40.. the difference between melon and Danny green is the green plays d.. defense is a big part of the game.  Melon has been over rated his whole career.. he is a star but never truly a super Star of the league."	
19283,"Fuck espn that's why FOX sports is so better now"	
19284,"First Wade and Howard aren’t even in the top 100, then this. Analytics isn’t everything."	
19285,"ESPN on Crack lol that Young nigga not better than Melo"	
19286,"Lonzo Ball was ranked ahead of Melo lol"	
19287,"This is why ESPN is garbage..."	
19288,"Say what you want about Melo, but he's a prolific scorer who's going to be in the hall of fame.  To put a 19 year old who's never played a game in front of him is ridiculous.  That ESPN Rank lost all credibility."	
19289,"That Steven guy is full of belligerent hot air."	
19290,"its funny how they fall right into the trap. nobody would give a fuck about this list if they put people in the right order. they put lonzo ahead of melo 1 spot ahead literally just to make these guys talk about it"	
19291,"If ESPN analyst | experts are going to vote in a pole they need to attach their name and number so we can track their lack of credability."	
19292,"#FireStephenA , this guy has nut hugged crapello since day one, I believe they are even buddies. When has crapello played team basketball? When has he put his team in a position to win? He's a ball hog, with no sense of basketball knowledge, he's a greedy egocentric scrub, who has no business in the NBA. He should have been let go years ago. He's the second biggest cancer to their team only behind leflop james, get rid of crapello anthony and let the Knicks move forward. It's pathetic to see this garbage ass overrated crybaby get his huge contracts, when he can't even get past round one of the playoffs. Obviously every team he's played for while losing had one thing in common. Crapello anthony."	
19293,"Wow espn needs to back to school just dumb just dump lol"	
19294,"Melo is at least a top 20 player in the NBA,only 1 of 4 players to average 20 ppg through his entire career (LeBron,Kd,Jordan and Melo)"	
19295,"The word disrespectful doesn't even cut it. It's not disrespect. It's straight up non-factual. You can disrespect Melo all you want, but saying a rookie who has never played a single NBA game is better than a player who's been the franchise player for two teams? That's straight up idiotic garbage."	
19296,"I'd give him a rank of 150. He can't play any d. Basketball has offense AND DEFENSE, not just one on one ball hog offense."	
19297,"I hate people saying atleast have Melo in the top 35-40 that stupid shit right there is disrespectful as well, Melo is easily a top 20 player In the NBA. Get the fuck out of here you haters he was averaging 24 7 and 3 and was in playoff coversation before the injuries of Kristaps Porzingis and the lazy defense from the team, And Melo ended up averaging 23 6 and 3 either way, And is one of the clutchest players in the NBA, and of all time. If this list was a all time rank, 64 would be still pretty disrespectful for Melo, let alone a today list"	
19298,"WOW, THAT RANKING IS GROUNDS FOR DEATH TO WHOMEVER CONSTRUCTED IT. Lonzo ball is not better than Jusuf Nurkic yet alone..... CARMELO!  NURKIC went 28pts/20reb/8ast/6blk last season with the Blazers. And after the Denver trade averaged 15pts/10reb/1.3stl/1.9blk over 20 games with his new team. That stat line hasnt been posted since CHARLES BARKLEY in 1986.  Jusuf is a top-10 center already in the NBA based on what he HAS DONE. HES DONE IT. LONZO HASNT DONE JACK. Rankings beyond wack."	
19299,"Let whoever made the list play hoodie melo 1v1"	
19300,"ESPN make shit up so Stephen A can talk about it."	
19301,"I clicked this video because I thought the guy on the thumbnail was a black nicolas cage."

19367,"It's looks nice, but I'm not paying 1k for a phone, unless it has some expensive materials or its bulletproof"	
19368,"What about the Major Face ID Unlock FAIL ???"	
19369,"If that iPhone doesn't have Siri Im going to freak out"	
19370,"I liked upgrading ever other generation of iPhone and can see holding onto my 6s. My 2 year old 6s still works great and the battery last like it did new... You can pay more but just not get more with X. A thousand dollars ($1000.00) worth of broke glass front and back is what I like the most, so cool stereo broke glass. #MAGA make apple great again"	
19371,"Can someone explain when they say wireless charging when you still have to plug the compartment in just like a charger"

19380,"what i like about the Iphone X is the gorgeous 5.8 OLED Dispaly 😍. would love to win the giveaway"	
19381,"I've been waiting for your review!! 👌🏾never disappoints"	
19382,"Well to me it's seems nice enough upgrade from any other iPhone for sure but I think the home button will be missed dearly and the swiping thing might be hard to adapt especially if u r used to changing phones a lot. What u say?"	
19383,"I think they should have a thin line along the rim like the on button for the home button"	
19384,"Wait. The wireless charging is available for all iphones?"	
19385,"That's a sleek ass looking phone. I'm still going to get my note 8 though."

19390,"This guy is so handsome 😍"	
19391,"Face recognition has been on android for ages. what Samsung pushed with The note 7 s8 and note 8 was iris scan (better than face ID)"	
19392,"Nice phone but $1000?  Let's also talk about their latest renovation of Samsung screen and wireless charging."	
19393,"its 2017 and i'm Still Rocking my iPhone 4s!"

19396,"I'm gonna use my kidney on the pixel 2 instead..."	
19397,"Watch somebody drop it the first day they buy it"	
19398,"Personal favorite feature has to be the screen, Apple doesn't do poor quality screens... can't wait to see it in person."	
19399,"Did Apple say why did change the camera from horizontal to vertical? What do you think?"	
19400,"I'm still running on an iPhone 5.... Still all these android mfs come here every time a new iPhone comes...if Apple sucks so bad why are they still making money gtfo of here with all that crap. Its not like Tim cooks gonna listen to all the fucking Android fans...what I'm trynna say FUCK OFF! 😂"	
19401,"I don't know If I want it or not might just get a s8"	
19402,"Do iphone x and iphone 8 have have audio jack?"	
19403,"All this people talking about the price! If you can't afford the phone don't buy it simple as that! How about all those droid users criticizing the iPhone X! Go and watch Droid videos! Most of these users have never touched an iPhone but yet criticize Apple! Gosh!"	
19404,"Face id is what concerns me most. That demo snafu by Craig made me think that perhaps the software isn't there yet."

19406,"Started watching. Stopped. Want to see the phone in action, not you yappin' and flappin'. Definitely not subscribing."	
19407,"The best feature is wireless charging because if Apple does it, then it will become a huge necessity for everyone to tow the line (even though The Simpsons did it first)."	
19408,"When you take a screenshot is the result perfectly rectangular or does it have those funny ears on the top edge with the selfie camera bezel cutout blank displayed in the screenshot?"	
19409,"Face ID and Wireless charging is very impressive"	
19410,"Specs on the iPhone 8 Plus are near identical to that of the 7 Plus. That’s with exception to the new processor etc etc. The camera specs are the same yet 7 Plus users see a software block where they can’t use the portrait lighting mode on a phone that has the same camera capabilities as the new one. That is one main reason I don’t like Apple locking customers out of older products and pushing them into new"	
19411,"My favorite feature is the new design and how the software works with it"	
19412,"This is Apple Xpensive....!"	
19413,"The iphone x seems to just play catch up with samsung , but in a nicer package than samsung experience"

19420,"$999. Ha. I remember the Motorola StarTac coming out a dollar more at $1,000. That was a groundbreaking phone. This doesn't seem so. Though I'm sure it'll be $299 with a plan in short time."

19439,"Instead of a universe with 30s horror I want to see a universe with modern horror icons like Jason, Michael Myers, Ash, Freddy, etc. etc. That'd be cool."	
19440,"I forgot about that detail about the trailer!! It's still hilarious! \nSo glad I didn't see this film. \nThanks for another great video Screen Junkies :)"	
19441,"they're gonna ruin my childhood with the new jumanji reboot too, won't they?"

Imo it wasn't cute or funny, it honestly made me uncomfortable how unprofessional he was being by running his hands ALL over her w/o her consent. She genuinely seemed upset by the middle, and think she should definitely report him, or at least notify hiring manager that he should be given a warning regarding behavior. I mean, the difference in personal space and choreo between him and the other male dancers is astounding... He was 100% crossing the line, no question about it.

19975,"WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?"	
19976,"I... have to go and rethink life now."	
19977,"There is no entanglement. Photons just don't experience time so when one filter changes the polarity of the entangled photon, it changes it throughout the entire existence of the photon."	
19978,"Probably missing the point entirely, but what if the blocked sunlight is instead reflected/repolarized, such that some light is passing through at the requisite angle, because it forces it to, so at each filter it's effectively a 45 degree offset instead of a full 90 degree.\n\nAnd since one of the entangled pair is being offset by this smaller amount, it also forces the other to be offset as well.\n\nEDIT: OK, I guess you did mention a hidden variable being influenced by the filter.\n\nLocality I'm willing to say might be upended in certain circumstances. Same with realism. I also have no scientific argument to support my claim. Just one that seems to sound logically sound."	
19979,"I really don't think that this kind of information is suitable for the lay public.\n\nMy education is in economics, so I'm comfortable talking both statistics and (most) other mathematics. But every time I see something about quantum entanglement/the double slit/etc, I just see a series of what I can describe as poorly designed experiments that (appear) to rely on unproven assumptions and build upon them. Clearly, they are not poorly designed	 experts far more educated on the subject matter are doing them. The only thing I've really learned is that I have not been given even the basic information needed to understand let alone make a judgement about it. \n\nIt does make me concerned, especially when the information is given to the scientifically illiterate general public (one glance through this videos comments and you'll run into a deluge of pseudo-scientific babble). The reality is that information given to people without knowledge is dangerous (even if that's only in giving a false sense of understanding). Until the research is more definitive, this information seems to be best kept with the experts, however passionate they may be sharing the information with content creators and the general public."
19980,"how do you measure how much light remains after it passes through the last filter? what if that measurement would also work like a filter, then we also got the human eye that filters and the mind behind it, probably making a big thing out of something not really special or paradoxical at all."	
19981,"Wasn't it proven that there isn't any hidden information/variable?"	
19982,"I think you should look at the shape of the sin wave. \n\nOdd example. Antifreeze poisoning. I know i know hold on. The cure for anti freeze poisoning is vodka. Lots and lots of alcohol. Why? Because your body will process the antifreeze as if it were vodka based on the shape of the two molecules. \nSo if a sin wave is within that 15 percent range it will probably pass through the polarizer because it looks similar enough. \nI could be wrong but didnt some scientist show that light has memory. Passing two seperate light sources through a crystal turning one light source off but the crystal still projected the same image.\nCould light essentially squeeze through modifing the path of the photon?\n\nAlso i would reverse your perspective on the situation. What does the light look like from polerizer c's view. The path the sin wave (photon) travels from a and from a+b would be different. \nJust a late night cant sleep thought."	
19983,"1:47 another video setting unrealistic standards for stick figures."	
19984,"A thought I had is if the particles somehow could store their choices, and entangled particles have the same stored choices, then they would behave the same way without having to interact above the speed of light"

19986,"People who watched this video might also be interested in following two experiments that relates heavily to this topic:\nQuantum eraser - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment\nDelayed choice quantum eraser - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser\n\nIt would be cool if you could make a video about this or more QM overall."	
19987,"... you spent 14 minutes talking about how it can't work one way. You mention offhand in the middle that that suggests it must work a second way.... And then never mention that second way again. This video would have felt a lot more meaningful if you spent some time talking about other ways it might work instead of only talking about this one way it can't possibly work."	
19988,"Why must the variable be in the photons, and not the lenses?"	
19989,"Would phase change have anything to do with this? Can the filters change the frequency of light, making UV and IR into visible?\n Maybe there's some quantum property that we don't yet know of."

19993,"I fixed the experiment! 👍\n\nA photon flying through a filter has a chance to pass through it even if it's not quite parallel.\nThis chance falls off exponentially as the difference in angle increases, up to 90° where there is a 0% chance.\n*As the photon passes through it rotates to match the angle of polarisation of the filter.*\n\nI'm sure there's some basic reason why this is wrong, it just seemed like a really obvious solution to me haha. I would really like to know why. 😀"

19997,"My head can't handle this 😵"	
19998,"This is a misunderstanding of Bell's theorem, Bell himself said it doesn't prohibit hidden variables, just LOCAL hidden variables... the wave function is global, and perfectly capable of holding values that keep things deterministic rather than probabilistic. So no, the deterministic universe has not been disproven."	
19999,"It was good if you mention that in classical view this effect is not weird at all. http://alienryderflex.com/polarizer/"

20001,"I bet the numbers change to 100	75
20002,"Why is it that locality is such a hardcore rule!!?? I mean consider quantum mechanical movement like pressure of water jet in a tunnel, a right angle direction change makes a substantial loss of pressure to heat but a directional change less than right angle can re-align the pressure in direction of movement. I mean old toilet pipes were semicircular loop and not perfect right angled to optimize water pressure through suction."

20007,"has it possible that process of passing through the second filter alters the nature of those photons to make them brighter or change how they interact with additional filters?"	
20008,"Time doesn't exist and there is only one photon..."	
20009,"Why talk on hidden variables instead of the paradox? Made the presentation pretty muddled"	
20010,"I thought adding a third linear polarization filter at something other than 90° basically converted a portion of the light polarization to circular. The cosine of the angle of the middle filter then describes the percentage of light that will pass through the the third filter."

20026,"Oh hey look, it's the theory of everything! https://www.facebook.com/superrelativity/"	
20027,"This seems kinda obvious to me. Light is waves and you are filtering light through slits. There will be interference patterns. You also have to take into consideration how big are the slits. If you filter horizontal reflections, waves won't be perfectly vertical. There will be a little bit of play! That's why when you introduce a third slit in between, the photons that bounced on the edges on the in between slit will have different polarization from the first one, thus it will pass through the third one... That's why when you rotate only 2 filters there is 2 positions that will block the light. But when you have 3 filters there is 4 position that will block the light."	
20028,"Especially loved the conversation at the end, really added to the whole collab and friendly feel to the video!"	
20029,"Then the answer is clear, the photon passes but not seen or change it form from lens to lens."

20033,"You're assuming that the ability to pass through the filters happen simultaneously. Obviously having glasses and having a beard can happen simultaneously, but passing through filters happens chronologically. It can't pass through two at the same time without both filters being the same object. Your analogy is faulty and therefore you can't use the same math to describe both situations"	
20034,"What if entanglement really means that in other dimensions the entangled particles are local, thus speed of  light is not violated."	
20035,"It's because reality is just a projection of two dimensional data at the advancing wave of the original Big Bang."	
20036,"So if we got 90 lenses and rotated each .1 degrees from the last, how much would get through?"	
20037,"I feel like a total dunce.."	
20038,"Your best video in ages."	
20039,"The moment when you do not have correct physical model to explain something so simple.\nIt is time to bring back the Aether, do all calculations again, and forgot about light particle and photon entanglement."	
20040,"Only 15% of the information in this video filtered to my brain."	
20041,"The rectiline filters that you are using for this experiment actually influence the light that passes through it! The ¨phenomenon¨ that you are observing actually is explained if the filter being a non matematical object that affects the light that goes through it.This property of matter of messing with light going through it in one direction or another is called birefringence! \nImagine for a second that the filter pivots (absorbs then reemits) the light going through it just a little bit so that it aligns with the axis in wich it let´s the light through. If this is the case it makes sense that the more times you pivot it the more light will pass in the end! \nThis is the concept behind some of your LCD screens! White light is always on behind every single one of the pixels of your screen. Between the front of your screen and the back there is a layer of liquid christals that block that light. When tension is aplied to a pixel little liquid christals allign with it progressively, that is to say that the christals near the back wall of the screen remain in their position and the front ones allign totally with it. Like this :  BACK   _\ |    FRONT \nThis acts like the series of filters now letting through a part of the light wich goes through a clored filter flies through the air and reaches your beatufill eyes you beautifull coment reader you!\nTo be honest I m pretty sure that there are plenty of other experiments that disprove the hidden variables (I could name a few if I tried to remember em) but this one does not ... as you cant truly say that it is the same photon that goes in a filter as the one that comes out. (FYI linear filters like this are made just by having liiitle tiiiiny wires all parallel to one another, wires being great at absorbing electromagnetic energy will only let light through the tiny gaps between them and will spit out some of that energy in the form of light aligned with em ...)"	
20042,"Try this: 1st len 0°, 2nd len 90° with 3rd len 0°on top. The result will be 50% brightness of the original light! Wat?! 😱"	
20043,"Wait	 you said the first experiment without a loophole was in 2015, yet Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982 showing the violation earned him a Nobel prize... So what loophole is there in his experiments?"

20045,"when i was 15 this stuff i can easily understand but lately [23] im getting horrible migrains. is that bad?"	
20046,"I know quantum physic really good. And we used the polarisation filters a lot in school. But we only used two filters and never three. And I think this video tells my why =D I'm going to study this topic a lot more in the future when I'll graduat from university. I love quantum mechanics 🚀"	
20047,"Like minutephysics, have a beard, wear glasses. Checking in."	
20048,"And thats why you look at light as a wave function in this case with filters and it all makes sense."	
20049,"In the 1780s Immanuel Kant presaged quantum weirdness though he didn't know it at the time.  What Kant claimed in Critique of Pure Reason is that reasoning is a faculty of the brain, like digestion is a faculty of the stomach/intestines.  So Kant's claimed that if ever the mind is presented with data it can't physically digest then the data will be forever confusing and unreasonable. \n\nIn the 1780s the scientific revolution was in it's childhood, but at that point it did seem like data+reasoning was absolutely perfect and would never run into trouble. Quantum weirdness, like Bell's Theorem and double-slit experiment, et al, is, me thinks, showing up reasoning as being imperfect. If this imperfection was more widely understood then we might see a reduction in the number of hard materialists with their all is determined world view that leads to fatalism and human conflict."

20078,"So it's only bad when this photog(who happens to be a woman) gets treated like this, not when a male photog gets treated the same? I wonder where all this sexism and discrimination comes from. Hmmm​..."

20100,"fuck this bitch, guys were getting pushed and shoved and she said nothing.  One touch to a woman and its red alert.  Where is all that equality now?"	
20101,"Can't see the initial interaction between the photog & bodyguard, and judging whether gender politics were a factor w/o footage is a non-starter. What you can see is a model who's paying attention to the interactions between her security and the paparazzi. Lots of celebs turn a blind eye. Or take the tack that photographers are evil, so whatever security does to them is fine. Whether Miss Hadid read the situation correctly (that her bodyguard's actions posed a physical threat to the photographer) is less important, IMO, then that she intervened (politely!) to diffuse a situation she thought might be/become dangerous to another person. Whom she had no responsibility to care for.\n\nSpeaking as a former security guard. It's very easy, when you're in that hyper-vigilant mindset, to become overzealous in the way you protect your client."	
20102,"What a bunch of parasites."	
20103,"Now we're going to see a surge in female paparazzi because they'll be able to get close enough for that money shot"

20110,"Never been a huge fan of her but I really admire her doing this!❤️"	
20111,"Bella is going cop so much shit by the anti-Feminism individuals who are easily threatened by it. I praise her for doing the right thing against unreasonable force. I do hope though that any bouncer she has who uses unreasonable force towards male photographers that she pulls them up about it too, unreasonable violence is still unreasonable violence regardless of gender."	
20112,"Bella >>> Gigi. Also how dare her employee talk back to her like that"

20123,"If a female photographer is being aggressive and isn't moving out of the way when asked then push her out of the way just as you would a male photographers. But also security should be able to do their job and protect their clients but not go over board and harm someone."

20125,"There goes his job...."	
20126,"Who the fuck is Bella Hadid?"	
20127,"Notice how the security guards are pushing all the male photographers out of the way, but as soon as one pushes the female photographer, Bella gets pissy."	
20128,"Fucken hoe, don't hire security if you don't want them to do their job properly"	
20129,"Look at me!  I'm going to publicly scold a security guard I am paying for doing his job.  Why?  I want the world to see how compassionate and concerned about the welfare of the little people.  The same little people I demand security to keep away from me.  To top it off I will go out of my way the cameras see me reach out to this riffraff by asking Are you Okay?  All the idiots who see this will buy into the ploy that I am Mother Theresa."

20136,"Hardly a rough up but nice of her to step in"	
20137,"Dumbass liberal. Don't hire them then"	
20138,"My wife is so sweet"	
20139,"So it's ok if the security roughs up a man but not a woman, and it's ok when a woman roughs up a security man? Wooooooooooow and they gonna hide behind fake feminism"	
20140,"Stupid bitch! Are you trained in Dignity Protection? I am and that innocent looking female could turn into your worse nightmare in a sec. Whatever security firm is under her employ needs to drop her quick. I guarantee if that female would have pulled out a knife and tried or was successful in stabbing her, she would sue the shit out of them.

20175,"Some in the comments claiming the phone was restarted but restart message on iPhone clearly states restart as the reason for extra authentication. Failed Touch ID attempts on the other hand will eventually result in the message Craig got on stage. Try it yourself, repeatedly touch you iPhone sensor with the wrong finger and you'll eventually get Your passcode is required to enable Touch ID.\n\nThe telling moment for me is when he rubs his face. The way he rubbed his face instantly implies he's had an issue previously. Granted, it could have been a nervous rub... Time will tell. Either way, I remain skeptical of face unlock in general. There's something about the motion and visual obstruction that hasn't grown on me. Maybe Apple will do it better or maybe we'll just deal with pass codes (many still do anyway)."

The scanner doesn't change if you are shiny because in an video apple did the girl had just been swimming. The scanner uses a 3D version of your face and the reason why it didn't work on stage was because the phone said you need to type in your code before using Face ID So I know this will work 99%"

20211,"The best part isn't that the face recognition didn't work, it's that he switched to a different phone. How did no one else catch that? It fails, then he sets it down and picks up the second phone that was sitting on the stand. No one else is commenting on this?"	
20212,"Samsung phones have it too"

20254,"This feature debuts in Android way earlier than iPhone.. This feature is a part of Android 4.0 Ice cream sandwich, But apple claims that their face id is more accurate & has 3D face regognition.. Agreed\n\nBut to be very frank we can't rely on it.. as sometimes it unlocks your phone by seeing your sibling/Mother/father face with whom you're resembling to.\n\nAnd it doesn't unlock in every scenario.. Even Android wouldn't unlock when I used to change hairstyle 😂\n\nApple could be more accurate but it can't be perfect, same happened with the guy at stage had some sweat on his face and phone didn't unlock 😂"

20263,"when an iphone restart....first it will ask for the passcode.\nThats y it was not recognising the face id."	
20264,"My bigger problem is that someone can unlock the phone without me knowing it. Say, a boyfriend can unlock my phone while I'm sleeping: simply hold the phone up to my face and that's it. The fingerprint ID is better because at least I might feel how someone touches my hand/fingers to unlock a phone, with face ID it's a no-contact operation. So... it's a privacy issue."

20272,"if someone set up the Face ID, then got an accident, and eventually got a scar on his/her face, and also forgot his passcode....."	
20273,"it was a mistake because during the rehersal the crew was constantly testing the face id and since it wasnt craig's face, it didnt open and hence, the screen appeared where u have to put in the password like in ur normal phone ,if u put several wrong fingerprints, it asks for the passcode . the same thing happened here with face id."
